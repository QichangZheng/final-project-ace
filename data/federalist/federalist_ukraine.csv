PolitiFact: Bill Kristol Lies. Fabrics And Flowers Are Really Colors,"Well this is hilarious on multiple levels. PunditFact, which brings all of PolitiFact’s partisanship and intellectual rigor to the pundit class, thinks it’s caught Bill Kristol in a huge, huge lie.

They’re more or less wrong, which isn’t unusual, but this one’s notable in part for both the pettiness and the wrongness.

Here’s the major issue on which they think The Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol will be humbled:

Bill Kristol says Ukraine’s 2004 revolution was the first ‘color revolution’

You remember the Orange Revolution, named after the color of Ukraine’s democratic party.

But PunditFact has found two earlier color revolutions, assuming that everyone in the world agrees that fabric and flowers are colors. Here’s the first:

We can trace the tradition of naming Eastern European uprisings after colors to 1989, when Czechoslovakia nonviolently overthrew its Communist government in what was known both internally and internationally as the Velvet Revolution.

Well, there you go. Some might think velvet is a type of fabric known for being smooth. But thanks to PunditFact, we know that this is a damned lie spread by Bill Kristol.

And then:

Experts generally identify three color revolutions: Rose Revolution, Georgia, 2003

Orange Revolution, Ukraine, 2004

Tulip Revolution, Kyrgyzstan, 2005

Not terribly well known, at least not relative to what happened in Ukraine, the Rose Revolution was so called — according to the article linked by PunditFact — because protesters gave roses to the soldiers. Not rose color swatches but actual flowers:

People were kissing the police and military, it was really spectacular,” said Giorgi Kandelaki, a 21-year-old student. “And the roses of course which people had with them, which Misha carried with him into the parliament hall, that was the moment when people said that it was a rose revolution.”

And for those unfamiliar with the variety of tulip colors, hop on over to Holland for a brief education.

Therefore, PunditFact explains, “Kristol was wrong when he said Ukraine’s revolution was [the first color revolution].”

I mean, it’s true that “color revolutions” is a term that’s been used to describe all sorts of revolutions, even those without actual colors. But if you accept one of the many broader definitions, then PunditFact’s claim that experts generally identify only three “color” revolutions is bizarre. I mean, depending on how broad your understanding of what a “color revolution” is, Kristol would have been off by decades or PunditFact underestimated their number by dozens. At worst, it means Kristol was mildly off by a matter of months, which really speaks to the sloppiness and pettiness of the entire PunditFact/PolitiFact operation. To call this a “false claim” is just ridiculous and tarnishes PunditFact far more than Kristol.

As soon as the piece was published, it was widely mocked. To wit:

Is this a joke??? // PunditFact – … http://t.co/15PPJnvDzO — John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) February 23, 2014

Which is probably why PunditFact quickly rewrote the piece (while I was typing this, in fact).* Or as they put it:

@MZHemingway Thanks for reading. We've updated our item to reflect the definition of ""color revolution"" is not 100 pct. literal. — PunditFact (@PunditFact) February 23, 2014

Updating is one way to put it. In fact, they basically rewrote much of the second half of the “fact” “check.” So how did they change their rating about whether Bill Kristol is a lying liar who lies?

They didn’t. He’s still got this rating on their truth-o-meter:

I do wonder if the epic takedowns of fact checking in The Weekly Standard (by someone I’m related to by marriage) haven’t led PolitiFact/PunditFact to react rather histrionically.

In case you’re interested, those include “Lies, Damned Lies, and ‘Fact Checking’: The liberal media’s latest attempt to control the discourse,” as well as “Obama’s Palace Guard: How media fact checkers made themselves of service to the president in the welfare reform debate,” and this, this, this, this, and this.

Venezuela Is Not Ukraine …Yet,"Over the last few weeks both Venezuela and Ukraine have erupted in political turmoil and violence that should surprise no one. Both countries have been ruled by elected regimes that degraded their democracies so as to extend their power while enshrining corruption and incompetence as their mode of governing.

But at some point–especially in the digital age–the people attempt to throw off their oppressors. Ukraine’s president fled even before the newly ascendant parliament voted conclusively Saturday to remove him; and Venezuela’s president is showing his weakness by demanding the opposition meet with him this week for talks. It is impossible to say that Ukraine is now set for peace and rebuilding under a new democratic and pro-Western government because Putin is unlikely to accept this humiliating repudiation and geostrategic setback. Most likely he will try either to claw back all of Ukraine and impose a new puppet, or he’ll carve off the eastern portion and make mischief that way, aided by Ukrainians who benefit from Russian suzerainty.

As to Venezuela, we are at the beginning of what could be the end of Chavismo… but that depends on what the democratic opposition and the United States do next.

How did Venezuela get to this point?

Since 1999 when the now-deceased Hugo Chavez won his first election and began to build a personalized socialist dictatorship, many observers, including this author, feared that Venezuela was headed for years of economic, social and political degradation before it could hope to resume its place as one of the hemisphere’s most promising states. That is, it would become a failed state and have to rebuild itself.

As a professional staff member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee in the late 1990s, I had read enough and heard enough about Chavez to know that he had no intention of presiding over a republic based on the rule of law and honest government, much less a free market one. As he campaigned for office against admittedly corrupt and elitist established parties, he pledged to “boil [his opponents’] heads in oil” and announced a program of statism and socialism. How any American diplomat or foreign government could have seen his election as anything but the disaster it became is beyond me. Members of Congress and Hill staffers were not in the least fooled by our meeting with the newly-elected leader when he visited the Capitol for a sit-down with the committee; all his bear-hugging and glad-handing was seen for the smoke and mirrors that it was.

During congressional delegations and meetings with the Clinton administration we warned the State Department that Venezuela was in trouble and that now was the time to make it clear to Chavez that we would not blithely accept a Venezuela that threatens the peace of the region. But the State Department’s penchant for preserving cordial relations at all costs won the day and Chavez was undisturbed and unperturbed as he built his Bolivarian Socialist Republic–and he was never again cordial after that visit to the Hill. He only got worse, ruined his country and blamed others for his faults, most notably the US as the ringleader of the “fascists” trying to bring him down.

The last fourteen years of Chavismo–for the program outlives the founder in the form of his incompetent successor Nicolas Maduro who took over at Chavez’s death last year–truly have been a disaster for Venezuelans and the people of many other countries in Latin America where similar political and economic travesties were inspired to power with Chavez’s aid. In true socialist form, some of the poor initially received more attention from the state in the form of subsidies and social goods. But the price has been high because of the corruption and incompetence endemic to all socialist regimes.

A new elite has been installed who are stealing when they are not misgoverning. Chavismo nationalized everything in sight so now nothing in the economy works, not even the formerly rich oil sector. To keep power, they have controlled the media, made the secret ballot a joke, and used access to state largesse as both a punishment and a reward. In some cases they kill and maim by means of the intelligence services and the mobs they nurture to do their dirtiest work. At this point, a dozen people are dead, scores are wounded and many are being tortured in detention.

We have seen this before in many dictatorships where socialism, cronyism and corruption have to be propped up with oppression and are sporadically challenged by citizen protest and sometimes revolution.

We have seen this before in many dictatorships where socialism, cronyism and corruption have to be propped up with oppression and are sporadically challenged by citizen protest and sometimes revolution. Sometimes these dictatorships survive the backlash as Chavez did in 2002 when he was briefly ousted in a coup attempt; sometimes they don’t as in today’s Ukraine. But now we might be at a crossroads for this country because Venezuela’s dictatorial regime has no powerful and determined friend like Russia is to the Ukrainian reactionaries who will not easily stomach losing power. Venezuela has only Cuba which can cause turmoil for the democratic opposition and threaten the people but is totally dependent on steadily declining Venezuelan largesse to survive. In short, Cuba is not the asset to Venezuela that Russia is to the pro-Russian Ukrainians.

Venezuela has another advantage that Ukraine does not: an opposition that can unite and have a chance at bringing most of the country with them. While Chavismo temporarily benefited the poor that for centuries had been ignored by successive Venezuelan regimes democratic or otherwise, it has now totally failed them. No country has more crime and lawlessness, shortages of basic goods like toilet paper and foodstuffs, and few have a higher inflation rate. Chavismo is failing the very people who first empowered it and everyone knows it. The only thing that keeps the poor supportive of Maduro is that they fear being ignored again if the opposition comes to power. But Venezuela has new opposition leaders, younger, more enlightened and more concerned for the entire population. They are effectively center-left and their leading figure, Henrique Capriles, was barely beaten by Maduro in last year’s presidential election (maybe he wasn’t beaten?) when Maduro held all the cards in a pseudo-democracy.

Given time, Capriles and the now-imprisoned opposition leader and former mayor, Leopoldo Lopez, can bring together a coalition that carries on Capriles’ inspiring campaign to govern for all Venezuelans and extend the promise of capitalism and a non-politicized welfare state to the country.

What role for the United States?

The US role is what it always should have been whether the Obama Administration appreciates it or not: support people and parties that are democratic and who seek greater freedom from oppression, and punish those who found and operate dictatorships. The Bush Administration tried to do this, though some of us felt we could have done more; the Obama Administration has done little to nothing. Aid has been cut and we have spent five years attempting to prove that if we are nice enough and turn the other cheek enough, Chavismo will moderate and the regime will stop supporting the enemies of democracy in other Latin American countries.

There is so much more we can do, such as give voice and aid to the democratic opposition, demand guarantees for the safety of its leaders, punish members of the regime with well-crafted sanctions and lead a hemispheric coalition against the oppression of Venezuelans at the Organization for American States.

Venezuela is not Ukraine not only because the democratic opposition has not toppled the regime yet, but also because it has more advantages internally and externally. It has resources and the potential to be an important trading country; it has a moderate democratic opposition; and it has no outside power willing and able to risk its own survival to keep dictators in power. This is the stuff that US foreign policy can work with. I hope we will.

How To Explain What’s Happened In Ukraine To Your Friends,"Over the last week, Ukraine became a whole different country – politically and, one might say, mentally. The protests that have been going on in the nation’s capital, Kyiv, as well as over the country, for three months, resulted in the president being ousted from his post. However, this achievement came at a great cost: More than 80 people died during the last few days, and many are still fighting for their lives in hospitals. What caused this uprising and how the protesters managed to change the situation is explained shortly here.

What drove people to the streets?

The protests were triggered in late November of 2013 by the fact that the Ukrainian government refused to sign an agreement with the European Union (EU), which would facilitate trade between Ukraine and the European countries and make economic processes in Ukraine more transparent. This agreement had been anticipated by Ukrainian business and citizens alike as a chance to save struggling economy and as an opening to a possible membership in the European Union in the future. Being abruptly denied this opportunity, people gathered for a rally on Kyiv’s central Independence square or, as it is named in Ukrainian, the Maidan. And the protests that started off since have been dubbed “the Euromaidan.”

How did it all turn so violent?

Protests began as a peaceful demonstration demanding the resignation of the cabinet of ministers who failed to secure the European treaty, with middle class and students being the basic group of participants. The rallies, however, were not successful and looked likely to end without bringing any significant change. But then one night, riot police attacked the people at the square and cruelly beat them. Next morning, with videos of police brutality going viral, more people joined the protesters. After another attack of riot police mere days after that, one could find hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians from all over the country protesting in Kyiv. In other big cities, protests were happening, too, some of them resulting in the occupying of regional administrations.

What was the response of the government?

The pro-presidential political party that held the majority of seats in Ukrainian parliament reacted with passing of a number of laws criminalizing protest activity in mid-January 2014. Rigging the votes to get the laws adopted, the ruling party MPs made it illegal to go on a rally, to set up a protest tent, to occupy governmental buildings, and to publish articles discussing unlawful actions of public officials. From unprecedented limits on international NGOs to absurd prohibitions on wearing a helmet and having more than 5 cars in a row on streets (‘Yay, no more traffic jams!’, Ukrainians commented with sarcasm), the new rules, named “dictatorship laws,” were aimed to curb the protests.

Did it work?

Actually, people reacted with even bigger demonstrations, escalating in clashes with riot police. Police killed two protesters with guns. One of the protesters died of wounds, and another was found frozen to death in a forest after being kidnapped and tortured. Several protest leaders fled abroad. One of them, a leader of the protest-on-wheels group known as the Automaidan, was transported to get treatment in Europe after being abducted and tortured into saying he was a US spy. Many activists were arrested with possible prison terms ranging from 8 to 15 years. This pushed government and the opposition to negotiations. After the loss of lives and police atrocities, new faces in the same system was not enough. Protesters demanded resignation of the president and a change of Ukrainian constitution, which would take away central powers from the president.

Did the government meet the demands?

On the 18th of February, a parliamentary session was scheduled that was supposed to introduce the negotiated changes to the constitution. However, the pro-presidential party refused to address this issue during the session. After that, the protesters stormed police cordons and some of them were killed. Protesters were pushed back to the central square, where the clashes continued. During the next two days, as clashes ended and the protesters were trying to restore the barricades, more than 70 people were killed by snipers, the riot police and hired thugs that cooperated with the police. The victims did not hold firearms and some were without protective vests. And several wounded protesters are reported to have died in a fire that consumed a building near the Independence square.

The tragic losses and murder orders prompted some pro-presidential MPs to join the opposition in voting for cease-fire decree in the parliament. A new majority with more ruling party MPs adding to its numbers voted for the changes to the constitution that made the president less powerful. A treaty was signed between the president and the oppositional leadership that sought to ban riot police from using guns and to set up early elections at the end of this year. Protesters, however, did not agree with the president being in office for another 9 months. A leader of one of self-defense paramilitary groups made an ultimatum for the president: if he does not resign, protesters will storm his private residence. Over the next couple of hours, the president left Kyiv, and the parliament set the date of next presidential elections on the 25th of May 2014.

What is happening now?

Current whereabouts of the former president are unknown. Meanwhile, the parliament passed the laws allowing release of political prisoners, one of whom is the former prime minister. Local conflicts continue in several cities. In Sevastopol, a city in Crimea that has a special status due to hosting a Russian navy base, there has been a rally that refused to recognize the local city government and elected a Russian citizen as an alternative head of city administration. A video of Russian armored vehicles in Crimea has appeared. The Russian Federation has not yet recognized current Ukrainian government.

What has been the role of international community in Ukrainian events?

Different countries and international organizations, such as the United Nations and the European parliament, called for peace and justice in Ukraine. Diplomatic representatives of the USA and the EU were present in Ukraine during the protests warning against the use of force against the protesters. Poland and Lithuania let in wounded Ukrainian protesters to receive medical treatment. Russia’s role has influenced the protests, too. First, a $15 billion loan suggested by Russia was the alternative that the Ukrainian government chose instead of the agreement with the EU. Second, more billions were promised to Ukraine before the biggest crackdown of the protests that involved mass killings. However, Russia revoked this offer after the resignation of the president, citing the absence of a new government as a reason.

Who are the people that went out on the protests?

People from different geographical regions of Ukraine and social groups took part in the protests. Sociological survey held at the beginning of February showed that 88 percent of those who continuously took part in the Euromaidan, were men, and women comprised 12 percent. More than half of all of them belonged to the 30-54 years age group, and 44 percent represented middle class – professionals and private entrepreneurs.

Ukraine Illustrates The Danger Of Entrusting Foreign Policy To Top Men,"The past two days have revealed the dangerous ramifications of the narrow-minded foreign policy elite in Washington, and a media establishment that has for so much of President Obama’s tenure accepted the statements of the administration as gospel. Just as we learned the dangers of the lack of a questioning element – a healthy, serious, skeptical voice in the room – within the administration of George W. Bush, so too we see the consequences of a narrow viewpoint on global affairs which now exists within the Obama administration.

As Eli Lake outlines, the decision of Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine came as a sudden shock to a Washington that less than a day earlier had dismissed such possibilities:

On Thursday night, the best assessment from the U.S. intelligence community—and for that matter most experts observing events in Ukraine—was that Vladimir Putin’s military would not invade Ukraine. Less than 24 hours later, however, there are reports from the ground of Russian troops pushing into the Ukrainian province of Crimea; the newly-installed Crimean prime minister has appealed to Putin to help him secure the country; Putin, in turn, is officially asking for parliament's permission to send Russian forces into Ukraine. It’s not a full-blown invasion—at least, not yet. But it’s not the picture U.S. analysts were painting just a day before, either… U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence on the fast moving situation in Ukraine tell The Daily Beast that analytic products from the intelligence community this week did not discount the prospect of Russian provocations and even light incursions in the Russian majority province of Crimea, the home of Russia’s fleet in the Black Sea. Nonetheless, until Friday, no one anticipated a Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory.

These officials were not alone. At Foreign Affairs, the headline was “Why Russia Won’t Invade Ukraine”; at The New York Times, “Why Russia Won’t Interfere”; and at Time, “No, Russia Will Not Intervene in Ukraine”. Joshua Tucker at The Washington Post has already had to change the now-ludicrous title of his post, explaining:

Those who have already read this post (including the first 15 commentators below) will know that I originally posted with the title “5 reasons for everyone to calm down about Crimea”. Developments in the ensuing hours have shown how poor a title that turned out to be.

It’s no surprise that, given the echo chamber of the media, the administration itself gives all the signs of being caught flat-footed, unable to adjust to the situation that runs against their preconceived notions and those of the chattering class:

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke with Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu on March 1, telling him that there was 'no change' in the U.S.'s military posture toward Ukraine in the hours after Russia's parliament approved a Russian military presence in Ukraine.

If this is the sort of foreign policy anticipation that the establishment delivers, it’s little surprise that no one trusts America’s self-styled policy elites any more. They are too used to judging the world according to the patterns toward which they are already biased, as opposed to seeing it as it is.

As for the situation in Crimea itself: while the 1994 Budapest Memorandum does not require that the United States enter into this current conflict, as it is not a formal treaty, it does make the situation for the Obama administration a great deal more complicated than, say, the 2008 situation in Georgia. The Ukrainian situation has a nuclear subtext which matters in the broader context: because Ukraine had to surrender its nuclear arsenal as part of the 1994 agreement, U.S. inaction now sends a signal that nations ought to maintain their nuclear arsenal as opposed to trusting the Americans to defend their legitimacy. The mix of Polish, Turkish, and Russian interests here make for an all the more dangerous situation given the spillover potential of a major crisis.

What ought to be a first priority in this context is the administration’s opportunity to position itself as ready to use the leverage of international economic policy and energy policy to dissuade the Russians from their current trajectory or, at least, loosen Putin’s stranglehold on European energy markets. U.S. law currently prevents American energy producers from freely exporting natural gas or crude oil to anywhere even remotely near Europe. To remedy this glaring economic and geopolitical mistake, the president (who has shown no qualms about using sweeping definitions of executive power in other areas) could issue blanket executive orders declaring all US natural gas exports to be in the “public interest” and all crude oil exports to be in the “national interest”, the applicable legal standards for both commodities.

While immediate gas exports directly to Europe would be limited by a lack of U.S. export facilities (thanks, again, to glacial government policy), crude exports could begin instantly and US gas could be exported thru Canada and Mexico. At the very least, these moves would serve as a significant signal to global energy markets and to the Russians that the United States fully intends to use its newfound energy abundance to stabilize global markets and counterbalance Russian influence across the Atlantic. At best, they might actually help to weaken Russian energy oligarchs and, by extension, Putin himself.

Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, who have both recently expressed support for US energy export liberalization (Cruz especially), should take up this message at once. It represents an opportunity to use expanded trade freedom and American economic might to prevent further loss of life and signal the United States’ seriousness on the matter, without firing a single American bullet. And, unlike the United Nations or the World Trade Organization, it is a step that can be done unilaterally with, quite literally, the stroke of the President’s pen.

In the meantime, at least the president himself is taking it seriously.

The Eighties Called: Do We Want Their Foreign Policy Back?,"You may recall a notorious moment from one of the 2012 president debates when President Obama cited Mitt Romney’s warning about the growing threat from Russia and dismissed it with a snarky one-liner: “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.”

Fast forward a year or so, and President Obama faces the biggest foreign policy crisis of his presidency: Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which brings the curses of war and imperial conquest back to Europe.

Let’s dispense, by the way, with the journalistic evasion of calling this an “invasion of Crimea,” as if the Crimean Peninsula were not part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine. While Putin may be particularly interested in securing the Russian naval base at Sevastopol, he knows very well that he can’t hold Crimea on its own, since it is dependent on the mainland for power and water. No, it’s clear that Putin is interested in carving off a large Russian-speaking slice of Eastern Ukraine. It’s just as clear he would like to take all of Ukraine, which is why he and his mouthpieces have been busy delegitimizing the new Ukrainian government and denouncing the victorious opposition in Kiev as “fascists,” which is most definitely a fighting word.

Putin is reviving the Brezhnev Doctrine, in which the Soviet Union declared that it could invade any country that tried to escape its domination. The Brezhnev Doctrine was summed up as “once you go Communist, you never go back.” Putin’s version is a bit cruder. The Putin Doctrine is: once you become a kleptocratic dictatorship subservient to Moscow, you never go back.

So what do we do? How can we roll back Soviet—er, Russian—aggression?

The 1980s are calling. They want to know if we want their foreign policy back.

Why should we look to the 1980s? Because that was the decade when we broke the Brezhnev Doctrine. By the end of the 80s, as Eastern European countries began to throw off the Communist yoke, the Brezhnev Doctrine yielded to the Sinatra Doctrine: Russia would let the countries of Eastern Europe do it their way.

What lessons can we learn for a new age of Russian imperialism?

First, when the aggression comes, it’s too late. President Reagan was mortified, when the Soviets demanded a crackdown on the Solidarity movement in 1981, that there was so little America could do about it, given the decline of our military power in the backlash against the Vietnam War. Barack Obama finds himself in in the same situation, given the decline of American military power that he has presided over in the backlash against the Iraq War.

But Reagan found plenty to do in Poland without using our military power. We imposed sanctions against the Polish regime and the Soviet Union, and throughout the 80s we gave Solidarity everything from moral support, to money, equipment, and training.

We did the same thing on a bigger scale in Afghanistan, providing extensive covert military assistance to the Afghan insurgency, including intelligence, training, and huge quantities of weapons. This famously included Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles, which so terrified Soviet pilots that ground troops began to refer to them as “cosmonauts” because they would stay at high altitude and refused to offer close air support.

Afghanistan was the last place the Soviets implemented the Brezhnev Doctrine, and they soon regretted it. But Afghanistan was never just about Afghanistan. It was about breaking the world’s fear of the Red Army. The message was: if we can do this to you in Afghanistan, imagine what we can do to you in Poland.

Or central America, where American weapons and training helped beat back Communist insurgents in El Salvador, and just the suggestion of US support summoned into existence a resistance army to oppose the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. We made similar efforts to roll back Communist expansion in Cambodia and Angola.

Please note, as a lesson to anti-interventionists on both the left and the right, that all of these actions were indirect and comparatively small in scale. This is the real truth of “peace through strength”: the stronger and more vigorous our policy, the less we actually have to do.

In fact, the biggest direct military intervention of the Reagan era was a US invasion of the tiny island of Grenada. This action was small but important, putting a quick end to Cuba’s attempt to militarize the Caribbean.

All of these specific interventions were backed by a wider policy: a renewed commitment to support our NATO allies and a massive military buildup backed by an economic revival. This was the material backing for renewed ideological opposition to the Soviets, including repeated public recognition of the evil of Soviet domination, from the “evil empire” to “tear down this wall.”

All of this was summed up in the Reagan Doctrine: a commitment to counter the Soviets and roll back their influence worldwide, point for point. This came from the president whose strategy for the Cold War was: “We win, they lose.”

If President Reagan could see what Russia is doing today, he would cock his head and say, “Well, there they go again.” And then he would deploy the whole panoply of resistance we used against Moscow in his day. He might start with the fact that Poland has strong ties to Ukraine’s pro-European majority and a direct interest in opposing Russia, making the Poles an obvious conduit for support to the new government in Kiev—both open and covert, and both economic and military. The Baltic states are also freaking out, given their own vulnerability to Russian aggression, and they can be counted on for extensive support. The urgent priority is to rapidly convert Western Ukraine into a “porcupine state”—one that may not be able to win a war with Russia outright, but can make such a war too painful to be appealing.

Instead, we get President Obama’s totally ineffectual response, in which he spends 90 minutes on the phone to warn Vladimir Putin that invading Ukraine would “negatively impact Russia’s standing in the international community.” As Julia Ioffe replies: “as if there’s much left or as if Putin really cares.”

Implementing the lessons of the 1980s will require a lot of money and a lot of effort, and some tough decisions that will be very unpopular in the halls of the United Nations. It will also require something this president has found even more difficult to do: challenging the preconceived notions of the left.

But we know what it looks like when American weakness and uncertainty allow an aggressive dictatorship and its allies to advance across the world. To avoid that outcome, we need to reverse course and do it fast.

If we don’t, pretty soon the 1970s will be calling.

How to Kick Putin in the Teeth,"For the past week, we’ve had to put up with a lot of grey little men from the foreign policy establishment lamenting that there’s really nothing we can do to deter Vladimir Putin from grabbing part or all of Ukraine. This is just a process of rationalization for the fact that they don’t really want us to try.

The do-nothing caucus will get a boost from Putin’s decision to pause as he digests Crimea. Putin may be irrational, but he’s not crazy. He has a good intuitive sense for how the West, and particularly the Obama administration, makes decisions. Or fails to make them. So he knows to act rapidly and decisively, overwhelming unprepared Western analysts and leaders with new facts on the ground. Then, just as they are beginning to formulate a response, stop and calm everything down so that the grey little men can assure us that the crisis is over and there is no need for urgent action.

But the crisis has not passed, because Putin’s larger intention remains. Putin’s authoritarian rule has been described as “Stalin Lite,” and it’s now clear that the goal of his foreign policy is to rebuild a “Soviet Union Lite.” He will keep stirring up trouble and probing for weakness in Eastern Ukraine, looking for the pretext and the opportunity to either grab another chunk of Ukraine or destabilize the central government. Other former Soviet states with significant Russian populations are certainly taking this seriously. They fear they’re next.

What’s at stake for the US is very simple. We’ve forgotten what’s like to have a big, active geopolitical opponent who’s stirring up trouble and supporting hostile regimes everywhere in the world. That is what Putin is doing, and the fact that he’s doing it in Eastern Europe is particularly threatening. We have enough trouble everywhere else in the world, so we need to know that Europe, at least, is civilized and stable, a place where we can find allies and trading partners—and not a zone of conflict. Now Putin is bringing war and aggression back to Europe.

The tragedy is that we’re plenty strong enough militarily, economically, and diplomatically to crush Putin’s ambitions. I have recommended using the Reagan Doctrine of the 1980s as an inspiration, but breaking Soviet Union Lite won’t take nearly as much money or effort as it took to defeat the original article. Putin’s new Russian empire is far smaller and weaker, having been reduced in territory, population, military readiness, and global influence.

So let’s get started. Putin has crossed too many lines, and it’s time to bring down the hammer. I’m not talking about what we can do to send him a warning or maybe punish him a little bit. I’m talking about what we can do to knock him down and kick him in the teeth.

Right now, Russia gets the shirtless manly man, while we’re stuck with Pajama-Boy-in-Chief. But Putin’s action-hero photo ops are staged, and it’s all just a big bluff. It’s time to expose Putin for what he is: a swaggering loud-mouth who talks big but gets his tail kicked the first time a real man decides to fight back.

Here is a list of suggested counterpunches.

First, we should do something that we are already doing: John Kerry should go to Kiev and stay there until Putin pulls his tanks back from the border. We need to do what we did when Putin invaded Georgia in 2008: send in a rotating contingent of Western foreign ministers and heads of state, letting Putin know that if he wants to advance on Kiev he’s going to have to threaten the top leaders of all the Western powers. It’s a way of extending a de facto military umbrella over the Western half of Ukraine and the central government without having to do it officially.

With this implicit defense in place, we should immediately begin helping Ukraine transform itself into a porcupine state capable of filling the Russian bear’s nose with prickles.

Putin’s pause after taking Crimea is a brilliant strategy, if he assumes that Western leaders don’t want to have to think about Ukraine and really don’t want to have to do anything about it. But if anyone in Kiev, Europe, or Washington has any gumption, then this pause is a colossal blunder. It will allow the new Ukrainian government an opportunity to regroup, to assure the loyalty of its armed forces (placed in doubt by a few key defections), and to consolidate its hold over Ukraine’s Eastern provinces. A few days ago, I was concerned that the Russians might be able to drive a column of tanks straight into Kiev without any organized resistance. But Putin’s pause has probably ensured that Crimea is all he can take without a nasty fight.

And Crimea may well be untenable on its own. It is, after all, a peninsula, connected to the mainland by the narrow little Perokop Isthmus, through which moves most of Crimea’s electricity, water, and food. So why not tell the Russians that if they want to occupy Crimea, they will be dark, hungry and thirsty? Putin’s approach to the remaining loyal Ukrainian forces in Crimea has been, not to shoot them, but to lay siege to them and wait them out. Once the government in Kiev feels secure in its hold on the East, it can besiege the besiegers. If Ukraine wants to be more provocative, it should launch a raid to sabotage the ferry terminal at Kerch, the closest point in Crimea to Russia, to prevent Russian reinforcements and resupply, tightening the siege.

The Ukrainian armed forces are much smaller than Russia’s—about 130,000 troops versus Russia’s 850,000. But those Russian troops have a whole lot of other territory to defend, so in practice, a fight in Ukraine would be a lot more balanced, even accounting for some mixed loyalties and defections on the Ukrainian side. Ukraine even makes its own anti-tank missiles, which would come in handy. Where Ukraine is overmatched, and where we can help the most, is with its air defenses. As a start, how about deploying an American-staffed battery of Patriot anti-ballistic missiles to Ukraine?

For that matter, we should revive the anti-ballistic missile facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic that President Obama canceled in 2009. The justification for that action was that the Russians aren’t a threat to Europe, so we shouldn’t be going out of our way to antagonize them. That premise has proven to be more than a little naive.

But military opposition is just the beginning. Just as potent is our economic power.

We should immediately impose economic sanctions on Russia, freeze the assets of its top officials, cut off its banks from the international economy, and impose trade restrictions—and we should require others to do it, just as we did when we were still trying to impose sanctions on Iran. We don’t do a lot of business with Russia, but Western Europe does, so this means we’re going to have to be tough will some of our allies, particularly Britain, which may want to protect the business it does with Russia’s politically connected billionaires, its “oligarchs.”

But Russia is only about 2% of the global economy. They need us a whole lot more than we need them.

Moreover, Putin is weak at home. His rule depends on shutting up his critics, and he may not have public support for his Ukraine adventure. Meanwhile, Russians are snapping up dollars and euros in a panic.

For the past twenty years, Russians have gotten used to the benefits of being connected to the global economy. There is the general benefit of being in an economy that is connected to global trade, and there is the individual benefit of being able to buy goods from abroad and also to seek business and employment abroad. What if we cut off those benefits? Let’s make sure every Russian knows how much Putin is going to cost them.

The only thing we would really miss if we shut off Russia’s economy is its oil and gas. Europe is particularly dependent on it. Fortunately, the fracking revolution in America makes us perfectly capable of solving this problem by flooding the world with cheap oil and gas. We could help provide for the immediate needs of Europe and Ukraine with shipments of liquid natural gas. Over the long run, what would really hurt Russia is an increase in supply that drives down oil and gas prices, reducing one of the Russian economy’s main sources of revenue.

This is what helped bury the Soviet Union. High oil prices in the 1970s propped up the Brezhnev regime—but the lower prices of the 80s left his successors unable to pay their bills. We can do that again. All that is required is to lift restrictions on exploration and production in the US, and to lift the ridiculous ban on exporting American oil. And while we’re at it, we can help the Ukrainians frack their own natural gas.

Then there’s diplomacy. Over at RealClearWorld, Alex Berezow has a good run-down of actions to take against Putin, which includes, “All democratic embassies in Russia should be closed.” But this is perhaps a bit too symbolic. Putin fancies himself a hard man who only respects action. So here’s something more substantive. The United States has entered into a couple of big international agreements, on Syria and Iran, that were brokered by Russia and are dependent on cooperation with Putin. These agreements serve Putin’s interests by allowing him to cultivate client states in the Middle East while blocking US action in the region. What they do for our interests isn’t so clear. So throw out the agreements with Syria and Iran. They’re falling apart anyway. Tell Putin that if he wants those agreements back, he’s going to have to talk to us.

Finally, we should resume the great project of expanding NATO. Certainly, we should renew our commitment to existing NATO nations that are under Russian threat, sending US troops to places like Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia as a guarantee against further aggression. We should then start putting Ukraine on a fast track to prepare it for NATO membership.

In the meantime, we should encourage our NATO allies in Eastern Europe—the ones who are also under Russian threat—to help defend Ukraine. As an intermediate step, I’ll return to a suggestion Jack Wakeland and I offered during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008: form a new Warsaw Pact against Russia, a US-sponsored military alliance of states which, like Ukraine, are the borderlands between Russia and the West. Such an alliance would have the advantage of being more willing to assert itself in this kind of conflict because all of its members would share the same vital interest in stopping even small acts of Russian aggression.

Finally, we need to do as much of this as we can right now. We shouldn’t start by merely threatening to do these things or offering to negotiate about them. Let’s not treat Putin’s aggression in Ukraine as if it were the first provocation that indicates that maybe Putin’s heart isn’t in the right place. That happened a long time ago. Treat this as the last provocation that demonstrates Putin’s evil intent and makes it an urgent necessity to shut him down.

So far, Putin has been way inside our decision cycle, moving troops on the ground while our leaders are still just trying to figure out what’s going on. In the OODA loop—Observe, Orient, Decide, Act—Putin has been in the “A” mode, while President Obama can’t quite manage the first “O.”

Let’s put the shoe on the other foot. We need to act in a way that is big, sweeping, complex, and fast, leaving Putin as the one who is confused and scrambling to catch up, So implement all of this fully, right away. If Putin wants us to reverse any of it, he can ask to negotiate after we’ve made our move.

These are the things we might do if we had real, decisive leaders in the Washington. Perhaps that’s too much to expect from this administration, but let’s at least stop pretending that good options don’t exist. They do, and if we don’t use them, the fault isn’t our resources. It’s our leadership.

"Reject Naive Foreign Policy, Whatever Its Source","The crisis in Ukraine and the failure of the Obama Administration, the foreign policy establishment, and the administration’s media defenders to accurately judge the character and priorities of Vladimir Putin should prompt a moment of reflection on the part of Americans on the right and left who feel the approach of the past two presidential administrations to global affairs has been sorely lacking on a number of fronts. In the unlikely event that the correct lessons are taken from it, this remarkably public failure – the latest in a series of mistaken assumptions from Washington – could prompt a gradual return to a more clear-eyed assessment of the challenges ahead in the next administration.

Clearly President Obama’s naivete about the consequences of American weakness is a problem. It is provocative, it is incoherent, and it leads inexorably to events like these. This weakness is not confined to the sphere of defense policy, as is often cited by the hawkish right – but also a willful decision to shift away from the United States’ decades of leadership on the international stage in matters of trade. This retreat is not merely measured in the administration’s inactivity on free trade agreements or at the World Trade Organization, but also in policies designed to please domestic constituencies like energy exports and protectionism.

Consider just one aspect of this latter policy failure: liquified natural gas (LNG) exports, where the Obama administration has dragged its heels repeatedly on export license and facility construction approvals. The first LNG export terminal – for an export license application filed in 2010 – won’t be online until 2015. No other export facilities have been approved, and there is a backlog of pending export license applications. What’s the consequence of these delays? Right now, when it would be enormously advantageous for U.S. allies and non-free trade agreement partners to be able to secure alternative U.S. energy supplies instead of Vladimir Putin’s resources, that resource is completely absent. Why? Not because of a lack of industry buy-in or resources here, but because of matters directly under Obama’s own control. These are the ramifications of a policy approach which prioritizes domestic political positioning over U.S. leadership in the global economic sphere. America’s absence has allowed for other nations to fill the gap, diminishing U.S. influence and leaving our allies with nowhere else to turn.

Foreign policy elites on right and left are locked in a rhetorical debate over where Obama falls on the spectrum – how realist he has been, how successful he has been, and what legacy he will leave on the world stage. Thus, the Council on Foreign Relations’ Fred Kaplan argues – in a piece written pre-Ukraine kerfuffle – that Obama’s presidency has been a smashing vindication of “hard-nosed realism”, Responding from the right, former George W. Bush adviser Kori Schake argues he’s behaved like nothing of the sort, and that Ukraine is the perfect example of it.

In year six of his presidency, the realist moniker seems very inaccurate to me. The problem of Obama’s foreign policy is the same naïvete that animates the academic left in general. It is a prejudice which suggests that talk can alter fundamental priorities and redirect the long-term priorities of nation-states. As Schake notes: “The Obama administration’s bedrock belief is that this president is so special, so compelling an orator and a personality, that other countries will forego their own interests—an affront to the thinking of any realist.”

But it’s not as if Obama and his allies have a monopoly on naïvete. The problem with modern liberal internationalist politicians is that they truly believe we’ve evolved past violence, hence talk from even smart leaders such as Angela Merkel about Putin living in a different world. Doesn’t he know that this sort of activity is the old way of getting things done? The problem with the neoconservatives is an implicit agreement with the end but not the means.

Under President Bush’s second term, we saw neoconservatives at their most naïve. Today they are still coming to grips with the world in the wake of the Arab Spring and the fact that John McCain no longer speaks for the center of the post-Tea Party GOP. And as John Agresto wrote in Commentary in 2012, they are still considering what lessons to take from the failures of the democracy movement:

We political scientists have something of a professional fiction. We think that the type of government people live under shapes their culture. Indeed, we believe that political life shapes human character. So, we think that aristocracies produce people with aristocratic desires, that tyrannies produce a culture of fear and dependency with slavish or vicious subjects, and that democracies produce people who are peaceful, and understanding of difference. But this might simply be backwards. I was always struck by Alexis de Tocqueville’s comment that Americans were on the way to being a democratic people long before establishing a democratic government. We served on colonial juries where we listened to both sides before we rendered judgment on our fellow citizens. We had professional, civic, and social institutions that taught us how to work together. We fought the Revolutionary War against the British Crown, a war in which perhaps a third of our citizens were on the British side and yet after the war there were no show trials, no recriminations, no mass graves. To do it the other way around—to begin with a democratic government and hope for a people with a democratic outlook and habits to grow as a result—is more often than not a fool’s errand… “Don’t all people yearn for freedom?” we have asked. And we assume the answer is yes. But the answer is no. Some people, perhaps most people, prefer other goods. Indeed, some people would rather be holy than free, or safe than free, or be instructed in how they should lead their lives rather than be free. Many prefer the comfort of strong answers already given rather than the openness and hazards of freedom. There are those who would never dream of substituting their will for the imam’s or pushing their desires over the customs and traditions of their families. Some men kiss their chains.

The neoconservatives are not the only faction of the right struggling to adapt their worldview to reality. Their allies, traditional pro-Defense hawks, are working to balance their prioritization of American power projection and the nature of today’s defense demands with an increasingly fiscally conservative base (consider the Romney 2012 campaign as indicative of this tension, with his accurate assessment of Russia alongside his call for dramatic expansions of Keynesian military spending). While neoconservatives speak to foreign policy issues frequently, it’s worth noting that they are a relatively small faction, and it is only the most recent period of post-9/11 policy when they have held sway in the White House – and then, support for their aims was achieved only through an alliance with the Jacksonian strong defense standard (hence the WMD rationale) which has long driven policy on the modern-day right.

Looking back at Bush’s second term and Obama’s tenure, you’ll see a policy conversation bouncing between naïve views of the world from the neoconservative right and the academic left. We have gone from a bias toward the assumption that we would be greeted as liberators and attempt nationbuilding in Iraq to, a decade later, a bias toward the assumption that John Kerry complaining to deaf ears about all matter of treaties Putin has violated will make Russia reconsider its course of action.

Of course, Kerry was a champion of the nuclear freeze in the Eighties, the subject of this 1983 piece from Columbia senior Barack Obama. Reading it today, it is difficult to tell how much it differs from the premises of President Barack Obama 31 years later. As Jonah Goldberg notes, Obama’s approach then seems reflected in his attitude now.

The false equivalence between the Soviet Union and the United States at root in Kerry’s and Obama’s positioning on eliminating nuclear weapons in the 1980s reflects the difference between the nature of the false assumptions on the left and the right. The mistake of the administration of Barack Obama, like most of the foreign policy establishment today, is to assume other actors in the world have no moral agency. The George W. Bush Administration, even in the depths of its self-delusion, never made this mistake – instead, they misunderstood the balance and effect of incentives upon that moral agency.

Can the events of the past few weeks in Crimea and Ukraine prompt a moment of reflection on the part of these established views? Walter Russell Mead touches on this in an extremely insightful piece, noting that “the [enlightened] ideas and beliefs help people rise through the machinery of the American power system… can get in the way when it comes to understanding the motives and calculations of people like President Putin.” He concludes:

The big question of course, is what President Obama will take away from this experience. Has he lost confidence in the self-described (and self-deceived) ‘realists’ who led him down the primrose path with their empty happy talk and their beguiling but treacherous illusions? Has he rethought his conviction that geopolitics and strategy are relics of a barbarous past with no further relevance in our own happy day? Is he tired of being humiliated on the international stage? Is it dawning on him that he has actual enemies rather than difficult partners out there, and that they wish him ill and seek to harm him? (Again, we are not talking about the GOP in Congress.) Let’s hope so. There are almost three years left in this presidential term, and they could be very long ones if President Obama chooses to stick with the ideas and approaches he’s been using so far.

Mead’s parenthetical stings: imagine for a moment how much more effective Obama would be if he treated Putin the way he treats Republicans in Washington, where he seems to be far more “hard-nosed”. He approaches negotiation with the GOP as a direct threat to his power to do whatever he wants – but on the world stage, he sees a collection of nation-states standing at the ready to ditch their long-held priorities in favor of a new reality of ongoing dialogue.

The Obama Administration is extremely unlikely to wake up to the downfalls of its approach to global affairs. But the right should avoid the temptation to fall prey to their old biases in this moment. It’s time for a forceful call for a return to living in a reality-based world, and for rejecting the naïvete of both the neoconservative right and the academic left. Someone running in 2016 should make this case, and do the necessary groundwork for it. Otherwise, we’re just going to be swinging between the naïvete which marked Bush’s second term and Obama’s tenure for the forseeable future.

Obama’s Foreign Policy Failure,"Remember these words from President Obama?

“Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years.”

The foreign policy of the 1980’s brought down the Soviet Union. It would appear that Obama’s foreign policy is bringing it back.

We are fewer than two years past that debate and Russia has invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation. The Ukrainian people took to the street to demand freedom and democracy and to protest a government that allowed neither. When the government attempted to violently crush the demonstrations the people overthrew the government. As we know:

“Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin however, contends: the government in Ukraine, the people’s government, is illegitimate because the leader, Yanukovych, was illegally overthrown; that Yanokuvych remains Ukraine’s legitimate leader; that Russia has a right to use military force in Ukraine because the ousted Yanukovych (the legitimate leader according to Russia) formally asked for Russian for assistance in quelling the revolt.

To which the President of the United States responded, “President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations but I don’t think that’s fooling anybody.” Well, there’s a strong statement from a powerful man.

In 1982, the USSR-controlled Polish government declared Solidarity, the first non-communist union in the Soviet Bloc, to be illegal. Ronald Reagan let the world know where America stood:

“I know Poland is a faraway country in Eastern Europe. Still, this action is a matter of profound concern to all the American people and to the free world… The Polish military leaders and their Soviet backers have shown that they will continue to trample upon the hopes and aspirations of the majority of the Polish people. America cannot stand idly by in the face of these latest threats of repression and acts of repression by the Polish Government…The Polish regime should understand that we're prepared to take further steps as a result of this further repression in Poland. We are also consulting urgently with our allies on steps we might take jointly in response to this latest outrage… when anyone is denied freedom, then freedom for everyone is threatened. The struggle in the world today for the hearts and minds of mankind is based on one simple question: Is man born to be free, or slave? In country after country, people have long known the answer to that question. We are free by divine right. We are the masters of our fate, and we create governments for our convenience. Those who would have it otherwise commit a crime and a sin against God and man.”

Strangely, in his February 28 statement about events in Ukraine, Obama never uttered the word “freedom.” Instead, he said:

“Throughout this crisis, we have been very clear about one fundamental principle: The Ukrainian people deserve the opportunity to determine their own future… we are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine. Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine, including cultural and economic ties, and a military facility in Crimea, but any violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe. It would represent a profound interference in matters that must be determined by the Ukrainian people… the United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine.”

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

The nation that once said big things, did big things, and led the world, now confronts Russian aggression with talk of “lawyers” and “people deserving the opportunity to determine own future.” The world perceives America as weak and perception is reality.

What happens when America is weak? The world is less safe. Syria crosses “red lines” with impunity, Iran and North Korea flex their muscles, Russia invades neighboring states, and al Qaeda does not—contrary to Obama’s 2012 campaign spin—run.

America has suffered terrorist attacks at home, Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon, and abroad, Benghazi—for which no one has been brought to justice. Are we safer today than when Obama took office?

No, we are not. Since our nation’s birth, the fundamental purpose of our government is to defend its people, to ensure our liberty. If Obama fails to perform this most basic purpose he should not pursue vast domestic undertakings like Obamacare. Because, if Obama cannot keep our nation free and safe, health care will be the least of our concerns.

Russia Proves That Democracy Has Little To Do With Liberty,"I’ll let the experts churn out opinions on what should be done about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (or is it the former Ukraine, yet?). But it does appear that many of them refuse to accept a number of truths about the world. For instance: 1- Most people do not shares our values. 2 – Most people don’t even understand our values. 3- Authoritarianism is often more popular than freedom. 4 – Democracy and liberalism are not the same. (I argue this point – not coincidentally! — in detail in my new book, The People Have Spoken (And They Are Wrong): The Case against Democracy.)

Putin may face international disapproval from the West over his Crimean actions, and he may even have to deal with some short-term ineffectual sanctions; but at home, he’s enjoying his highest approval ratings in years. Yet, we act as if Putin is acting alone. Before the invasion, the respected Levada Center found that 65 percent of respondents approved of Putin’s leadership. According to the Guardian, the less respected pollsters at VTsIOM, gauged Russian attitudes on 1-2 March and found that nearly 68 percent of respondents approved of Putin’s job performance. That was right as Russian troops were entering Crimea, so expect that number to go up.

Putin has enjoyed 60 percent approval rating throughout his career, and often much higher. Despite a stagnating economy, a Pew Poll in 2012 found that 72 percent thought Putin was doing a good job. It’s the kind of support that — apart from some fleeting moments of history – is, thankfully, unachievable in a healthy democratic nation. Despite some of the political rhetoric we hear at home, too much unity reflects poorly on a nation’s health.

And the more Putin undermines liberal institutions the more popular he becomes. The people who vote for the presidents of Russia and the United States view are unrelated, emerging from distinct historical, moral and ideological perspectives. So expecting people — even people given a vote — to act in what we consider a logical manner, is a waste of time. While we, for example, may be confused about the harsh fate of Pussy Riot!, only 5 percent of Russians believed that the punk/activist band didn’t deserve serious penalties for its actions. Actually, 29 percent believed that the band should have been sent into forced labor, while 37 percent believe they should be imprisoned.

So the Russian government controls the country’s three main television channels, and at the end of 2013, Putin replaced the national news agency with a new and more compliant version. This undermines the free press, of course, but the ugly fact is there doesn’t seem to be much anger about it. In recent years, the Kremlin has imposed limits on protests, criminalized libel, and censored political material on the internet. It has banned the work of nongovernmental organizations (typically aimed at fostering more transparency in government), frozen the assets of human rights groups that receive funding from U.S. citizens, and jailed the political opposition. Occasionally a dissident dies of poisoning.

But the reversal of once promising liberal reforms in Russia is not the result of an undermining of democracy. It happened with the full consent of the electorate. In Russia’s first presidential election, in 2000, Vladimir Putin, who had previously been made prime minister, won 53 percent of the vote. In 2004, he won 71 percent of the vote. In 2008, his lackey Dmitry Medvedev also won in a landslide. In 2012, Putin returned to the presidency in a landslide election with a parliament dominated by members of his party, giving him virtually one party rule.

Sadder still, Putin may be a better choice. It’s not like there democrats with widespread support are waiting in the wings. Remember, it was the Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second place last election with 20 percent of the vote. In a 2009 poll. nearly 60 percent of Russians said they ‘deeply regret’ the Soviet Union’s demise.

Forget the Middle East, where we’ve thankfully stopped pretending democracy is a panacea, and take a closer look at Russia’s neighborhood. In nearby Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, the country’s only president since independence in 1991 and whose rule has seen widespread torture, murder, corruption, press censorship, and roundups of political dissidents, won his last election with 88 percent,10 down from his previous high of 91 percent. In Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev has also been in control since 1991, winning 96 percent of the vote in 2011. Democracy isn’t exactly a competitive enterprise there, as three of Nazarbayev’s opponents endorsed him.

In Politico, Gregory Feifer recently wrote:

But the real glue holding the population to Putin’s regime isn’t rising expectations but the country’s all-encompassing corruption, starting with the daily bribes Russians must pay to traffic police, building inspectors and most other officials with discretionary power.

Obviously, there are barriers to a healthy vote in Russia. And maybe people lie to pollsters. Or maybe most people don’t understand or care very much about liberalism. According to a 2011 Pew Research study of global attitudes about democracy, over 60 percent of Ukrainians and Russians told researchers that they would rather have a strong leader than a democratic government.

Well, they have it now.

The Crimea Crisis And The Abuse Of History,"Every international crisis brings out the amateur historian in pundits and politicians. The Russian seizure of Crimea has been no different, sparking all kinds of analogies and examples, including the inevitable Hitler comparisons. (Yes, Secretary Clinton, you have a point. But it was still over the top, especially coming from America’s former chief diplomat.)

That is not to say that history itself is not useful. Professional historians have much to tell us about the roots of this conflict, as do political analysts, who (like me) see proximate causes for the crisis in recent events, including serious errors in U.S. foreign policy. But facile historical comparisons are only obscuring more than they are clarifying.

Many of these parallels are put forward by people who understand neither the present situation nor the past to which they’re comparing it. Taking an early lead in the competition for the worst way to open an article in this category, a “senior political analyst” at Al Jazeera began a story recently by writing: “Like most of the people speaking about Ukraine, I am no expert. But I know one or two things about the history of the Cold War to recognize…”

As is so often the case, knowing just one or two things is almost always an invitation to later intellectual trouble.

Sometimes, of course, the goal is intentional obfuscation: Russian apologists, for example, rely on flawed comparisons with Kosovo and Iraq as justifications for the Kremlin’s aggression. In America, meanwhile, some partisans, determined to prevent this disaster from staining the Obama administration, invoke George W. Bush’s tepid reaction to the 2008 Russian attack on Georgia as the precedent for Western inaction.

In the end, however, these historical analogies are mostly nonsense, especially when they are used to draw false moral equivalences. There may be precedents to consider in determining our reaction to the Russian invasion, but they are not to be found among clumsy historical fairy tales. So let’s dispense with them right now.

This is not Kosovo in 1999

Crimea, despite the jibe from Putin that Ukraine is “not even a country,” it is not part of a failing state, or on the verge of a genocide. Ukraine is a nation-state that’s just experienced a traumatic change of government, the result of a popular uprising against an increasingly autocratic president who was duly removed by his own parliament (and repudiated by his own party).

The Ukrainian government is not led by people like the late Slobodan Milosevic, whose forces had already butchered thousands in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and were poised to slaughter yet more. Putin would dearly love to draw that equivalence, but the relative calm of the Ukrainian armed forces to the arrival of his thugs – and if they’re liberators, why are they wearing masks? – has flummoxed him and defeated his attempt to create a faked “refugee crisis.”

This is not Iraq in 2003

This is the one that is, of course, particularly offensive to Americans, whose sons and daughters fought and suffered in a war against a pestilent madman who had started two wars with his neighbors, used weapons of mass destruction, conducted attempted genocide against his own people, and thumbed his nose at repeated demands and resolutions from the UN Security Council.

Whether one supported or lamented the war – I went from the former to the latter – what’s going on in Crimea isn’t even vaguely related to the 2003 war against Iraq, which was an outlaw state led by a dictator already guilty of decades of repeated crimes against humanity by the time he was finally deposed.

This is isn’t Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968

These two have a popularity among folks who are misusing history. Some have used them to show continuity in Russian foreign policy – i.e., that Moscow can’t help invading its neighbors, as though it’s in the Russian political DNA – while others have pointed to the feckless Western responses to the Crimean invasion as nothing more than updated versions of the awful situations faced by Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson in those two crises.

First, the invasions of those two nations were not as much “Russian” as they were “Soviet” actions, and there is in fact a difference. They were driven by a deep ideological insecurity that feared any public repudiation of the Soviet Union’s “alliance,” the Warsaw Pact, which was less an alliance than a multi-state prison camp. The same ideological hypochondria pulled the USSR into Afghanistan, even as Soviet leaders knew they were heading into chaos.

Second, it is pure sophistry to argue that President Obama is in the same jam faced by Ike and LBJ. Budapest and Prague, tragically, were theoretically Soviet allies, and during the tense years of the Cold War any attempt to force them from Moscow’s grip would almost instantly have meant World War III. We face no such danger now, unless we or the Russians decide to escalate to a major war that in turn threatens NATO – which, God willing, no one is even thinking of right now.

This isn’t Georgia in 2008

Finally, this is not a re-run of the Georgian war, and there is little in that experience to help us now, although Bush’s national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, did admit that Bush should have punished Putin more for his adventure in Georgia.

The Georgian war was different, however, in that Washington was faced with the awkward problem that the Georgians struck first (although Tbilisi later disputed that finding.) The Georgian leaders were relentlessly baited into an unwise war by the Russians, who had cleverly laid a trap and sprang it the minute the Georgians opened fire. If there is a lesson here, it has already been learned by the Ukrainians, who have wisely – and miraculously – resisted serial Russian provocations.

But the idea that Putin was encouraged by Bush’s “weak” response is nonsense. Putin actually reached out to Bush early in the crisis, a cagey move that left POTUS 43 in a quandary: he couldn’t ask a friendly country to desist in an effort to reclaim its own territory, but the Georgians had blundered ahead without consulting Washington, and Bush could not put NATO on the line for a war it hadn’t started.

It’s also important to remember that it only took a week or so for the Europeans to get Moscow to desist and agree to pull back. Russian troops still occupy parts of Georgia, but the crisis was defused relatively quickly. This time, however, Putin has shown little interest in anything anyone has to say, even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he is on far better terms than President Obama.

In the end, there is no historical justification or analogy for Russian action. Perhaps the closest examples to what we’re seeing now in Crimea are Argentina’s attempted seizure of the Falkland Islands in 1982, or Saddam Hussein’s attempt to erase Kuwait from the map in 1991. In both cases, one state attempted to redrawn disputed borders by sheer force.

The Argentine junta and Saddam both failed in the face of a military response. There is no such action here (and calls for increased military activity in the West are as ridiculous as they are empty). Putin, it seems, will succeed, but that short-term victory does not prefigure Europe’s future. Putin is not Hitler, no more than President Obama and Chancellor Merkel are modern Neville Chamberlains.

This conflict has its roots in a complex history in the region, to be sure, but the situation itself is not nearly that complicated. But if we are to tolerate the invasion of a peaceful state by another, as it seems we must, then at least let us at least not dress up our discomfort in foolish and awkward analogies.

When Will Fox News Recognize Other Views on Foreign Policy?,"I’ve remarked in the past that the decrease of the ability for the right to stand as the adult in the room on foreign policy has had far-reaching effects in the perception of conservative voices on these issues, moreso than those inside the Beltway appreciate. As I see it, the experience coming out of the second Bush term – and in reaction to the aspirations of his second inaugural – undermined the Republican Party’s status as the responsible adult in the room on fiscal and foreign policy. The former led to the rise of the Tea Party, and the latter led to a palpable distrust for anyone who proposes an interventionist strategy, providing a vacuum filled to this point by Rand Paul and now receiving its third major real-world policy challenge in Ukraine – it won in its first, on Syria, and has been fighting through its second, on NSA spying.

Here’s a perfect example of how this adult in the room thesis applies, and why smart Washington types don’t give the appearance of understanding it:

""We have no way of getting Putin out of Crimea - he's not going to leave,"" Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, said. ""I think it's likely that in a week or two, it'll be a part of Russia."" ""We have to reassure NATO that it's going to stop with Ukraine,"" he added. ""What we should do is to announce that any further step of Putin into the rest of Ukraine, we will immediately, favorably consider requests for weapons and trainers on the ground."" ... Krauthammer laid out possible solutions for President Obama to address himself. ""Number one: order the EPA to consider the 24 pending applications for liquid and natural gas exports, and to expedite and have a verdict within six weeks,"" Krauthammer said. ""And second, call an emergency meeting with Republicans in Congress to re-do the defense budget as a way to increase it, rather than cutting it back. That will be a lesson for the long run, and the Russians will be hurt by it.""

Krauthammer is the most prominent intellectual voice on Fox News and his word is often received as the voice of Moses from the mountain. But while I certainly respect his many intelligent offerings, the fact that this policy suggestion went unchallenged on Fox is a telling sign of the positioning of the network and the inside-the-Beltway view of what “Reaganism” demands. Speeding right up to boots on the ground, particularly consultants’ boots, seems a good way to end up with a repeat of this incident in Georgia, where Putin’s troops snagged American humvees and drove off our trainers. A few American consultants are not going to deter Putin from doing anything regarding Ukraine and they may only escalate the situation.

The better factor is appreciating the energy policy reality of what’s going on: Ukraine cannot live without Russian gas (by the way, this isn’t about the EPA, but that’s a side issue). The IMF package in November died in part because they insisted Kiev stop subsidizing it. This is the subtle truth of Rand Paul’s argument about aid: money that flows from American taxpayers to Ukraine right now will not serve to bolster a West-friendly regime, but rather will line the pockets of oligarchs and Gazprom. Putin knows full well that this administration will never scramble to defend a group of consultants to a lackluster military – so all you’ve done by following Krauthammer’s advice, I suspect, is put Americans in harm’s way for no good end. And of course, it’s possible Putin doesn’t actually want to invade the rest of Ukraine – he plays the long influence game, not the short hot war game.

But again, within the right’s media space, the important thing is that Krauthammer’s line went unchallenged on Fox. We should at least have a debate about whether ideas like this are the right ones, and at least be willing to treat the Rand Paul faction with the respect of not flinging their perspective aside as irrelevant the instant they achieve contact with the real world. As the latest WSJ poll indicates, while it is only a faction, it is not an insignificant one:

7 Things Anti-Interventionists Forgot to Tell Putin,"Over the past few weeks, the foreign policy anti-interventionists—a coalition of cynical establishment “realists,” blame-America-first leftists, and libertarian millennials disillusioned by the Iraq War—have given us a lot of excellent advice about the potential costs of getting involved in the conflict over Ukraine, about the dangers of escalation, about the virtue of caution.

Somehow they forgot to tell any of this to Vladimir Putin, who has spent his time assembling a massive buildup of Russian troops, tanks, and helicopters on the Ukrainian border.

Here is a rundown of all the seemingly reasonable advice that apparently hasn’t been transmitted to Vladimir—and why he’s not going to listen to any of it.

1) Leave other countries alone, and they will leave you alone.

Ron Paul, the godfather of the Libertarian anti-interventionists, urged us to listen to Osama bin Laden—who better as an authority on terrorism?—to make the point that the only reason we have to worry about being attacked is because we meddle so much in the affairs of other people. So how come Putin doesn’t grasp that if he leaves Europe alone, they will leave him alone?

Except that’s what they were already doing. Well, they weren’t exactly leaving Russia alone. The Europeans were buying Russia’s oil and gas, and the West’s big financial centers were eagerly helping Russia’s corrupt “oligarchs” find places to stash their money.

The anti-interventionists will tells us, no doubt, that the Russians felt threatened by the economic agreement the European Union was trying to forge with Ukraine. So an invasion and a massive military buildup are required to fend off the threat of expansionist imperialism from…the European Union? You mean the guys with no military budgets, whose most intrusive act of colonialist aggression is to force you to change the names of your cheeses? It’s like mobilizing for war against Canada.

When Vyktor Yanukovich scuttled the trade agreement in November, the European Union responded by…doing nothing. It comes naturally to them. It was Ukrainians who protested, not because of the specifics of the EU deal, but because they saw Yanukovich’s turn toward Moscow as a sign that he intended to establish a dictatorship. And they were right.

Putin isn’t interested in Ukraine because he sees it as any kind of direct threat. He’s interested in Ukraine because he wants his oligarchs to be able to loot it. His big geopolitical program is to assemble a dictators’ club of kleptocracies to surround Russia and insulate it from the influence of more liberal political systems. After all, if millions of ethnic Russians can live in freedom in Ukraine, who knows what they will expect back in Russia? That’s why he can’t leave Ukraine alone.

2) Using military force will damage your standing in the world.

That’s as opposed to President Obama’s policy of withdrawal and retrenchment, which has made America so honored and respected that…Putin is invading Ukraine.

Running roughshod over Ukraine helps Putin keep other Russian satellites in line, and it impresses Russia’s client states—particularly in Damascus, Tehran, and Caracas—that Russia is strong and the West is weak. The point of Putin’s policy is precisely to re-establish Russia’s standing in the world by showing that he can make things happen on the ground against the opposition of the West.

3) Military intervention always becomes a quagmire.

Rand Paul’s initial reaction to the threat of a Russian invasion was to fantasize about Ukrainian students blowing up Russian natural gas pipelines: “A Ukrainian teenager with $200 of explosives and a burning desire to thwart the Russian bear can disrupt a pipeline.”

I hope that if the Russians mount a full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian army will be able to make things very hot for them. Or if they don’t, I suspect that some of the young men who did battle last month in the Euromaidan will put up some resistance. But dressing up in adapted hockey gear to take on riot police is one thing. Taking on tanks and helicopters is quite another. For all the romanticized mythology about the elusive insurgent who turns an evil empire’s invasion into a quagmire, the fact is that most insurgents lose. Ask the guy who flattened Grozny.

And we haven’t heard of any effective resistance to the Russian occupation of Crimea, perhaps because the Crimean Tatars are terrified of a repeat of their murderous deportation under Stalin.

Senator Paul muses, “Surely, though, some among the renewed nationalists of Moscow must remember the Mujahedin?” Does Senator Paul remember what happened in Afghanistan? It became a quagmire for the Russians largely because we poured in huge amounts of money, arms, training, and military intelligence to support the insurgents (at some cost to us later on). It was one of the biggest interventions, short of war, in America’s history. So this isn’t a story about the failure of Russia’s intervention. It’s a story about the success of our counter-intervention.

4) The public won’t support it.

The Russian public apparently does. Putin escalated the conflict in Ukraine partly to prop up his approval at home, based on the expectation that appealing to jingoistic Russian nationalism works. And it does.

You might object that this approval is artificial, bolstered by Putin’s control of the media. But that’s just the point. If the Russian-owned network RT America is a propaganda outfit, imagine what the press back in Russia is like. Putin has suffocated opposition parties and prosecuted any potential rivals on trumped up corruption charges. He has used the Ukraine crisis as an excuse to shut down his political opponents outright, putting them under house arrest and blocking their websites.

So no, I don’t think Putin is going to be stopped by political opposition at home, not any time soon. Shutting down the opposition is part of the point of the conflict in Ukraine.

5) It’s going to bankrupt your economy.

Certainly, increased tensions with the West will hurt Russia. But Putin is betting that the Europeans won’t have the nerve to impose sanctions, especially if they listen to the Western anti-interventionists. And if the economy sags, do Putin and his cronies ultimately care? Reflect that the per capita annual GDP in Ukraine is about $4,000, yet Vyktor Yanukovich built himself a lavish mansion, and another one, and who knows how many more.

There’s a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela—shades of the old Soviet Union—yet the Chavistas merely tighten their grip.

Worrying about the economy reflects our values and our political system. But dictators have never shown any qualms about living in opulence while the people starve.

6) The Cold War is over.

Not for Putin it isn’t. He clearly believes that the only reason the Soviets lost the Cold War is because the pansies who were in charge lacked the will to crack down on Eastern Europe and the breakaway Soviet republics. If only the Soviet Union in 1985 had had a truly strong leader, a manly man, someone with the courage to be photographed with his shirt off. So Putin wants a do-over.

I’m old enough to remember the final years of the Cold War, and guess what? It’s back. I’m not at all happy about that, and I really wish the Leader of the Free World would do something about it. But don’t worry, Joe Biden is on the job.

This new Cold War is not like the old one. It’s only Cold War Lite, because Russia no longer controls former satellites like Poland and former imperial possessions like Ukraine and the Baltic states. Yet that’s precisely what Putin is trying to change.

7) It’s better to lead by the power of your example.

Actually, Putin knows this one—and that’s what should terrify us.

He’s trying to set an example of how to successfully re-establish a dictatorship, rebuild an empire, defy the West, and restore Russia’s status as a superpower equal to or stronger than the United States. He’s setting an example that he expects his admirers and client states across the world to follow, from Iran to Venezuela. And he’s looking to add a few more clients, maybe in Cairo. Which will mean a world of new trouble for the United States.

This is not to deny that Putin’s Ukraine adventure will run into many problems. His dream of a reborn Russian empire is ultimately a delusion that cannot be maintained. But so was the Soviet dream of world domination, and recall how much damage it caused before it faltered. Also recall that the Soviet Union was brought down, not by passive anti-interventionism, but by a global strategy of counter-interventions, most of them short of war, that blocked Soviet expansion and eventually undermined its power.

This is the fundamental naiveté of the anti-interventionists. They offer excellent advice, just not to the people who need it. You might call this the paradox of pacifism: the reasonable counsels of peace find their most eager audience among those who least need to hear them, while being ignored by the fanatics and strongmen who actually drive most of the world’s conflicts.

So all of this advice just ends up restraining the good guys and letting the bad guys run wild—until we are forced into a much bigger intervention in the future.

War Is the Health of Putin’s State,"There’s an old saying that “war is the health of the state.” Though it was coined by an anti-war leftist during World War I, it has since taken on a certain currency among libertarians. And there is a lot of truth to it.

Historically, war has served as a ready excuse for bigger government spending, more debt, and more economic controls, all in the name of supporting the war effort. Even worse are the cultural effects. Private citizens have been conscripted and made to live under the regimented unity of military or paramilitary organizations. Above all, civil liberties have been curtailed and criticism of the government has been treated as tantamount to treason.

I can’t help pointing out that in America, this best describes the wartime administrations of the two great heroes of the “progressive” left—Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. War is a lot healthier for the state when the commander-in-chief is already looking for an excuse to expand government power.

But while this is used as a slogan by anti-interventionists, it’s worth observing which state is thriving most during the current crisis in Ukraine: the Putin regime in Russia.

War is definitely the health of Putin’s state.

We’ve been focused on Putin’s ambitions abroad, his attempt to reconstitute a neo-Soviet sphere of influence anchored by the Eurasian Union. But his invasion of Ukraine has given Putin the opportunity to reshape the Russian state at home. He had been slowly moving his country toward authoritarian dictatorship, with only the show and outward forms of representative government, and this crisis has allowed him to go the rest of the way.

Following his previous appeals to a narrow traditionalist conservatism—bashing gays and courting the Russian Orthodox establishment—Putin’s appeal to a jingoistic Russian nationalism has been widely popular.

It’s become something of a mantra in Moscow to say that Russians are so pleased with the way their macho leader is “standing up to the West” and “defending compatriots abroad” that they are prepared “to forgive him everything”—from widespread poverty to endemic corruption and police brutality.

To be sure, some Russians don’t approve and a brave core of the opposition has rallied against the war. And much of Putin’s support is artificially maintained by his use of state-controlled media to shut out all contrary views. Consider the upside-down reporting in the Russian press on a deadly pro-Russian riot in the Eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Bystanders and Western reporters recorded video that clearly shows pro-Russian protesters attacking a pro-Ukraine rally and viciously beating the Ukrainians, one of whom died. Yet the incident was reported in the Russian media as an attack by the Ukrainian protesters against the Russians. We are back to the “black is white” propaganda of the Soviet era.

Here is how Putin has used the Ukraine crisis as a way to consolidate his dictatorship.

First, he has shut down the last significant vestiges of a free press. The last non-Kremlin controlled television news channel, Dozhd, has been squeezed out of business, and the editor-in-chief of one of the last independent news websites was replaced with a Kremlin loyalist.

Second, he has shut down the last of his independent political opponents, like Alexei Navalny, who is under house arrest, and Garry Kasparov, whose website has been blocked in Russia along with Navalny’s and several others.

He has consolidated a state-backed cultural elite, on the old Soviet model of “writer’s congresses” and the like, who have been deployed to issue approving statements in favor of Putin.

He has narrowed the leadership in the Kremlin to a core of former KGB men, cutting out the “technocrats” who favored greater integration with the West.

Putin has been cutting his economy off from the West, which sanctions will accelerate. This makes Russia’s “oligarchs,” its clique of politically connected billionaires, more dependent on Putin than on trade with Europe or the U.S.

War, it seems, is healthier for some states than others. And that is very relevant for the question of why we should care about Ukraine and whether American interests are at stake.

To the extent Putin succeeds in bringing Ukraine under the Russian boot, and to the extent the Western response is weak, appeasing, and ineffectual, it supports Putin’s image at home as the shirtless manly-man nationalist hero. Which, in turn, helps him consolidate his dictatorship. But having built his dictatorship on the basis of jingoistic nationalism, he will need to prop it up, from time to time, with further military adventures and foreign policy brinksmanship. So we get a whole new Cold War to deal with.

To the extent that we thwart Putin in Ukraine—humiliate him, even, as I have suggested—we suck the wind out of his attempt to re-establish Russian dictatorship. If nothing succeeds like success, nothing fails like failure. So we have a strong interest in Putin’s failure—and good reasons to help bring it about.

Foreign Policy And The Road From Etchasketchistan,"This is Part 1 of a four-part series.

American foreign policy is currently languishing in a netherworld of indeterminacy that goes by the name of Etchasketchistan.

I borrowed that from a one-line fake headline gag in The Onion: “Earthquake Wipes Out Etchasketchistan.” It’s a pretty good metaphor to describe the breaking point in foreign policy caused last year by President Obama’s abortive proposal to bomb Syria. Here is how I described it at the time.

The Syrian intervention has finally shaken loose all of the foreign policy alignments that fell into place during the Iraq War, and it’s as if someone grabbed the foreign-policy commentariat, turned it upside-down, and shook it so we can start all over again from a blank slate. You can no longer guess where anyone on the left or the right will stand, or who will come off sounding like a realist, a neocon, an isolationist.

The ironies were pretty stark. The debate over Syria pitted “skeptical anti-war Republicans” against “hot-headed neocon warmonger Democrats.” It was as if “everyone has decided to switch sides since the last go-around, just to keep things interesting.”

And now the Etch-a-Sketch has gotten another big shake. Just as folks on the right were starting to settle in to their new anti-war attitude, along comes Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to remind them that they’re supposed to be hawks. After all, standing up to the Russkis somehow feels comfortable, familiar. It’s what Reagan would have wanted us to do.

American foreign policy is adrift and unaligned, with everyone simply reacting to events ad hoc. There is no direction, strategy, or overarching principle.

A foreign policy shaped by events is not as big a disaster as it might seem, because foreign policy always involves judgments about the specific circumstances of specific threats and opportunities. For long periods, American foreign policy has had one overarching threat or event to give our policy a long-term framework. After World War II, the Soviet Union emerged as the world’s biggest threat. So for forty years, foreign policy was always about the same basic question: how do we oppose Communism? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the question was: how do we capitalize on this opportunity to pursue peace and trade with more of the world? For about ten years after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the basic question was: how do we oppose radical Islamists? (While that question remains, it has been considerably muddled by the aftermath of the Arab Spring.) You could say that during each of these periods we were reacting to events, but there was some one big event that provided a framework and gave a degree of long-term stability to our foreign policy.

Today, we don’t have a framework, and we’re just getting whipsawed by events.

We need to take advantage of this Etch-a-Sketch moment to pull back, look at the big picture, and rebuild a foreign policy consensus for the right by going back to basic, pro-liberty principles.

Sitting Out the Last War

But first, there is a big obstacle to get out of the way. A new consensus is trying to establish itself on the right, one that is reflexively anti-war and anti-intervention. Ayn Rand once argued against the use of the term “isolationist” as a smear—but boy is it tempting to use it against some on the right who it seem like they have never found a vigorous foreign policy action they could support.

Partly, this is a consequence of the rising influence of the libertarian wing of the right, which has a long history of borrowing its foreign policy from the blame-America-first anti-war left. The situation in Ukraine has served as a reminder of the bizarre and destructive stance of the Ron Paul libertarians. This is a guy who quit the Republican Party partly in protest over Reagan’s opposition to the Soviets, and who is backing Vladimir Putin in the current conflict. Does anyone else find it strange to find a libertarian who is so comfortable with dictatorships?

But the issue is wider than the Paulite influence. There is a whole group of disillusioned conservatives who are still politically shell-shocked from the war in Iraq.

This is a variation on the old phenomenon of fighting the last war—responding today with whatever you wished you done last time around, whether it’s appropriate or not. The most famous example is the Maginot Line, an impregnable defense against the kind of trench warfare the Germans used against France in World War I—which turned out to be useless against the new mechanized maneuver warfare of the blitzkrieg.

The difference this time is that it’s not about how the last war was fought, but about whether it was fought. There are many on the right who wish, in retrospect, that we had sat out Iraq. So now they’re determined to sit out whatever happens next.

Vietnam Syndrome Lite

If we’re living through 20th Century Lite—a re-enactment, in miniature, of all the errors of the last century—then this is Vietnam Syndrome Lite. The failure in Vietnam (which was not a failure on the battlefield, just as Iraq wasn’t) was used to pound in the idea that the US should never do anything like that ever again. It made us gun shy when it came to using our military power, because we assumed that any intervention would just end up being a quagmire. Does any of that sound familiar? We only overcame the Vietnam Syndrome after two things happened. First, events spun so far out of control at the end of Jimmy Carter’s administration that it became clear the US had to become more assertive again. Second, we managed to produce a few conspicuous examples of American military success—most notably the Gulf War in 1991—that gave us our confidence back.

How can we overcome our current reprisal of the Vietnam Syndrome? Unfortunately, I don’t think we can argue our way out of it. I suspect it’s going to take some big event—bigger than the current crisis in Ukraine—to shake us out of our lethargy. But we can prepare the ground by examining three basic arguments made by the anti-interventionists: appeals to the expense of American action, to the difficulties in executing it properly, and to a greatly constricted conception of American interests.

Let’s start with the expense of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The fact is that these are small wars, both in terms of money and lives. The cost is great, of course, for the individuals who bear it, for those who have been injured and for the families of those who have died. But until or unless we can get drones to do all of our fighting for us (a strategy that has disadvantages of its own), all wars will result in the death and maiming of service members, and most wars have had a far greater cost. Iraq and Afghanistan put together cost less than half as much money relative to GDP (which is the appropriate measure) as Vietnam, and less than one twentieth as much as World War II. The difference in the cost in lives is even starker. The war in Iraq cost about 4,500 American lives—less than one tenth the cost of Vietnam, and almost one one-hundredth the cost of World War II. So if Iraq was “too costly,” how could any other conflict be justified? To oppose even these relatively small wars on the basis of their cost is, in effect, to oppose war as such.

And after all, war is not bankrupting the nation. There are plenty of other things that are bankrupting the republic: bailouts, stimulus, and above all else, the vast entitlement state. But defense spending is relatively low by historical standards, and positively tiny as a percentage of federal spending. As recently as the 1950s, the federal budget was about 80% defense spending and 20% everything else. If we had that same ratio today, the federal budget would be no more than $1 trillion total, giving us a massive surplus that would allow us to rapidly pay down the debt. So please don’t repeat the anti-war talking point about how defense spending is bankrupting the nation. No, it’s everything else that’s bankrupting us.

Similar complaints have been made about the poor execution of the war. One veteran comments:

Speaking for a not-insignificant number of veterans of the last dozen years of war, may I raise a point of order? Before we go too far down the road of discussing whether and how interventionist we shall be, can we at least discuss how much we failed in the execution phase of the last round of interventions? A philosophy of muscular engagement fails when the execution of that engagement is—how shall I put this charitably?—lacking.

This has led to a common view on the right—a way to square the circle of the right’s hawkish legacy and its present anti-interventionist mood—that they would favor intervention, if only we would use enough force and do it right.

I respect this outlook, and certainly a legitimate complaint about some of President Obama’s proposed interventions, from Afghanistan to Libya to Syria, is that they are so half-hearted that we are likely to experience significant cost without any benefit.

But then again, when have soldiers ever returned from a war and thought, “Well, that went perfectly.” The history of war is a history of blunders. All too often, a single such mistake has cost as many lives in a day as the entire wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over ten years. And even the most brilliant commanders have made them.

Remember that previous conflicts have given us the phrase “SNAFU” to remind us what the “normal situation” of war is.

To all of these arguments, let us add one other important observation: “intervention” is not synonymous with “war.” In fact, most foreign policy interventions are diplomatic and economic. Some consist of offering indirect military assistance—training, weapons, supplies, intelligence—or just offering moral support. Certainly, most of what we did to oppose the Soviets during the Cold War was not fighting.

I don’t think we can explain the current weariness with intervention by reference to the actual material costs of last decade’s efforts. No, I’m afraid to say that the biggest cost that has propelled the right’s disillusionment is the political cost. Most people on the right are not weary of the casualties or the wartime privation (which most of us have not experienced). No, they’re bruised by having lost a couple of elections, they’re seared by the memory of having to defend the war in Iraq when things were clearly going badly and all their liberal friends were gloating. They’re weary of the mere psychological and intellectual “cost” of having to care about what happens in parts of the world that they don’t particularly like.

Well, suck it up. Were you on the battlefield? Are you on the battlefield now? No? Then you don’t have permission to be tired.

What Went Wrong?

But hasn’t “intervention” been tried and failed? I think we can all agree that our foreign policy is in pretty bad shape right now, about as bad as it has ever been. Heck, the Russians are openly making snide jokes about how President Obama must be a secret KGB recruit. They can’t believe their luck in having such a patsy in the White House.

I’m pretty sure this is worse than Jimmy Carter.

So what was the Obama foreign policy theory that went wrong? Liberal idealism? No, not when Samantha Power, who made her name advocating for humanitarian intervention to stop genocide, is part of a foreign policy team that ignores massacres and deliberate starvation in Syria and seems peculiarly indifferent to human rights. So then is the Obama policy hard-nosed, unsentimental “realism”? Try not to laugh. After all, what’s realistic about Obama’s assessment of the world? Moreover, the “realist” school is fundamentally concerned with stabilizing the international system by preserving the world’s balance of power, something Obama has obviously failed to do. Obama’s policy certainly isn’t “neoconservative” democracy-promotion. From Iran to Egypt, his stance on this issue has run the gamut from indifferent to ambivalent.

No, only one theory explains Obama’s policy, and that is: anti-interventionism. We know that Obama was brought up on the ideas of the anti-American far left, which views American “imperialism” as the cause of the world’s problems. We know that he came into office openly vowing, in his 2009 speech in Cairo, to make America less important and less exceptional in world affairs. I think we can admit that this mission has been accomplished,

President Obama has offered a few sops to existing policies, such as his half-hearted “surge” in Afghanistan, but it was accompanied by an announcement of his intended withdrawal. He not only withdrew troops from Iraq but also proceeded to disengage US diplomats, pretty much ending US influence there. His only major military intervention has been in Libya, but he was only “leading from behind” after Britain and France demanded action. He then immediately forgot about Libya, leaving our ambassador vulnerable to attack. His most controversial tactics—drone strikes, special forces raids, and global wiretapping—were pursued as low-cost substitutes for bigger interventions. His response to the three-way power struggle in Egypt between Islamists, liberals, and the old regime can be summed up as: “let me know who wins.” Hint: it wasn’t the liberals. His diplomacy—in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine—has shown a fondness for “offramp” deals, whose purpose is not to achieve an important American goal but to take the problem off of our plate.

We’ll have to examine what went wrong with the Bush administration’s interventionist policies, too. But the Obama administration can be taken as a pretty good test for what it looks like when an administration seeks to reduce and avoid American intervention in the world. We can see the results, and they are far from reassuring.

So what is the alternative we should embrace? I don’t necessarily expect to find a bipartisan foreign policy consensus. That is unrealistic, certainly in the short term. After all, the political parties exist to offer ideological alternatives on the big issues of the day. But it would be helpful if we could reach some degree of agreement on the right—and do it, say, sometime before the Republican National Convention in 2016. On the road from Etchasketchistan, it would be helpful if we could get Rand Paul and Marco Rubio riding on the same camel.

Of the anti-interventionist arguments, the only substantial one that remains is the question of whether intervention overseas is in America’s “interests,” a term the libertarian anti-interventionists generally define to mean “not anything overseas.” It is a passive, defensive conception of American interests; in effect, our only interest is not to be noticed and to be left alone. We will analyze, in later installments, how realistic that is. But the question about the nature and scope of American interests is a legitimate one.

If we’re going to chart the road back from Etchasketchistan, a journey that will carry us out of the miniature malaise of our new Vietnam Syndrome, then let’s start by defining and clarifying the interests that are the proper concern of American foreign policy.

This series will be continued.

Rand Paul Just Missed An Opportunity To Prove He Isn’t Ron Paul,"The conventional wisdom has spoken. Rand Paul is on the rise.

The Kentucky Senator has won two presidential straw polls in as many weeks. He came out on top in a brand-new CNN/ORC International poll of Republican 2016 hopefuls, and the small detail that his narrow lead fell entirely within the suvey’s sampling error didn’t stop the media from marveling at his early momentum. From HBO to “Morning Joe,” the libertarian darling has the chattering class abuzz with talk of his political promise.

The praise is coming Paul’s way for good reason. Though he has yet to completely kick his awkward delivery to the curb, the Senator’s speaking has improved dramatically since his 2010 election. With every interview and public appearance, he has steadily become a more forceful and articulate spokesman for an important subset of American principles that have received far too little attention in Washington for far too long. Marry this personal progress with the IRS, the NSA, and the other Obama-era scandals seemingly tailor-made for libertarian critique, and his rise to prominence is easy to understand. The Senator has molded himself into an impressive political athlete just as a series of high-profile matches have been held in his home court.

But the plaudits nearly always come with a catch. Whether in syndicated columns or casual conversations, applause for Paul is frequently followed up with the same cautionary suffix: But he needs to prove that he isn’t just his father.

The younger Paul needs to be libertarian enough, in other words, but not too libertarian. We constantly hear that the Senator needs to forge and walk a middle path that must be both distinct enough from typical Republicanism to be refreshing and mainstream enough to disassociate Paul’s brand from the paranoid, parochial, paleoconservative vibe that left most ordinary Americans unable to envision his father in the White House.

This narrative is especially prominent when the conversation turns to foreign affairs. Many on the right find much to like in libertarians’ back-to-basics vision for domestic policy, but the premise that America’s actions overseas do more harm than good still clashes badly with the assertive patriotism that has helped define the GOP for more than half a century. Conservatives will hear out differing perspectives on the size and scope of social programs, but anyone who even appears to suggest that foreign anti-Americanism may be the justifiable fruit of our own meddlesome ways is instantly extinguished as an option in the minds of many voters.

Now, this pitfall can certainly be avoided. After all, our current President was himself an ideologically pure Senator who struck many as too dovish. He surmounted this obstacles by very deliberately pouncing on opportunities to burnish his credentials, strategically feinting right on specific global issues to reassure the average voter that he could be a well-informed and tough leader too. In purely political terms, if Paul is to cement his status as a major player and conclusively separate himself from the fringe, he must find opportunities to repeat Obama’s feat.

That means seizing opportunities to appear resolute but not reckless. Opportunities to display tenacity and remind Republican voters that there many ways to tackle a crisis overseas that fall in between the equally unpopular poles of embarrassing inaction and full-bore intervention. Opportunities that allow the Senator to ding a Democratic President for looking weak while keeping his voice clearly distinct from his party’s more typical hawks.

Opportunities exactly like the recent chaos in Ukraine.

Yes, the evolving chess match between the United States and Russia offered Paul a massive opening. The crisis oozes with precisely the kind of old-school power politics that Paul vocally argues America has come to neglect. Still war-weary but also anxious of taking a geopolitical backseat, the American people seem to recognize that neither the “Bush model” nor the “Obama model, as they see them, are really what this situation calls for. In other words, the nation craves a Ukraine response aligned with the very via media that Paul has worked for years to elaborate: assertive but not arrogant, both clear-eyed and steel-spined.

The Senator has spent years charging leaders on both sides with inattention to nuance and pining for the days when hard-nosed realists took a fresh, analytical, and detail-driven look at situations as they arose. In early 2013, Paul opened a foreign policy speech by declaring that “foreign policy is uniquely an arena where we should base decisions on the landscape of the world as it is [and] not as we wish it to be…I am a realist, not a neoconservative, nor an isolationist.”

In this area, ironically enough, the libertarian hero casts himself as a technocrat. Paul lauds pragmatism, disdains blind principle, and portrays himself as the man who will set aside preconceptions and dive straight into the details of foreign policy. And in a geopolitical crisis that so obviously demands an American response but where a dramatic show of force is equally obviously off the table, sober technocracy is what we need.

So the structure of this crisis teed up an ideal opportunity for Paul to score real points. But as commentators across the political spectrum have demonstrated, that chance vanished when the Senator began to speak. Blogging at New York Magazine and National Review respectively, Jon Chait and Patrick Brennan offer two of the most thorough excoriations of Paul’s half-baked proposals. One of the Senator’s action items had already been executed before his articles were published, for example; others would have been directly counterproductive and actively harmed American interests.

I won’t pretend to add value by replicating other commentators’ takedowns. I will simply observe that zero prominent voices of any ideological persuasion have come forward to argue that Paul nailed the specifics on this.

And on a broader level, Paul’s TIME op-ed is problematic because it commits the very same sin for which he lambastes other politicians: reasoning down from one’s own a priori commitments instead of letting the specifics of a situation speak for themselves. The Senator rapidly pivots away from a Ukraine-specific conversation into his signature talking points, the moral and financial limits that should constrain government action. These are doubtless important considerations, but acknowledging these limits is only the beginning of an intelligent conversation about foreign policy, not its conclusion.

When the Russian rubber hit the road, Paul seems to have discovered that talking about intelligently using all the facets of American power is easier than actually proposing a plan of action. Faced with complicated facts, he retreated just as quickly as everyone he criticizes into the comfort zone of his own philosophical priors.

It is thanks to those very priors that Rand Paul will have a tougher time passing the “Commander-in-Chief test” than any other Republican who shares his aspirations. Where domestic policy is concerned, the President merely supervises and constrains a process that Congress primarily drives, so it is very conceivable that GOP voters would see a libertarian chief executive as a useful check on the legislature. But in foreign affairs, it is the White House from which energy, imagination, and action itself must flow.

The man (or woman) who ultimately commands America’s global presence cannot simply be an expert in what our country cannot and should not do. He cannot merely be a specialist in constraints, an enforcer of limitations, an expert at cordoning off the negative space into which government ought not tread. He or she must also be comfortable filling that void—setting goals, developing plans, implementing substantive policies, and reasoning through complicated strategies in times of acute crisis.

On the home front, a President whose specialty is operating the brakes might be a welcome development. But on the world stage, the job also requires knowing when and how to step on the gas, to fill the void with a vision and put it into practice.

That is a role that Americans will be naturally skeptical a libertarian can fill, and Paul’s recent foibles highlight exactly why. The next time the Senator is asked to weigh in on world affairs, his supporters can only hope he begins to take his own advice.

Vladimir Putin Is Not The President Of Sim City,"Are you deeply interested in what’s going on in the current crisis between Russia and Ukraine right now, but don’t know much about either Russia or Ukraine? Do you want to get involved in prognosticating what’s going to happen, but don’t want to bother with the tedium of studying Russian and Soviet history, or the interminable drudgery of learning the Russian or Ukrainian languages?

Not to worry. Famous economist Daniel Altman has a solution for you. It’s called game theory, and it explains everything you need to know, without having to know… well, anything, really. Let me say at the outset, I do not know Dr. Altman, and I have no personal issue with him or his body of work as an economist. (He is big, apparently, in international development and globalization circles.) Indeed, I do not work in his field at all, and I am not qualified to judge it. He has gained my attention, however, by working in my field, and doing it poorly.

Altman’s argument is that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a master of game theory. He’s so good at it, in fact, that he’s already won the game he’s playing over Ukraine and we clueless Westerners don’t even know it yet. “Reasoning,” Altman tells us in a recent Foreign Policy article, is Putin’s “strong suit,” and the West “could learn a lot from him.” Putin, he thinks, is working from a set of internal rules that game theorists would recognize, and unless we get up to speed pronto, he’s going to keep taking us to the cleaners. (The idea that Putin is simply running the table against an overmatched and disengaged United States foreign policy team doesn’t enter into any of this, apparently. That explanation doesn’t fit the theory – and isn’t usually bruited about in polite academic conversation.)

Now, to people unencumbered by higher education or formal training in the social sciences, this might all seem silly. Who can divine the behavior of nations, and especially of mercurial leaders like Vladimir Putin, from models? Would anyone actually rely on that kind of analysis? (Sadly, the answer is yes, and some even pay for it quite handsomely, as it turns out. Just ask political scientist Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, who sells the results of an algorithm that predicts all kinds of stuff – a secret and proprietary formula, of course – to business and government for big bucks.)

For those who’ve never sat through a university department meeting or been trapped in the hell of a mediocre academic conference, here’s how this kind of intellectual painting-by-the-numbers works.

First, start with a model or a theory. In this case, it’s game theory, the idea that human beings are reducible (as in some cases they are) to little robots that maximize gain and minimize loss. If you’ve ever played the classic computer game SimCity, you’ve already engaged in a nicely rendered version of game theory: the little citizens, the Sims, act in predictable ways that you, as the mayor of SimCity, can shape with policy choices. Raise taxes or let crime go up, your Sims move away. Lower taxes and provide better public services, and your Sims will make cute little parks and churches and have babies.

Next – and this is key – don’t allow the model to be contaminated by pesky stuff like evidence. It just gets in the way. If a closer look at events and actors produces complexities that can’t be explained, change the scale of the theory to a higher level of abstraction so you can ignore them. (Remember: from a high enough altitude, Massachusetts and California look alike.) And keep it simple: the less specificity, the better.

Altman, accordingly, claims that Putin’s actions reflect “a simple three-step process designed to guarantee success” that “come right out of a game theory textbook.” The rest of us might call them “common sense,” but let’s take a closer look.

Overestimating Putin’s Savvy

First, Putin is making sure to “locate the opportunity.” Putin, Altman tells us, “only plays games that he knows he can win. Like a game theorist, he looks at his possible moves and the moves of his opponents.” This, I guess, is supposed to fly in the face of conventional wisdom about how the rest of us do things, which is…what? That we prefer the games we’re not good at, and then play as though there is no opponent? (“Okay, men, I know you’re all scrabble champs, but take this football out on the field at the 30-yard line, and just play. If there’s another team, we can’t spend a lot of time worrying about what they’re gonna do.”) As long as Putin isn’t a complete idiot, anything he does fits this “rule.”

Next, Altman notes that Putin is applying the maxim that one must “change the status quo.” If Putin doesn’t act, Altman writes, “then the world will go on its merry way, which is not what he wants.” He’s arguing that Putin’s Russia is no longer a status quo power; that is, one satisfied with the nature of the current international order. Fair enough, although I and millions of Ukrainians had already reached that conclusion. But the notion that any world leader is ever content to have the world “go on its merry way” is a ridiculous abstraction. No one, whether running a government or a household, acts that way. Altman is only telling us that Putin is trying as best he can to shape his environment to his advantage, just as you and I, unskilled in the mysteries of game theory, do every month when we pay our bills.

And then there’s this: Putin knows he must “force the opponents to accept the new status quo.” Altman then delivers a Deep Revelation, which will surprise exactly no one: “Putin’s favorite kind of opponent is the one who accepts losing, thus confirming the change he desires. In order to ensure that his opponent accepts the loss, Putin must make any other reaction less desirable.”

Let’s just ponder that. Putin, apparently, is far savvier than the rest of us, in that he likes to play games against people who don’t mind losing. Unlike, say, you or me, who obviously prefer really tough, die-hard opponents who never accept a loss. And he has a point: who hasn’t enjoyed a good game of poker with the fellow who always upends the table at the end of the night, scatters all the chips, and demands all his money back? We all love that guy. We’d much rather play with him than with the cheerful loser who settles up and then quietly skulks out of the room with empty pockets.

All of Altman’s elegant restatements of common sense might serve as a useful heuristic to simplify Putin’s actions if there were some kind of evidence to support his explanations. Instead, Altman’s evidence is the worst kind there is: the tautological use of the outcome of the Crimean crisis itself. Instead of basing his argument on things we might have learned about Putin or the Russian decision-making process, Altman instead merely reverse-engineers conclusions based on what he knows has already happened to prove that Putin knew what he was doing all along. (The fact that the crisis isn’t over yet is, apparently, of no concern.)

This is a serious intellectual error, and surely Altman knows it. It is the equivalent of arguing that because you left your home one morning in Boston and ended up in Philadelphia that night, it must be because Philly is where you meant to go all along. While that might make a logical first pass at an explanation, it makes no provision for any other events, like getting lost, cutting the trip short, or a flat tire. If a leader ends up with a certain outcome, it must have been the one he wanted, because that’s what happened, and all that’s left is to reconstruct the obviously logical and conscious choices that got him there.

Altman’s analysis on this point worth is reading at length, to see just how hard he hammers a big, square peg into a tiny, round hole:

Putin’s actions in Ukraine are a case in point. His overarching goals are to enhance Russian power and push back the West by expanding his spheres of control and influence. His preference might have been to do this in Ukraine peacefully and across the country as a whole, but he was also willing to use violence and take what was available piecemeal.

Note how this carefully covers all of Putin’s possible actions. If he gained Ukraine peacefully, that was his goal. But if he had to use violence…well, that could have been his goal, too.

Altman continues:

Here is how he may have seen the game play out late last year. First, he would offer a package of financial aid to Ukraine. He knew his ally, the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, would accept. If all was well thereafter, mission accomplished — Ukraine would once again be Russia’s client state. If all was not well — that is, if there were political upheaval, protests, unrest, or all three — then the country would be unstable. And an unstable Ukraine would be ripe for the picking, especially since parts of it were strongly sympathetic to Russia. If Ukraine did become unstable, then Putin’s next move would be to invade Crimea and somehow legitimize its return to Russia. This would be the first step in a piecemeal recovery of power over Ukraine. Achieving the change itself would not be difficult. But he would also have to force his opponents to accept it.

Get that? We know Putin is successfully applying game theory because Altman can posit each of his steps as being intentional, because Putin has clearly succeeded, and this success itself is evidence that he’s doing things according to the game theory playbook. Putin had a plan to “somehow legitimize” the seizure of Crimea, and we know this because so far, the seizure of Crimea has been “somehow legitimized.” This is purely circular reasoning.

It is also pure nonsense. The fact of the matter is that Altman has no idea whether anything he is positing is true. He has no way of knowing, and presents no evidence at all, about whether any of this was a plan, whether it was improvisation, or just (at least so far) sheer good luck. Altman’s evidence for his whole case is that so far, things are working out for Putin, and from this, he draws the conclusion that Putin is playing his own version of a careful application of classic game theory. Unless Altman’s had a recent chat with Putin we don’t know about, this amounts to nothing more than guessing.

Game Theory or Petty Revenge?

This is the kind of theorizing that is best facilitated by not knowing too much about the subject. I and others could just as well argue (and have) that Putin is, in fact, acting irrationally because he is risking things he had already gained. Indeed, leave aside the straitjacket of formal theory, learn a bit about the actual historical and political situation in the region, and Putin’s actions can just as easily – if not more so – be explained as those of a vengeful, petty product of the Soviet system than those of a careful game player.

Why? Because Putin could have “won” this crisis by never starting it. Over the course of a decade, especially once the Orange Revolution was defeated, Putin had gotten just about everything he wanted from Ukraine, including a leader in Kyiv who practically had “Property of the Kremlin” stamped on his forehead. Putin’s attempt to force the Russia-or-Europe choice down Yanukovich’s throat (which apparently actually happened in an expletive-filled dressing down Putin gave him in Moscow) was irrational overreach by the Russian President that provoked the Euromaidan movement – exactly the reaction Putin didn’t want. By some reports, Putin was genuinely taken aback, then surprised, and finally enraged by Yanukovich’s ouster, and he reacted with visceral anger, setting in motion events whose end are nowhere in sight even for Putin himself. The Russian invasion of Crimea is now endangering things Putin values – like Russian economic stability purely so he claim something – a base and a military presence in Crimea – he already had.

Not content to reduce Putin to the President of SimCity, Altman packages up some lessons for the rest of us. “Assess vulnerabilities, both present and potential,” he suggests – for those of us, of course, to whom it has never occurred to do risk analysis – because “the games Putin will play are not always readily apparent. Ukraine was not obviously unstable, but Putin had the foresight to see how it might become destabilized.”

Excuse me? Ukraine was not obviously unstable? Perhaps it could seem that way if viewed from outer space, but to anyone who’s spent more than a few minutes studying the former Soviet region, Ukraine was the most unstable place in Europe outside of the former Yugoslavia. A Ukrainian civil war has been worrying all of us who study this area and has been a constant fear among specialists in this subject ever since the Soviet collapse. This is a classic moment where theory is invaluably aided by steering clear of any kind of contact with reality.

Next: “Learn about your opponent’s objectives.” Indeed. How often those of us who write and lecture on strategy have foolishly told our students: “Ignore your opponent and his goals.” But now we’ve been set straight.

Altman predicts, by the way, that “Putin’s remaining moves are fairly straightforward” and that he will not invade eastern Ukraine. Instead, “he will finally appear to listen to reason” and “disown the pro-Russian forces there (whose actions he instigated), while privately reassuring them of his support and explaining that it was not the right time for further action.”

I suppose all of that is possible, although I can think of a lot of reasons Putin won’t invade Ukraine’s east that have nothing to do with game theory and have everything to do with him not being completely crazy and reckless. And if he does invade, I’m sure Altman will have an explanation about why this really fits the theory, because the incentive structures were changed, and Putin saw new payoff expectations, and…well, you get the idea. It’s not that hard to drown a bad prediction in a swamp of theory always teeming with analytical leeches that can drain any meaning from any outcome.

In the end, this is the kind of analysis that gives academic theory a bad name. Theory, when used as a tool instead of pursued as an end itself, does actually serve a purpose. It helps to make order out of random bits of data, and to allow us organize the chaos of events into coherent sets of relationships and explanations. Unfortunately, over the years academic theory has devolved into boring intellectual jousts that explain almost nothing.

When applied to the real world, as in Altman’s thought exercise, the apparatus of theory does little more than act as window-dressing to make guessing seem scientific. Jamming the template of game theory over something like the behavior of Vladimir Putin, especially this early in the crisis, is a kind of stunt: it’s a way of theatrically pushing data into one end of a big box and then pretending to read an objective answer at the other, the way Adam West’s Batman used to punch clues into the “Bat-Computer” and then watch it spit out a little card telling him exactly where the Riddler was about to strike next.

Those of us who think Putin is acting emotionally in an insulated, low-information environment (including Angela Merkel, whom Altman tut-tuts for not getting what Putin is about) are not just making it up as we go or randomly picking motives. We’re reaching that conclusion because we’ve been watching this situation for a long time, and in context, Putin’s actions seem reckless and violent. If Putin’s motives are as Altman describes them, then his actions are not only unreasonable, they run a great risk of being, in the end, self-defeating. But to see them in that context is more in keeping with the nature of the man as we’ve come to know him, the regime he’s created, and the culture in which he lives, all of which explain more to us than positing his choices as just another day at the office for the President of SimCity.

9 Questions To Ask About Biden’s Work With A Gas Company In Ukraine,"Twitter is abuzz with questions about the involvement of Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter with a gas company in Ukraine. The company, Burisma, allegedly appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors. In late April, around the time the vice president made an official trip to Ukraine, Burisma allegedly appointed Devon Archer, one of Hunter Biden’s business partners, to its board as well. Here’s a brief write-up on the story from the Moscow Times, an English-language news service based in Russia.

These dual announcements raise more questions than they answer. The prominence of the individuals involved — Hunter Biden is the vice president’s son, while Devon Archer was a major bundler for John Kerry and also his stepson’s college roommate — raises the question of whether the entire thing is a hoax.

1. What is Burisma?

Burisma appears to be a Ukrainian energy company with a focus on oil and gas exploration. However, independent information about the company is hard to find and even harder to verify. According to Businessweek:

Burisma Holdings Limited engages in oil and gas exploration and production. The company also engages in oil well drilling, production of liquefied natural gas, and undertaking geological studies. The company was incorporated in 2006 and is based in Limassol, Cyprus.

2. Is Burisma even a real company?

The company’s website is…rough, at best, and the domain does not appear to have even been registered until 2010 even though the company was allegedly founded in 2002 and incorporated in 2006. And as recently as July of 2013, the website was not even written in English.

Basic information about the business is also difficult to find. Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider noted on Twitter that the company lacked a profile in Bloomberg, an extensive database of business information, and had no Wikipedia presence whatsoever. Businessweek contained only a brief blurb about the company, stating that it was incorporated in 2006 and based in Cyprus.

Is Burisma a real company? Not one mention in the history of Bloomberg. No Wikipedia page, etc. — Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) May 13, 2014

3. Who is Hunter Biden?

Hunter Biden is Vice President Joe Biden’s son. He currently serves as the managing partner of Rosemont Seneca Partners, a financial and policy advisory firm. He was a long-time federal lobbyist, but left his old firm in September of 2008, before his father was elected as vice president.

4. Who is Devon Archer?

Devon Archer is a wealthy investor and Democratic campaign bundler with long ties to the family of Secretary of State John Kerry. He was the college roommate of Christopher Heinz, Kerry’s stepson, and also served as co-chair of the national finance committee for Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. According to a 2004 profile in the New York Observer:

Mr. Archer represents a new breed of fund-raiser. In this age, the person with the most connections, who collects contributions from the widest circle of friends and contacts, has become the new macher in party politics.



You could call Mr. Archer a “baby bundler,” a well-connected macher-in-training who has spent every free moment of the last two years tapping friends, family, business partners and even Republicans for contributions to the Kerry cause. Ever since the Massachusetts Senator announced his candidacy in 2003, the dimple-cheeked Mr. Archer has dedicated himself to hosting cocktail parties at old-boy hideaways like the University Club and the Links Club, attending weekly finance-committee pow-wows and dialing, dialing, dialing for dollars. He has coaxed as little as $50 from his friends and cajoled the maximum, $2,000, from his family and business associates. In the process, he has outpaced veteran bundlers more than twice his age and joining the finance committee alongside such finance gurus as Steven Rattner and Richard Holbrooke.



Now his hard work is paying off, with the kind of convention access lowly Hill staffers can only dream of. He has a room at the Four Seasons Hotel, tickets to all the hot parties, access to the convention floor and face time with Mr. Kerry. The convention is his induction into the Democratic elite, and when the bunting comes down and the four-day Boston romp is done, there will be little doubt that Mr. Archer is the Democratic equivalent of a made man.

According to his company’s web page, Archer also serves on the board of the Howard J. Heinz trust and as a trustee of the Heinz Family Office. Howard J. Heinz was the founder of Heinz foods.

5. Did Hunter Biden actually get appointed to Burisma’s board (and if so, did he accept the appointment)?

As of this morning, all we really had to go on regarding Biden’s involvement with Burisma is a press release from the company’s website. When Rosemont Seneca Partners, Biden’s firm, was contacted to confirm whether the board appointment announcement was accurate, the company refused to comment on Biden’s involvement with Burisma. However, according to at least one White House correspondent, White House press secretary Jay Carney effectively confirmed the appointment earlier this afternoon.

Carney says Hunter Biden is a private citizen; his work at Burisma does not reflect an endorsement by the VP or the Admin — Jared Rizzi (@JaredRizzi) May 13, 2014

Politico also appears to have confirmed the board appointment:

Hunter Biden, the younger son of Vice President Joe Biden, will be joining Ukraine’s largest private gas producer, the company announced in a statement

“The company’s strategy is aimed at the strongest concentration of professional staff and the introduction of best corporate practices, and we’re delighted that Mr. Biden is joining us to help us achieve these goals,” Alan Apter, Burisma Holdings’ chairman of the board of directors, said in a statement, which was reported by The Moscow Times on Tuesday.



Biden, joining the board, will be in charge of the legal unit, the company said and will provide support for Burisma Holdings “among international organizations.”

6. What about Devon Archer? Is he actually on the company’s board?

Again, all we have to go on is a single press release posted on the company’s web page. Rosemont Seneca Partners also refused to comment on Archer’s involvement with Burisma. However, given the apparent confirmation of Biden’s appointment by the White House earlier this afternoon, it is probably safe to assume that Archer’s appointment did, in fact, happen.

7. Why would a Ukrainian energy company want Devon Archer or Hunter Biden to serve on its board?

Assuming that they have been appointed to the board, the most innocent explanation is that the company wants to increase foreign direct investment and views Archer and Biden as having the experience to make that happen. Archer, for example, is a long-time investor and financier.

The most disturbing explanation is that the company is attempting to curry favor with the U.S. government by enlisting the services of the close family friend and campaign bundler of the Secretary of the State and the son of the vice president. After all, Archer notes on one of his company’s web pages that his firm’s “relationship network creates opportunities for our portfolio companies which then compound to greater outcomes for all parties.”

8. How does Joe Biden have anything to do with this?

As far as we know, he doesn’t have anything to do with it at this point. However, he did visit Ukraine a day before Archer was allegedly appointed to Burisma’s board. And the White House announced yesterday, shortly before Hunter Biden’s alleged appointment to Burisma’s board was announced, that the vice president would visit Cyprus next week. According to the brief Businessweek profile of Burisma, the company is officially located in Cyprus.

9. This has to be a hoax, right?

It’s so bizarre that you almost have to assume it’s a hoax. It sounds more like a cliched movie plot — a shady foreign oil company co-opts the vice president’s son in order to capture lucrative foreign investment contracts — than something that would actually happen in real life. But the indications as of this afternoon are that the board appointments actually happened, and that a Ukrainian energy company has retained the counsel of the vice president’s son and the Secretary of State’s close family friend and top campaign bundler.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/05/13/9-questions-to-ask-about-bidens-work-with-a-gas-company-in-ukraine/,2014-05-13
Eurovision Raises The Question: How Many Divisions Has RuPaul?,"Americans don’t pay much attention to something called “Eurovision,” and I supposed we usually shouldn’t. It’s a kind of pan-European version of “American Idol,” in which musical acts chosen to represent every country in Europe stage overproduced performances of inoffensive and quickly forgotten pop anthems. While it’s a competition, it seems to be less about the singing than about an intra-European popularity contest, and it’s common for viewers to vote in national and regional blocs to put their candidate—the one who represents, say, Eastern Europe—into the finals. The whole thing is a bit of European cultural nonsense, without much significance.

Except that this year produced an especially strange result. The winner is a former member of an Austrian boy band, now competing in drag as a woman. With a beard.

The bearded ladyboy’s performance probably has to be seen to be believed, so you’d better just check it out.

The whole thing is obviously a joke. It’s certainly not about the quality of the singing, which is middling at best; the song is described as a fake Bond anthem, but Adele needn’t worry about the competition. This is a combination of drag queen and sideshow act, complete with the performer’s cheesy stage name, Conchita Wurst.

So it’s not so much that anyone really likes it—statistically, the number of people for whom this is an actual esthetic or sexual preference has got to be minuscule—but rather that they wanted to prove some kind of point about how tolerant they are.

In the current geopolitical environment, this is being portrayed as a poke in the eye for Vladimir Putin.

For the majority of Eurovision fans, Conchita deserved her crown because she offered living proof that when it comes to sex, anything goes. Transvestites, trans-genders, cross-dressers, gays – even heterosexuals are allowed to express their preferences in today’s Europe….



Putin has depicted the West as the decadent incubator of gays and lesbians: too much freedom and diversity have created a soft and libertine people to be pitied and despised. The honest folk of Russia, Georgia and the Ukraine must steer clear of Western influence, lest they become infected by its perversions.



With her Eurovision victory, the Bearded Lady from Austria unwittingly fired the opening salvo in this culture war. Putin thinks that Westerners will prove a push-over when it comes to defending sexual freedom. I’m not so sure.

I don’t think Putin is going to view this as any kind of challenge. He will no doubt see it as validation of his appeals to religious tradition and his rhetoric about Europe’s “LGBT” agenda. It’s a domestic propaganda victory he could not possibly have achieved on his own.

But that’s not the problem. Putin has created a fascist regime that is casting about for a supporting ideology. If Europeans don’t give him this, he’ll seize on something else to show how decadent they have become—as opposed to the high moral standards of the drunken louts he has unleashed on Eastern Ukraine. So there is no reason for Europe to suppress its cultural freedom to appease Putin, just as there is no reason to do so to appease radical Islamists, who will hate the West no matter what we do.

The problem is what this really confirms: Europe’s failure to stand up to Putin, substituting symbolic gestures for real action. Europeans aren’t sending weapons or troops to Kiev. They’re not doubling or tripling their totally inadequate defense budgets. Instead, they’re voting in a singing contest for a bearded guy in a dress. Fine, you’re tolerant, but to paraphrase Stalin (it’s a very loose paraphrase): how many divisions has Ru Paul?

There is a kind of decadence behind this. The appeal of “Conchita” seems to be entirely a form of cultural negation, the fact that he/she overthrows the cultural standards of the past. But what is the alternative? Poland’s entry in Eurovision, for example, offered what seems to be an anthem about how great it is to be Slavic, featuring buxom blondes with long, braided hair in semi-traditional dress, performing what can only be described as erotic butter-churning. No, this is not a figure of speech or double entendre; they’re actually churning butter. This, also, has to be seen to be believed. But it is dull ethnic traditionalism enlivened by camp. It’s not the kind of ideal that can sustain European civilization.

That sums up the central problem of the European Union: It’s not clear what it stands for other than bureaucracy and political correctness, or what positive values it has to offer to the world. I’m not expecting anything so highbrow to spring from Eurovision, but Europe has a rich cultural legacy as the home of great ancient civilizations, of the Renaissance and Enlightenment, as the birthplace of capitalism and of the scientific and industrial revolutions. Yet they can’t summon the confidence to rediscover that legacy and embrace it, preferring to define themselves as a negation of their past—not just of their nationalist or fascist past, but of everything else.

That produces a cultural weakness and indecision which makes Europe vulnerable to challenges from much less enlightened, less progressive challengers. Eurovision is just a symptom of this, and so, in his own way, is Vladimir Putin.

The Role Of Family Choice In Early Childhood Education,"While flipping through an early childhood textbook in the Social Studies curriculum, I noticed these titles:

Unit 2 (Family), Lesson 4: I Am Important

Unit 2 (Family), Lesson 5: I Am Unique

Call me picky, but last time I checked the word “social” in the title Social Studies indicated the interaction between people. These lessons might merit a pass if they were filled with deep introspection, but even my kindergartener understood they were fluff and nonsense.

“I know I’m special,” she said. “They don’t need to tell me that.”

Hmm. Maybe a series of lessons on humility instead?

Most of the kindergarten curriculum teaches about community helpers and national holidays, none of which was new to my daughter. Advocates for universal pre-k (UPK), the movement to provide preschool education as part of the public school system, and for public kindergarten understandably want civic duty, citizenship, and national identity as part of the curriculum because the enterprise is funded with public money. The federal government’s goals for early childhood contain a good amount of economic language: return on investments, future workforce. Taxpayers want to know how the money will be replenished.

I would think that a discussion of world geography, especially current events in Ukraine or Nigeria, might instill thankfulness for the freedoms we enjoy much more than lessons on oneself.

Lessons on self-worth and affirmation do not produce these goals. Children need to be taught gratitude and loyalty because they arrive in this world self-centered. Even as an adult, my appreciation for my citizenship within the United States of America renews in contrast to world events. I would think that a discussion of world geography, especially current events in Ukraine or Nigeria, might instill thankfulness for the freedoms we enjoy much more than lessons on oneself.

Companies and educators have developed early childhood curriculum based on the fact that one-third of children arrive in kindergarten ill prepared for beginning reading and math. From there, though, logic follows the path of a bad riddle: What does a bureaucrat do when he finds 30 children needing education? Answer: Asks for funding for 100 children. The curriculum assumes that all children need the same basic knowledge, trying to get them all on the same page. Statistics demonstrate that this redundancy is unnecessary for nearly two-thirds of all children.

Early childhood pedagogy also feeds the limited scope of preschool education because it says to begin with topics familiar to children and build their knowledge from there. I accept the fundamental soundness of using background, prior knowledge, and personal experiences as aids to language comprehension. As an example, if a child has only heard the word “trunk” used in relationship to a vehicle, she will need some help the first time she hears that an elephant has a trunk. So, yes, vocabulary development requires some foundation in a child’s experience. This principle does not mean, however, that all children need the same background knowledge. In fact, it means that the curriculum should expose children to new experiences and knowledge to build their comprehension, but that does not happen for many children until first grade.

Mothers have commented to me that kindergarten is just a year to “get used to school,” meaning their children did not really learn much. One of my neighbors, a retired school teacher, spends the morning teaching her granddaughter before she puts her on the bus for kindergarten so that she’ll learn to read. If that’s the case in kindergarten, UPK would most likely suffer the same deficiencies.

Is it any surprise, then, that parents might wish an alternative to the accepted UPK and kindergarten curriculum? Wanted: purposeful, insightful education for young children.

Last summer, my mother surprised me when she declared, “All good parents home school their children.” In case you have the urge to applaud or vilify her for that comment, please know that she taught physical education in a public school for over a decade before sending all seven of her children to the local central school—she has no particular affinity for formal home schooling per se. She only meant to underscore her firm belief that parents should not rely upon schools to provide the full gamut of character development or replace parent’s responsibility for their children. No matter where children spend their day in formal education, whether it be public, private, or home school, parents should teach their children the way to process and think about the information they receive.

In my desire to give the reins of education back to parents, though, I recognize a difficult truth: Some parents do not know what their children need to be prepared for formal education. At best, they have a vague impression of what quality preschool education would be. Many families place their children in a child care setting because that is what they believe is expected for them to do. The accepted pattern is child care, preschool, kindergarten. Many mothers, even those who are increasingly staying at home with young children for reasons other than unemployment, cannot comfortably articulate what their children should be able to do by kindergarten.

I spoke to a mother recently whose son has been in a very good day care since he was five months old. When her son turned four, she wondered if she should take him out of day care and put him into a preschool to prepare him for kindergarten. I encouraged her to speak to the day care about preschool expectations, and when she did, she discovered that the teachers at the day care had been evaluating her son’s alphabetical and phonological awareness, his counting and number recognition. This mother, as involved as she was, had no idea what educational standards were promoted at her son’s day care even though he had been there for years.

The fact that families may not be aware of the educational needs of their children, however, is not enough to wholesale hand over the education of children to any institution. Latino and Asian-American families tend to prefer home and less institutionalized settings for child care, and while most of the Asian-American preschoolers enter kindergarten well-prepared to read and develop math skills, Latino children tend to lag behind (See Standardized Childhood by Bruce Fuller for a lengthy discussion). If these families will not choose UPK or other formal educational settings, how can these children receive better early literacy skills?

If we are serious about family choice, we need to provide families with the resources to make sound decisions for their young children.

Some groups are trying to think creatively and find ways to give preschool education back to families who choose child care settings other than UPK by providing necessary training. The Reach Out and Read program, for example, collects donated books, gives the books to pediatricians who then give the books to low-income patients during visits. Doctors and nurses show parents how to read to their children and instruct parents in the importance of reading to their children. Likewise, community centers and churches, especially those that offer English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes, play a role in supporting families and sharing important information about early childhood education. ESOL for parents could include even more information about language development in young children, how to support that development, and where their children might be able to receive quality schooling locally. If we are serious about family choice, we need to provide families with the resources to make sound decisions for their young children.

Our family has decided that we do not need one more generic lesson on mail carriers, teachers, or police officers. If community helpers show up, they need to arrive with some novel information about the history of the occupation or their training. The girls will learn their special giftedness through hard work and accomplishments, not by repeating to themselves, “I am unique.” They will learn that they are important when adults converse with them like the intelligent people they are. Leave the public pre-kindergarten option for other people to choose, but I think I’ll walk my children down a different path.

"With Bergdahl Trade, Obama Stops Going Through the Motions","Last week, President Obama was widely criticized for the emptiness of his big speech on foreign policy and national security at West Point. This weekend, with the trade of five high-level Taliban leaders for ransomed American soldier Bowe Bergdahl, we saw the consequences of that emptiness.

There is one thing that wasn’t quite captured in the analysis of Obama’s speech last week. It’s not that the speech was empty. It’s that it was too full. There was something there for “realists” who are skeptical of intervention. (“Since World War II, some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint but from our willingness to rush into military adventures without thinking through the consequences, without building international support and legitimacy for our action, without leveling with the American people about the sacrifices required.”) But there was also quite a lot for for the neoconservatives to applaud. (“I believe that a world of greater freedom and tolerance is not only a moral imperative; it also helps keep us safe.”) The only people who really got left out in the cold were the liberal interventionists, who were basically told that the Obama administration will sit back and applaud quietly while somebody else stops atrocities.

What made the speech seem empty wasn’t that Obama said nothing. It’s that he didn’t mean any of it. He borrows a lot of goals and rhetoric from established schools of foreign policy—including slightly modified versions of the Bush administration strategy (which was never actually as radical and outside the mainstream as Bush’s opponents claimed). The difference is that Obama does not intend to take action to achieve any of those goals.

The signature passage of the speech was when he cited, as a success of American leadership, the crisis in Ukraine.

In Ukraine, Russia’s recent actions recall the days when Soviet tanks rolled into Eastern Europe. But this isn’t the Cold War. Our ability to shape world opinion helped isolate Russia right away. Because of American leadership, the world immediately condemned Russian actions, Europe and the G-7 joined with us to impose sanctions, NATO reinforced our commitment to Eastern European allies, the IMF is helping to stabilize Ukraine’s economy, OSCE monitors brought the eyes of the world to unstable parts of Ukraine.



And this mobilization of world opinion and international institutions served as a counterweight to Russian propaganda and Russian troops on the border and armed militias in ski masks.



This weekend, Ukrainians voted by the millions. Yesterday, I spoke to their next president. We don’t know how the situation will play out, and there will remain grave challenges ahead, but standing with our allies on behalf of international order, working with international institutions, has given a chance for the Ukrainian people to choose their future—without us firing a shot.

What Obama is describing is what everybody else did to deal with the crisis after it became clear that the US wasn’t going to do anything. And despite his sanguine description, the outcome is still very much uncertain, as Kiev begins a long counter-insurgency campaign to regain control of its Eastern provinces, which are under occupation by irregular Russian forces.

In the past, particularly when President Obama sounded the uncertain trumpet of his “surge” in Afghanistan, I described his foreign policy as “Bush without conviction,” meaning that he was borrowing elements of the previous administration’s diplomatic and military strategy, but without really believing that it would succeed or that he should try very hard at it.

This is how Obama squares the circle between his Bush-lite official strategy and the promise he articulated early on in his 2009 speech in Cairo, which was about ending America’s foreign policy dominance, moving us to the sidelines and making us irrelevant and non-exceptional. The solution Obama has come up with is to pay lip service to America as exceptional and indispensible, as he does rather loudly in the West Point speech—while implementing his broad goals for American leadership in a way so cautious and inadequate that it makes us irrelevant and unexceptional in practice. It’s a plan to make America more like Canada: a country with nice aspirations in foreign policy but no power to do much of anything about them.

But this still required President Obama to go through the motions of having those big aspirations. That’s the significance of the Bowe Bergdahl terrorists-for-hostage trade: Obama has stopped going through the motions.

First, consider the terrorists we traded for Sergeant Bergdahl. If you run down the list it’s quickly obvious that these were not lower-level Taliban hangers-on—drivers or couriers or the like—but top-level organizers. Nominally, they are being released to the custody of the Emir of Qatar, and “The US has ‘appropriate assurances’ that Qatar will be able to secure the detainees there, a U.S. official said. The detainees are under a travel ban for a year.” Oh, well, a travel ban for a whole year. That gives you an idea how secure the detainees will be. So yes, we’re basically just letting these guys out on the street.

The obvious concern is that this is how President Obama plans to make good on his promise to shut down the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. This prisoner release is a trial balloon for whether the administration can get away with just sending the detainees back out into the world.

Then there is the question of whether Bergdahl was worth the trade. The men he served with in Afghanistan are loudly complaining that Bergdahl deserted his post after turning against the war, e-mailing his parents that “The horror that is America is disgusting.” I don’t think being a disgruntled soldier or an obnoxious anti-American leftist means he deserves mistreatment as a captive of the Taliban. But I do think it ought to enter into our calculations about how much we are willing to trade to get him back.

In this case, not only are we releasing some very dangerous people, but we did so without consulting the Afghan government in Kabul—which is, after all, going to have to deal with the consequences. Maybe that’s the point of the one-year travel ban: by that time, most of our troops will be gone and it will be a problem for the Afghans to deal with.

Predictable, the Taliban are hailing this as a victory, with Mullah Omar gloating that “The sacrifice of our Mujahedin have resulted in the release of our senior leaders from the hand of the enemy.” It certainly creates an incentive for the Taliban to grab more Americans to trade, and it gives them hope of getting more of their top people returned to them. It’s another indication that they can hang on and wait us out, because in a couple of years we’re going to be gone.

There are those who will assure us that this no big deal because this “is how most wars end.” Well, it’s how a war ends if all you want to do is end it, to get America out with little concern for the long-term consequences.

That’s the pattern we’re now seeing. Obama has stopped going through the motions of caring what happens in Afghanistan. Before his term is over, he wants us out of Afghanistan, he wants terrorist detainees out of our custody, he wants to wash his hands of the last vestiges of American intervention overseas.

This is his declaration that he’s just not interested in the War on Terrorism any more. Unfortunately, I suspect we’re going to find in the years to come that the war is still interested in us.

What The Downed Flight MH17 Means For Russia,"Here’s what the shootdown of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 means: Russia, with Vladimir Putin at the wheel, just drove off the edge of a cliff.

Now, by this I don’t mean that the United States and the European Union are going to charge in with a new round of sanctions, provide lethal aid to Ukraine, patrol the skies of Ukraine, or anything of that nature. The West didn’t react in time, or with enough resolve, to the initial invasion and partition of Ukraine last spring, and there’s no reason to think our reaction will be any more effective or resolute this time. It would be reassuring to think America and Europe will now fully engage on the problem of Russian aggression, but it’s unlikely.

As far as Russia’s future is concerned, however, it doesn’t matter. The moment Flight 17 exploded was the moment that Putin’s foreign policy officially went over the ledge, and with it his dreams of restored Russian greatness.

Until now, Moscow claimed it was protecting the interests of Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. That was nonsense right from the start, but it was nonsense the Americans and Europeans decided they could live with, as galling as it was. (Who, after all, protects the rights of Russians in Russia? Certainly not Putin.) The West looked away as Putin seized Crimea, as we conveniently convinced ourselves that this was some odd ethnic quarrel in which we had no say. Now that a civilian airliner has been blown out of the sky by a Russian missile, however, there can be no further denial that Russia is actively pursuing a major proxy war against its neighbor in the center of Europe, and with a brutality that would make the now-departed marshals of the old Soviet high command smile with approval. This is no longer a war on Ukraine, but a war on the entire post-Cold War international order.

Putin, for his part, has already blamed Ukraine for the loss of the airliner in a careful, weird statement that makes no sense. His complaint, essentially, is that the authorities in Kyiv had the temerity to defend their country against Russia’s invasion and the daily, piecemeal dismantling of the Ukrainian state. With the exception of the usual Kremlin apologists (Professor Stephen Cohen dutifully carried this argument forward the night of the shootdown on Al Jazeera), no one is going to take that position seriously with 300 innocent people strewn all over the fields of eastern Ukraine.

Putin is deflecting blame, of course. He has no choice: he armed, paid, and unleashed a ragtag army of goons in eastern Ukraine, under the command of a Russian intelligence officer who was supposed to provide some adult supervision. Now they’ve betrayed the Kremlin and screwed up.

This leaves Putin with few options. He could admit that the plane was destroyed by the separatists he supports with weapons he provided, and thus confess that Russia itself is complicit in mass murder. Or he can claim that the downing took place without his knowledge or control, which means he will have to cop to providing sophisticated arms to a bunch of bloodthirsty stooges who don’t care who gets hurt. For now, he may have to cut the Russian separatists loose from Moscow, but given Putin’s history, he might also double down and dig in. Either way, the stink of this act will now irrevocably cling to the Russian Federation for as long as Putin is in charge, no matter what his rationalizations.

The Soviet Union – Putin’s first love – likewise never escaped the stain of the downing of a Korean passenger jet in 1983. Just as the Russian separatists are doing now, the Soviets tried to prevent access to the crash area, lied about their own actions, and then blamed others. Although the West imposed some nominal sanctions, the real price was paid in public diplomacy, because the Soviets never recovered an ability to push any further propaganda about their commitment to peace after an act of such savagery. Indeed, when the world erupted in anger, Soviet leader (and former KGB chief) Yuri Andropov was genuinely shocked. Like Putin, he and his comrades lived in a bubble in Moscow, and the public outcry only cemented the Soviet leadership’s paranoid conviction that the world was out to get the USSR. Putin, a typical and mediocre product of Andropov’s KGB, will likely react the same way.

Andropov didn’t have to live with opprobrium for long: he passed away less than six months after the KAL 007 disaster. Putin, however, is a relatively young, healthy man, and he will continue to occupy the world stage as Russia’s supreme ruler. But he will never again be able to portray himself as a savvy, cool broker in international affairs, nor Russia as just another great power. Now, he’s just another Soviet-era thug, a perception that was already growing before the Malaysian airliner plunged out of the sky. No matter how the current crisis ends, Putin’s name will forever be tied to this outrage, and his personal bid to create a more respected Russia through violence and intimidation is permanently defunct.

In the short term, the international community may not manage to muster sanctions against Russia that are any more effective than those imposed on the old USSR. But over the longer term, Putin has done far worse to his own country than any punishment we can levy. He has returned Russia to its cursed role as an international pariah, a country incapable of conducting itself without brutality and conquest. Putin’s Kremlin will likely pay only a modest price for now, but Russia and its people will have to bear the brunt of an increasing and corrosive isolation thrust upon them by their leader and his outdated Soviet fears and insecurities. If the Russian people one day find that NATO has renewed its purpose and that the globalized world community has moved on without them, they will have only Vladimir Putin to blame.

Why The Russians Are Panicking Over Flight 17,"The one emotion most of us who study Russia never associate with the men of the Kremlin is panic. They’re not the type. They’re more like mobsters, prone to say “we have a problem” rather than to freak out. They think everything has a solution, although sometimes that solution might mean someone has to take nine grams of lead behind the ear. They do not raise their voices—my experience is that most Russian tough-guys are mumblers, not yellers—and they get things done, even if the final outcome might lack a certain, say, elegance.

That’s why it’s unusual to see the government of Vladimir Putin, and maybe even Putin himself, panicking over the downing of Malaysian Airline Flight 17. For the first time in a long time, maybe even since Putin’s first election to power, the Russian regime has a problem it cannot solve, one that will cost the Kremlin in both money and reputation.

First, let’s review what’s happened, and use the real-world version of events, rather than the paranoid, flaky stuff coming out of less responsible news outlets (like, say, all of the ones in Russia).

Malaysian Air Flight 17 was crossing the Ukraine-Russia border when it was blown out of the sky. We have a high degree of certainty (and probably more inside the governments of the United States and NATO) that the plane was downed with a BUK anti-air missile system. In fact, it’s starting to look like there was a BUK battery in the area when the airplane was destroyed.

We have a mountain of evidence that the Russians were up to their necks in this. The BUK is a Russian system, found in both Ukraine and Russia, but it looks like the Russians brought some over the border, along with Russian military intelligence guys—the men actually running this “partition Ukraine” operation—and they taught some of the locals, including transplanted mercenary “separatists,” how to use them. The thing is, the BUK is really too complicated to use without adult supervision, and that’s especially true of a battery.

And now we get to the panic. Evidence is mounting not only that the BUK that killed MH17 came from Russia, but that the firing on the airliner was either supervised or ordered, or even operated, by Russian personnel.

If this is the case, the “lone rebel with an itchy trigger finger” theory goes out the window, and the “Russia is running a reckless and undeclared air war inside Ukraine” theory comes into sharp focus. Suddenly, an act of terrorism becomes an act of interstate war, directed with subterfuge and deniability (what my colleague John Schindler has dubbed “Special War”) with the goal of dismembering the Ukrainian state.

Kremlin Conversations

Putin, I’m sure, was briefed ahead of time and told that such an accident could never happen.

No, Mr. President, we will sweep any Ukrainian military jets from the sky. Yes, Mr. President, we will control their airspace, and paralyze them, until they accept partition, as we did with Crimea. No, Mr. President, we are professionals and there is no chance of error or detection. We have trained to fight Americans, this will be a piece of cake.

In other words, a slam-dunk. (Assuming the Russians are inclined to basketball metaphors. It’s not really their sport.) And then a few weeks later, some somber-looking, sorry bastard walks in and says: Sir, we have a problem. The briefing begins, and the bad news rolls.

It was our stuff. Our missile. Our goons. Commanded by our officers. Yes, we’ve been caught on camera. Yes, there was some clumsiness on social media. No, we have not allowed anyone near the crash site, but we can’t hold it off forever. The men involved are in hiding. Except Strelkov, who has said the plane was full of dead bodies. (He freelanced that one, sir.)

How far does this go, Mr. President? Well, sir—and here the aide might shuffle some papers uncomfortably to avoid noting that the orders came from the very top—we can deny it all, but sooner or later the trail leads back through military intelligence to special channels in the military, to special channels here in the President’s office, to…well, you know…

The Russians are busted. To use an American folk saying, they are screwed, chewed, and barbecued.

At this point, Putin and his advisers have to know the game is up, and thus they have resorted to the only time they remember when they felt really competent and in control of events: the Soviet days. And the stupid, dangerous ideas begin to tumble out, the product of panic rather than policy:

Put out the story that Ukraine was responsible. Suggest the plane was off course and thus imply it was doing something nefarious. (Didn’t we work that angle in the 1983 crash?) Pledge our cooperation, but tell those idiots in Donetsk we want the black boxes in Moscow immediately. Don’t talk to the Western press. Send Churkin to take his obligatory ass-whipping from Sam Power…

But most importantly, keep doubling down on everything.

Make sure the crash site belongs to us and no one else. Obfuscate as much as possible about who was doing what, and where. Suggest the Ukraine military planned this all along. See if you can dig up old stories about that Iranian plane the Americans hit, what was it? Iran 655? Yeah, work that for a while.

None of this will go anywhere. The Russians are busted. To use an American folk saying, they are screwed, chewed, and barbecued. They know it. Someone’s got to go down for this, and there are obvious candidates. The question, as in any Mafia where something’s gone bad, is who rats out whom first. Because sooner or later, all will be known.

So What’s the Fallout?

Panic in Moscow is hard to spot, but even from 6000 miles away, it’s easy to smell, and the metallic stink of fear is rising off the palace offices of the Russian executive as if from the gurneys in a cancer ward on the morning of an operation.

The only question, really, is how far Putin wants to go toward a trade war, economic collapse, further status as a pariah, maybe even open war, only to save face.

The only question, really, is how far Putin wants to go toward a trade war, economic collapse, further status as a pariah, maybe even open war, only in order to save face. The conventional wisdom is that he has to cut the insurgency loose.

Maybe. But if he doesn’t want to, he may settle for leaving a grinding conflict in place for now, and will claim that any real investigation and closure is impossible. He can then place his hopes in the West’s short attention span, and wait until all this blows over.

That would all work if it were 1975. But it’s not. I suspect the investigation and the tick-tock of the moments before the BUK fire are already clear and widely distributed enough that we have the complete case against the “separatists” with a bill of particulars that stretches right to the rug in front of Putin’s desk.

He knows it, and he knows that we know it. And until he finds a way to square this circle, panic—and more death—will be the order of the day. I wish I had good advice for him to extricate himself. But there isn’t any, and it would not be mine to give even if there were.

How To Mind America’s Business,"As China upsets the Pacific rim’s peace that Americans established at the cost of so much blood in World War II, Russia kills to reverse as much of the Cold War’s result as it can, and more Muslims than ever are inclined to harm us, many Americans’ premise regarding international affairs—a fair summary of which is “America ought to mind its own business”—leads others to fear that trimming the American eagle’s talons and sticking its head in the sand would increase our perils.

How anyone might distinguish America’s business from that of others, or go about minding that business regarding the Pacific, Eurasia, the Muslim world, or Latin America is not so important as is the nature of the premise itself. That premise—minding America’s business, keeping America’s peace and winning its wars—is not the counsel of retreat. Nor is it novel and untried. It is in fact the essence of the foreign policy by which statesmen from George Washington to Theodore Roosevelt, the men on Mount Rushmore, grew the American eagle to maturity.

Let us consider what is America’s international business in our time, and what it would take properly to mind that business.

What Are Foreign Conflicts to Us?

Our chief business is neither more nor less than what it was for our founding generation and what it has been for every generation of immigrants: to live free lives on a higher plane, moral and material, than elsewhere. To this effect, John Winthrop in 1630 quoted Moses and Jesus to the people who founded Boston: our purpose is to be a “city on a hill” whose light may give glory to God and enlighten humanity. By these words, Ronald Reagan reminded us repeatedly that America’s purpose is to be exceptionally good. We know that being good Americans, at peace with one another, is difficult.

Now as ever, we deal with foreigners for the primary purpose of preventing them from adding to that difficulty. Washington devoted his farewell address to warning us that nothing so fouls our nest at home as does involvement in foreigners’ quarrels. Our current experience with no-win wars to fix other nations—wars that have divided us and militarized government bureaucracies used increasingly for partisan purposes—confirms that warning.

Washington and his successors were neither pacifists, nor isolationists, nor imperialists. Neither should we be. Better than our contemporaries, they pursued mutual forbearance with different social-political systems. They understood that hostile powers are to be kept as far away as possible, alliances are to serve specific purposes, wars are extraordinary events to be fought with all our might unto victory or not at all, and pirates are to be destroyed. They knew, and we should remember, that respect is earned by speaking seldom, and more softly than the size of our stick might warrant. They measured all dealings with foreigners by one standard: What is this to us?

Only Americans Fear America

During the past generation, administrations of both parties have acted against common sense, increasing commitments around the globe, including to the territorial integrity of the Soviet empire’s former members, which they had no intention of fulfilling, while whittling down and spreading out America’s military. They responded to the Muslim regimes’ incitement of anti-American violence by trying to settle their internal conflicts and reforming their societies. As a result, today the only people in the world who fear American military action are the American people themselves. Administrations of both parties have continued the 1960s policy of leaving America undefended against serious missile attack. Thus impotently meddling in others’ business while failing to mind America’s, they have earned the world’s disrespect.

What is America’s business with China’s attempt to substitute itself for the order that has served us all so well since 1945? Its preparations for controlling nearby seas from the shore trump our diminishing sea-based power. China’s continuing capacity to point out that any American attempt to save Taiwan (or any other of its targets) would risk the loss of American cities to missile attack underlines the un-seriousness of current U.S. pretenses to uphold that order. Seriousness would require both U.S. missile defenses and U.S. bases in the nearby islands well-enough defended and potent enough to challenge China’s strategy of sea control. Otherwise, better to abandon our pretenses before they get us into worse trouble.

Making Themselves Our Business

Vladimir Putin stated that the Soviet Union’s demise was the century’s biggest catastrophe. But for us, it was among the greatest blessings. That is why his attempt to re-create as much of it as he can is some business of ours. Ukraine has always been the key to Putin’s venture. Europe is morally and politically incapable of stopping that venture, and will cooperate with anything we may do only under duress. Geography makes senseless any U.S. military intervention other than supply to Ukraine. But U.S. economic leverage on Russia can be overwhelming—provided it also excludes from economic intercourse with America any nation that has any dealings with Russia. The rest of the world would mightily resent such a measure. But it would have no choice. We must face facts: serious economic measures are not cheap, while cheap ones buy only contempt.

Increasingly since the 1970s, and most violently in our time, countless Muslims, sensing American statesmen’s weakness and irresolution, have made themselves our business. Iran’s 1979 seizure of our embassy and its personnel was an act of war. Our failure to treat it as such opened the floodgates of terrorism. Our attempts to stem that tide by trying to identify and sort individuals and groups whom we consider noxious out of the several Muslim countries—effectively to police those countries—was doomed from the start and opened the gates wider. In fact, policing foreign lands is none of our business. Rather, our business is to hold those lands’ rulers and potentates responsible with their lives for anything that comes out of them or that threatens to come out of them that might harm us. They should be certain that failure to prevent their subjects from harming us would result in America descending upon them—with nation-destruction rather than nation-building—and that they would be America’s prime targets.

Minding our business is serious business.

The Foreign Policy Of The Next Republican Establishment President,"Whoever carries the Republican establishment’s flag into the 2016 presidential elections—whether Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, or anyone else—must propose a foreign policy different from the essentially bipartisan approach of the past hundred years. This approach has diminished America by disconnecting ends from means while combining “the unbridled tongue with the unready hand.” The American people demand something else. There is no sign the Republican establishment understands what legacy it would have to overcome.

Republican words have been bigger, and the means they have deployed have been even more impotent.

The standard Republican campaign on foreign policy—vows to stand strong against our enemies and to assert America’s leadership in the world—will not restore to Republicans the presumption of superior national security stewardship. That is what Ronald Reagan had earned with his approach to the Cold War: “We win, they lose.” But Reagan was a rebel whom the Republican establishment tried to crush before he came into office, stymied while in office, and whose legacy it erased when he left. Rather, ruling-class Republicans will have to explain why we should expect from them other than what Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and the Bush dynasty gave America before and after Reagan.

Speaking loudly while whittling down the capacity to back up words has been the hallmark of our bipartisan foreign policy. Since circa 1900, the Republican mainstream, confused with the rest of this country’s ruling class, has led America increasingly into commitments bigger than the capacity and will to fulfill them—that is, into insolvency. If one were to distinguish a peculiarly Republican component out of this bipartisan compote, that component would be even heavier in words and lighter in the means to effectuate them than its Democratic counterpart. Republican words have been bigger, and the means they have deployed have been even more impotent.

Such as Jeb Bush and Christie are sure to talk “tougher than thou” on foreign policy. Their challenge will be to show how they would actually return U.S. foreign policy to a solvent balance it has not enjoyed for a century.

How the Elites Eroded U.S. Power

Theodore Roosevelt’s “speak softly and carry a big stick” had summed up the solvent foreign policy that America had practiced since the days of John Quincy Adams: keeping America’s peace and winning America’s wars. But Elihu Root, TR’s own secretary of State, won the 1912 Nobel Peace Prize for having convinced America’s bipartisan elites to focus foreign policy on bettering mankind. His chosen tool was a set of impotent arbitration treaties. By 1916, when Republican Charles Evans Hughes nearly beat Woodrow Wilson for the presidency, TR’s view of foreign policy had become a minority view among well-bred Republicans. In 1921, Secretary of State Hughes conceived a set of treaties that have typified American foreign policy into our time: an arms-control deal that reduced U.S. naval forces in the Pacific below those of Japan and committed the United States to not fortify our bases there, while at the same time promising to uphold the independence and territorial integrity of China. Republican and Democratic elites were sure that Hughes had ensured peace. In fact, he had paved the way for World War II.

When China, frightened by Soviet military superiority, begged for America’s help, Nixon did not demand a price.

Post-war “containment” was the Democratic and Republican establishments’ compromise. But neither managed to prevent the Communist world from breaking out of it, first in China, then in Korea, southeast Asia, Cuba, Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, etc. Establishment Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles cut arguably the most pathetic figure with his declaration that he would retaliate “massively” (i.e. with nukes) against communist breakouts “at times and places of our own choosing.” Sen. William Fulbright (D-AR) punctured that pretense by asking for an example. Dulles had none.

Barry Goldwater, however, had one. Channeling Douglas MacArthur, who had actually won a war, Goldwater said that if we were going to oppose Communist aggression in Vietnam we should use all we had utterly to destroy the enemy, or we should not fight at all. But Goldwater, too, was a rebel against the Republican establishment. It labeled him a primitive warmonger, and joined the Democratic establishment in preferring a more sophisticated policy.

Republican Richard Nixon, who learned sophistication from establishment guru Henry Kissinger, will be remembered as the first U.S. president to lose a war. Nixon, on the establishment’s behalf and to the American people’s disbelief, also signed the treaty that forbade the U.S. government from defending America against ballistic missiles. Then, when China, frightened by Soviet military superiority, begged for America’s help, Nixon did not demand a price. Instead, he paid for the privilege of helping Beijing by downgrading America’s relations with the nationalist Chinese and throwing them out of the United Nations. Gerald Ford’s foreign policy, under the same Kissinger, was to facilitate the Soviet Union’s control over its empire. Ford let it slip out in a presidential debate by stating that the people of Poland were really free, although occupied by the Red Army. That slip elected Jimmy Carter, who proved far tougher toward the communist world. Carter, not any Republican, moved America away from Mutual Assured Destruction by retargeting U.S. missiles from Soviet cities to Soviet missile forces, and started the construction of new U.S. missile systems for precisely that purpose.

Propping Up the Soviet Union

Reagan had done his best to end the Soviet Union. But as it was coming apart, Republican Establishmentarians George H. W. Bush and his secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James Baker did their best to keep it together, aided by future Republican establishmentarian Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. For once, their incompetence paid off.

The American people came to the conclusion that the Republicans really did not know what they were doing. Not unreasonable.

In hot pursuit of “a new world order,” Bush “41” reacted to Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait by sending half million superbly equipped U.S. troops. But, by using them to do Saddam only a little harm, and then stationing some in Saudi Arabia, he earned a reputation for impotence for America, while inflaming the Muslim world’s paranoia about interference in their civilization. He then confirmed his combination of impotence and interference by undertaking “nation-building” in Somalia.

For its final defining act, the “Bush 41” administration set in motion (in 1994 the W.J. Clinton administration consummated) a deal by which the United States committed (with intentionally ambiguous fine print) to uphold the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine giving Russia its huge stock of nuclear weapons. In 2014, as Russia annexed Crimea and threatened the rest of Ukraine, the U.S. government reneged with bluster rather than redeem a nutty commitment.

Bush’s actions let the Muslim world know that anti-Americanism is safer than ever.

The George W. Bush administration finished off what remained of America’s stock of respect among nations. In the aftermath of 9/11, the Middle East’s potentates had quashed celebrations in their cities, terrified that American would take out rage on them for having stoked terrorism. President Bush’s September 20 speech, promising to make no distinction between terrorists and whoever helps them, reduced them to begging us for mercy. But Bush’s actions let them know that anti-Americanism is safer than ever.

Bush attacked Afghanistan’s Taliban—persons marginal to the Middle East’s anti-American terrorism—and settled down to the “nation building” that he had denounced as a candidate. Then he squandered the fear of America his overthrow of Hussein had sparked within other terrorist sponsors by agreeing to Saudi requests to occupy Iraq to settle its internal quarrels (i.e. to save the Sunni rulers from the Shia’s revenge). As American troops lost life and limb driving through perpetually re-filled minefields; as the Syrian regime acted as headquarters for the Muslim world’s war against the U.S. occupation (with private Saudi financing); as successive U.S. secretaries of State nevertheless continued to support Syria’s suzerainty over Lebanon in partnership with Iran; as Iran continued to kill Americans in Iraq while the Bush administration complained about it without retaliating: while George W. Bush extolled Islam as “the religion of peace” while Muslim terrorism continued to increase; and as “homeland security” impinged on Americans in increasingly partisan ways, the American people came to the conclusion that the Republicans really did not know what they were doing. Not unreasonable.

Reaping the Whirlwind

But the logic of partisanship had turned establishment Republicans into establishment foreign policy’s blindest defenders. They were sure that “the surge”—a program that consisted primarily of ceasing to fight Iraq’s Sunnis for control of Sunni-majority areas and instead of arming and paying them to control these areas—had “worked.” To do what, they were less sure. Republican establishment candidate John McCain said that U.S. troops should stay in Iraq for 100 years, if necessary.

As terrorists rampage over the world, as Russia and China show contempt for America, the American people reasonably desire a president who exhibits some sense of how America is to be defended. But Republican establishmentarians who promise to increase the defense budget and say that, in defense of America’s interest, “everything is on the table” will not be taken seriously.

Just what do they propose to do about what? With what? And what reason does anyone have to believe that any of these things will achieve what the American people want? Establishment Republicans should get used to such questions.

"If You Are Not Using the Presidency, Do You Mind If We Borrow It?","President Lincoln once said to an over-cautious general, “If you are not using the army, I should like to borrow it for a short while.”

After yesterday’s press conference, I think we might need to say, to our disengaged, apathetic commander-in-chief: if you’re not using the presidency, would you mind if we borrowed it?

When asked what he intended to do about the biggest foreign policy crisis of the moment, the rise of the “Islamic State” (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, here is what the commander-in-chief had to say.

I don’t want to put the cart before the horse. We don’t have a strategy yet. I think what I’ve seen in some of the news reports suggests that folks are getting a little further ahead of where we’re at than we currently are. And I think that’s not just my assessment, but the assessment of our military, as well. We need to make sure that we’ve got clear plans, that we’re developing them. At that point, I will consult with Congress and make sure that their voices are heard. But there’s no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.

Surely, isn’t this is an emergency? With the Islamic State hacking off the heads of American journalists, planning attacks with weapons of mass destruction and spreading its influence to Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, we have to act quickly, don’t we? Nah, it can wait until after Obama’s golf vacation, and then until after Congress gets back from its recess, and then for who knows how long.

Moreover, Obama hinted that whatever he does will not really be a strategy but a reaction to events, an attempt merely to limit or contain the Islamic State.

[T]he options that I’m asking for from the joint chiefs focuses primarily on making sure that ISIL is not overrunning Iraq…. [M]y priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that ISIL made in Iraq are rolled back and that Iraq has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself.

And it won’t really be his strategy. It won’t be a plan for what the United States will do. As with most of Obama’s foreign policy, it will be a plan for what he hopes others will do. In this case, he’s hoping for “strong regional partners” whom he can lead from behind.

I’m encouraged so far that countries in the region, countries that don’t always agree on many things, increasingly recognize the primacy of the threat that ISIL poses to all of them. And I’ve asked Secretary Kerry to travel to the region to continue to build the coalition that’s needed to meet this threat….



This should be a wake-up call to Sunni, to Shia, to everybody that a group like ISIS is beyond the pale; that they have no vision or ideology beyond violence and chaos and the slaughter of innocent people. And as a consequence, we’ve got to all join together—even if we have differences on a range of political issues—to make sure that they’re rooted out.

That part about “countries that don’t always agree on many things” and those with whom “we have differences” may be a veiled reference to Iran, with whom Obama has been not-so-subtly seeking a de facto alliance. But ISIS has a lot in common with Iran, and there’s evidence that Iran’s satellite, the Assad regime in Syria, deliberately fostered the rise of ISIS because it serves their interests.

Obama shows a similar lack of interest in developing a strategy when it comes to the second big foreign policy crisis, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Obama and his State Department have refused to call an “invasion.”

What is his plan for countering Russia?

Next week, I’ll be in Europe to coordinate with our closest allies and partners…. At the NATO summit in the United Kingdom, we’ll focus on the additional steps we can take to ensure the alliance remains prepared for any challenge.

In case you missed that, he concluded his answer to a follow-up question with: “I look forward to, you know, the consultations that we’ll have when I see [our European partners] next week.”

So Russian armor is rolling into Ukraine, but we’re not going to do anything until next week. And then we’re not going to do something, we’re going to “focus on additional steps we can take,” i.e., we’re going talk about what we might do. And those steps won’t even be about taking actions. They will be about “ensuring we remain prepared” in the unlikely event that we decide to do something sometime in the future.

So no—no strategy there, either.

After the press conference, there was a lot of talk about Obama’s tan suit, which made him look small, tired, grey, washed out, and unserious. So it was a perfect sartorial choice.

It is the president’s job—in fact, it is his primary job—to choose strategies for countering the various threats that arise around the world. In the case of Ukraine and the Islamic State, he’s had months to think about it and weigh options. Russia annexed Crimea in March, and ISIS overran Mosul in early June, nearly three months ago. But instead Obama spent his time golfing and fundraising and downplaying the threats, so that only now is he beginning the task of thinking about them.

The Constitution allows Congress to remove a president for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Does that allow us to remove him for simple abdication of the responsibilities of his office? Certainly, Congress needs to begin taking these issues in its own hands and doing as much as they can to lay down markers for what they think the president ought to do. But for better or worse, in our system they have little power to force the commander-in-chief’s hand.

If only it were so simple to borrow the executive authority he has dropped, because someone needs to address our foreign policy crises if the man elected to the job won’t do it.

Russia’s Leader Is Neither A Realist Nor A Nationalist,"Americans have been grasping to find explanations for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s serial aggressions in Europe. We keep searching for bumper stickers we can understand, so we gravitate to simple explanations like “geopolitics” or “nationalism,” not least because such notions promise solutions. (If it’s about geopolitics, cutting a deal with Putin will stop this; if it’s about nationalism, it’ll burn itself out when Putin has recaptured enough ethnic Russians around his borders.)

And, of course, there’s always “realism.” In this month’s Foreign Affairs, John Mearsheimer argues the Russo-Ukraine war is basically the West’s fault. (We expanded NATO, we supported the Maidan protesters, we were generally just mean to Russia, etc.) It’s a classic Mearsheimer piece: a beautifully-written, attention-seeking exercise that insists on the brilliance of realists while bucking the innate moral sense of most normal human beings. (Consider, for example, his 1993 Deep Thoughts about how maybe it would be good for Ukraine and Germany to develop active nuclear weapons programs.)

That doesn’t mean I disagree with the overall evaluation that America’s Russia policy since 1992—insofar as we’ve had one—has been remarkably obtuse. (That pretty much describes most of our foreign policy since the end of the Cold War, but I will not digress here.) I, too, objected to expanding NATO, deplored the arrogance of people like Madeleine Albright, and lamented the repeated lost opportunities to bring Moscow closer to the Western family to which it belongs by both heritage and history.

Very little of what’s happened in the past 20 years, however, has much to do with what’s going on in Ukraine right now. And nothing excuses Russia’s war against a peaceful neighbor, especially not arid theories of realism or flawed historical analogies.

Putin is not a realist: very few national leaders are. Realism is much loved by political scientists, but actual nations almost never practice it. Nor is Putin a nationalist: indeed, he hardly seems to understand the concept, or he would not have embarked on his current path.

A Man of the Soviet Union

To understand Putin’s wars, from Georgia to Ukraine, the key is to understand the final two decades of the Soviet Union, not the first two decades of the new Russia. That is, to understand Putin it’s necessary to understand him for what he is on his own terms: he is what Russians call a sovok, a “Soviet guy,” a man of the old Soviet Union, a product of “The System.”

Putin is what Russians call a sovok, a ‘Soviet guy,’ a man of the old Soviet Union.

Like others of his generation, he is part of a cadre of men who came of age in a massive, multinational, nuclear-armed superstate in the early 1970s. The faceless cogs who made this system work were unremarkable people like Putin, trained in ideology and imbued with the false faith that the USSR’s greatest days were yet to come.

In their later years, these men have experienced the normal anxieties and embarrassments of middle age. (In Putin’s case, she’s a gymnast young enough to be his daughter.) But middle age for the sovoks also brought many to realize they spent their lives serving a state based on lies and held together almost entirely by force.

So spend a moment imagining the better time for which these men yearn.

The Good Old USSR Days

Go back about 40 years. In 1975, America was on the ropes. The U.S. military had been driven from Saigon. Our economy, deprived of oil, was in a shambles. Our Constitution seemingly had failed us, leaving the White House occupied by a president for whom no one had voted, after the previous leader (one of the ur-Cold Warriors of American history) had to blow town just ahead of certain impeachment. Our military was hollow, our resolve weak, and our alliances in tatters. The prime minister of Great Britain, our closest ally and the source-code of our political DNA, at the time was a man who saw his main task as managing the decline of the West in the face of the Soviet ascent.

In 1975, the Soviets were at the top of their game.

In 1975, by contrast, the Soviets were at the top of their game, bristling with modern military hardware, sporting a new generation of nuclear missiles, and enjoying the prestige of having “advisors” to various odious regimes strung across the globe. It was their time, and the Revolution—nearly strangled in its cradle by civil war, nearly poisoned to death by Joseph Stalin, nearly blown to smithereens by the mercurial Nikita Khrushchev—was at last paying some dividends. The correlation of forces, the great wheel of History itself, was finally turning in their favor, and it would never turn back again.

In 1975, Putin was just 23 years old. For most of us, our twenties are a great time of life: most of our schooling is behind us, our careers, our mature romances, our children and families, all lie ahead. For Putin, that meant joining the KGB, the most elite Soviet institution, and the one that would give him entry to halls of power that would make his fellow citizens both fear and fawn on him.

He would be somebody in the brave new Soviet future.

Not For Long

How soon and how tragically it all ended. For Putin, the 1980s could only have been a painful time, as he watched the Soviet descent to oblivion begin, accelerate, and then end in a humiliating wreck. As tough men like Yuri Andropov succumbed to age and disease, younger and weaker men like Mikhail Gorbachev stepped forward, and sold the country down the river.

In 1975, the world belonged to Moscow. Less than ten years later, the dream was over.

Throughout the 1980s Putin had to watch as the Soviet Union’s most hated enemy, Ronald Reagan, joined forces with Britain’s Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, to rekindle the Western alliance. They were literally blessed in this by a Polish Pope so hated in Moscow that lunatics in the Eastern bloc security services actually took out a contract on the leader of a billion Catholics. As the Soviet economy ground to a halt, the United States experienced a major economic expansion. Imagine seeing the decadent West living better and better while pumping seemingly endless billions of dollars into a fearsome American military machine that bore little resemblance to what the Soviets had foolishly believed was a permanently beaten and demoralized force.

In 1975, the world belonged to Moscow. Less than ten years later, the dream was over. For a man who clearly still feels a stirring in his chest when he hears the Stalinist anthem of the old Soviet Union—and he must, since he’s restored it as the Russian anthem—the 1980s had to be an intolerable humiliation.

Building the Nationalist Façade

Men like Putin are not brilliant, but they are cunning. (The Soviet system excelled at weeding out genuinely creative people while rewarding excessively clever people. There’s a difference.) Seeing the writing on the wall in the late 1980s, Putin did what many older and less able Soviet men could not do: he jumped from the crumbling Soviet state to the new democratic movement. Better to be on the train than standing in front of it.

Aside from some showy moments, we have no real evidence Putin is a nationalist.

Putin made a show of transiting to nationalism, just as many former Soviet Communists did after 1991. Some succeeded in pulling it off, and rule some of the USSR remnants to this day. For his part, Putin wears a cross, makes a great show of his concern for Russian-speakers, and generally encourages Russians to wear big “I love Russia” shirts. It’s a cheap nationalism that really asks no price, at least until now.

Aside from these showy moments, however, we have no real evidence Putin is a nationalist. Rather, he has used his considerable power to build Soviet, not Russian monuments to power. He has funded new generations of nuclear missiles. He set up a Potemkin village to host the Olympics. He scrubbed Soviet history clean in school textbooks. He is obsessed with Russian speakers, to be sure, but only if they reside in lands once part of his beloved USSR. It makes no difference to him whether those people are better or worse off than they were under Soviet rule; they are merely markers that allow him to lay old Soviet claims. In some cases (like Belarus, a shabby little post-Soviet dictatorship) a closer union is merely a costly symbolic project that makes no real difference to either country.

If anything, Putin probably finds Russian nationalism as alien as he finds any other; the best evidence for this is that he has muscled aside nationalist propaganda and nationalist political figures and replaced them with his own cult of personality. He has tamed far-right nationalist groups and welded them to his neo-Soviet expansionism. He has taken one-time nationalist hardliner Vladimir Zhirinovsky and made him into the official Court Jester of the Kremlin.

Putin’s speeches and public utterances tend to show more nostalgia for his Soviet youth than his Russian adulthood.

Likewise, Putin displaced the Communist Party of Russia—a damaged brand if ever there was one—by functionally replacing it with his own Putinist vehicle whose aims are hardly different. (Gorbachev once called Putin’s “United Russia” a “bad copy of the Soviet Communist Party,” and that’s a man who learned the hard way when a party is rotten to its core.)

Putin’s speeches and public utterances tend to show more nostalgia for his Soviet youth than his Russian adulthood. To see the world through Putin’s eyes, look no further than the explosion of bad taste and Soviet kitsch that opened the hot mess known as the 2014 Sochi Olympics. In a display of love and affection for all things Soviet that might have brought a tear to Leonid Brezhnev’s eye, Sochi’s opening ceremony was everything people like Putin remembered about the USSR but that no one really experienced: the dynamic technology, the pretty girls bustling to new futures, the camaraderie of being part of the big Soviet experiment.

It’s all stuff you might miss if you’re a former KGB spook. Maybe less so, of course, if you were the ordinary Soviet citizen in the communal apartment down the street, perhaps scared to death living so close to one of the icemen carrying the Sword and Shield of the Soviet state.

Let’s Be Real about Realism

Finally, if Putin is a realist, it is a strange realism indeed. This is where counterfactual thinking might help: a realist seeking to increase the power and influence of his state simply would not do most of the things Putin is doing. The Kremlin’s foreign policy at this point violates almost every rule of competent strategy, to say nothing of common sense. From the injunction to avoid the needless multiplication of enemies to the danger of letting emotion overcome policy, Putin has trampled all over “realist” expectations.

If this is Russian ‘realism,’ it’s the dumbest realism in modern history.

This is an especially remarkable series of errors because Russia faces, in the administration of Barack Obama, an America that has no interest in a fight and would just as well walk away from European affairs if only given half a chance. Or put another way, America is being drawn into a European conflict only because Putin is too stupid to know enough to keep us out of it, despite every indication from the White House that we want nothing to do with any of this. If this is Russian “realism,” it’s the dumbest realism in modern history.

Putin also shows no understanding of the forces in Ukraine he is creating or manipulating. He has now re-awakened and invigorated Ukrainian nationalism, a notional threat to Russia he could have averted by leaving Ukraine saddled with a large number of Russian voters. (This also is part of what convinces me that Putin really has no understanding of nationalism, and that deep in his Soviet heart, he detests it in all its forms.) Elsewhere in Europe, of course, Putin has reminded a previously slumbering NATO why it exists. He has greatly empowered a traditional Russian opponent, Poland, both in the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union. If that’s part of a master plan, the logic seems murky.

The question, really, is not whether Putin is a realist seeking to enlarge Russian power; rather, it is whether Putin deep down really hates post-Soviet Russia so much that he is subconsciously intent on destroying it.

Back to the Future

Now there are rumors Putin is even thinking of using nuclear weapons. Certainly, he’s talking about them enough. This is all probably meant to give Westerners the shakes, but if true, then it means Putin really is every inch a totally unreconstructed Soviet Man of the 1970s. It was an article of faith among the Soviet marshals back then that NATO was a weak alliance led by decadent Westerners, a façade that would shatter at the sight of the first mushroom cloud.

Today, it is unlikely the sleek and comfortable oligarchs around Putin will be willing to indulge him to the end, but there are still Russian generals who are products of the Soviet obsession with nuclear force. They may be more supportive of such mad plans.

War has returned to Europe because of Vladimir Putin, and solely because of Vladimir Putin. Negotiation has failed because it is impossible to negotiate over revenge. If a wider war lies further down the road, it will result, not from the realism of a Russian nationalist, but from the unrealized dreams of an angry old Soviet who wants to go back and live again in a time that was quickly swept away by the emergence of a better world.

The Simple Lesson We Should Learn from Global Economics,"I very rarely feel sorry for statists. After all, these are the people who think that their feelings of envy and inadequacy justify bigger and more coercive government.

And I get especially irked when I think about how their authoritarian policies will hurt the most vulnerable in society.

But I nonetheless feel sorry for statists when I see them fumble, stumble, duck, and weave when asked why global evidence contradicts them.

In other words, it’s almost painful to watch when they are asked why nations with varying degrees of statist policy – such as Venezuela, France, the United States (under Obama), Argentina, and Greece – suffer from economic stagnation and decline.

And it’s equally uncomfortable to watch them struggle and squirm when they’re asked to explain why jurisdictions with more pro-market policies – such as Bermuda, Estonia, Switzerland, the United States (under Reagan), Chile, and Singapore – tend to enjoy growth and rising living standards.

However, I can’t help adding to their discomfort. Let’s look at more evidence.

Here’s some of what Richard Rahn wrote for the Washington Times about Hong Kong’s economic miracle.

Hong Kong is about as close to the ideal free-market capitalist model that you can find on the planet — which came about largely by accident. …The British basically left Hong Kong to fend for itself… here was no foreign aid and no welfare state — but there was a competent government that kept the peace, ran an honest court system with the rule of law, provided some basic infrastructure, and little more. Also, Hong Kong had economic freedom — for the last several decades, Hong Kong has been ranked as the freest economy in the world (according to Economic Freedom of the World Index). Economic freedom allowed the people to create an endless number of productive enterprises, and because they had free trade, they could import necessary goods and services to fuel these enterprises. …average real income has gained parity with the United States, and it will probably be double that of France in a couple of years.

By the way, if you don’t believe the last sentence in that excerpt, check out this remarkable chart.

But the big takeaway is that free markets and small government have made the people of Hong Kong very rich. Gee, it’s almost as if there’s a recipe to follow if you want prosperity.

Let’s look at another example. Writing for the Wall Street Journal, former Senator Phil Gramm and Michael Solon compare economic policy and outcomes in Ukraine and Poland.

They explain that statist policies in Ukraine have stymied growth in a nation that otherwise could be very prosperous.

There is no better modern example of the power of an economic triumph than the experience of Ukraine and Poland in the post-Cold War era. …Ukraine has largely squandered its economic potential with pervasive corruption, statist cronyism and government control. …The per capita income of Ukraine, in U.S. dollar equivalence, has grown to only $3,900 in 2013 from a base of $1,570 in 1990. …Ukraine should be a wealthy country. It has world-class agricultural land, it is rich in hydrocarbons and mineral resources, and it possesses a well-educated labor force. Yet Ukraine remains poor, because while successful Central European nations have replaced their central-planning institutions with market-based reforms, Ukraine has never been able to break the crippling chains of collectivism.

Poland was in the same position as Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet empire, but it followed better policy and is now several times richer.

By employing free-market principles and unleashing the genius of its people, Poland has triggered an economic triumph as per capita GDP, in U.S. dollar equivalence, soared to more than $13,432 by 2013 from $1,683 in 1990. Today Poland is the fastest-growing economy in Europe. …The man largely responsible for Poland’s transformation is Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance minister who was later governor of Poland’s Central Bank. …The Balcerowicz Plan was built around permitting state firms to go bankrupt, banning deficit financing, and maintaining a sound currency. It ended artificially low interest rate loans for state firms, opened up international trade and instituted currency convertibility. …A miracle transition was under way and the rest is history.

Since I’ve also compared Ukraine and Poland, you can understand why I especially liked this column.

One final point. Today’s post looks at just a couple of nations, but I’m not cherry picking. There are all sorts of comparisons that can be made, and the inevitable conclusion is that markets are better than statism.

Here are some previous iterations of this exercise.

I’ve compared South Korea and North Korea.

The data for Chile, Argentina, and Venezuela is very powerful.

I’ve shown how Singapore has eclipsed Jamaica.

Here’s a comparison of Sweden and Greece.

And we can see that Hong Kong has caught up with the United States.

So hopefully you can understand why I have a tiny (very tiny) degree of sympathy for my left-wing friends. It can’t be easy to hold views that are so inconsistent with global evidence.

P.S. When presented with this kind of evidence, leftists oftentimes will counter by saying that many nations in Europe are rich by global standards, while also having large governments. True, but it’s very important to understand that they became rich nations when they had small governments. Moreover, some of them have wisely compensated for large public sectors by maintaining ultra-free market policy in other areas.

How Russian Culture Enables Vladimir Putin’s Global Aggression,"Over the last six years, we have seen what an emboldened Vladimir Putin is willing to do with his military forces. In the George W. Bush years, Putin shrewdly played the ally. But at the end of the second Bush term when the American president’s unpopularity had weakened him globally, Putin took advantage and invaded Georgia—sloppily and unimpressively, but successfully. Then he hit the jackpot with the election of Barack Obama, who in demeanor, word, and deed demonstrated he had no interest in opposing a revanchist and aggressive Russia. Putin has been clawing back the standing Russia lost after the fall of Soviet Communism, and he’s doing so with gusto: from invading Ukraine to buzzing the European perimeter with fighter jets to claiming the Arctic for Russia, he creates facts on the ground.

But what is he doing on the cultural front in Russia—apart from the use of military force—which makes it possible for him to lead Russia this way? After all, even dictators need cultural support for their actions if for no other reason than to quell bothersome dissent. And how do culture and geopolitical strategy reinforce one another?

Reinforcing Authoritarian Culture in Russia

Recent events in Russian high culture tell us a lot about the state of Russian society and politics and how well Putin is likely to succeed in his project to restore Russian greatness as he and his countrymen understand it. Culture and geopolitics are indeed reinforcing one another, and in a way that is reminiscent of the Soviet state as well as the czarist one. This sad tale has to do with Russia’s academic society, religious institutions, and a national definition of democracy.

Vladimir Putin needs the force of Russian culture backing him, one imbued with an attitude of paranoia, xenophobia, and revenge.

Many people, especially those serving in the Obama administration, hoped for a better transformation of Russian society after the fall of Communism. They called conservatives cold warriors for mocking the “reset” with Russia; they blustered defensively when Obama was caught on an open mic saying to then-President Dimitri Medvedev that “I’ll have more flexibility” once re-elected; and they laughed at Mitt Romney when he said Russia was our number one geo-strategic enemy. But conservatives were right, and Putin the conqueror and intimidator has shattered Obama’s Russia policy.

Certainly, Putin’s initial success was to build an authoritarian state, and he did that by making the executive office dominant and controlling the media and all wealthy rivals. The foundation of that state is of course a rebuilt military, but it is also a reinvigorated authoritarian culture. The culture sustains the state that does the saber-rattling that makes Russia great again, in Putin’s world. Putin needs the force of Russian culture backing him, one imbued with an attitude of paranoia, xenophobia, and revenge. Now, leading cultural figures are giving us further insight into what Putin is thinking and doing. They demonstrate why his country is so easily in his control as they provide sound support for his project.

Westerners Bad, Russians Good

Start with the Russian Orthodox Church. Never a fan of democracy and human liberty—even when it was itself subjected to oppression during Soviet Communist rule—the church and Putin naturally get along very well. Under his regime the Orthodox authorities are thriving.

Everything bad has happened because of Western influence and everything good is because of Russia’s ancient insular culture shaped by a church-state partnership and Soviet Communism.

A recent sobering statement issued by Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, (head of the Patriarchate’s Department of Church and Society Relations) shows just how well. Said Chaplin, Russia needs to free itself “from western models and western influence in economics, politics, and law.” Moreover, Russia should “help Europe rebel against pressure of transnational corporations, American troops, and American political dictate.” In sum, everything bad that has happened to Russia happened because of Western influence and everything good is because of Russia’s ancient insular culture shaped by a church-state partnership and Soviet Communism. Yes, Soviet Communism. Said the Archpriest: “We have a great and glorious history in which, I believe, there was (sic) three gaps—early reforms of Peter the First, 1917-1938 years and early 1990s. Everything mentioned by Mikhail Borisovich—space exploration, the nuclear shield, literature and art, high level of education and science, was created under empire, the Soviet Union in its best years and early this century.”

Putin could not have said it better himself, and these comments are not new thinking. This has been the Russian Church’s attitude for a long while as it emerged from the shadows when Soviet Communism fell.

Learning the Wrong Lessons from Nazis

Next, the Russian academy appears to be returning to its old habits of supporting the state by demonstrating the philosophical absolutism that has characterized the Russian intelligentsia for generations. At a recent Moscow conference on the history of Nazi war crimes (held bi-annually since 2006 in various Eastern European capitals), the Russian hosts kept bringing the conversations back to Ukraine so that they could compare the Ukrainian military to the Nazi occupiers of Ukraine during World War II. We have heard much from Putin and his government about the real problem in Ukraine being a resurgence of fascism that Russia is helping the “good” Ukrainians to combat. The Eastern Ukrainian separatists also make this case constantly, notwithstanding the few hundred “accidentally” killed foreigners when they shot down a Malaysian airliner. It is therefore very convenient for Putin to have leading Russian academic elites make his case even if it horrified the German academics and any serious student of history looking on.

Putin urged young Russian historians to review the Second World War’s causes and to understand that the treaty between the Nazis and the Soviet Union was not a bad thing.

And there’s more. Putin, who considers himself a serious amateur historian, recently spoke at a conference for young Russian historians, urging them to review the Second World War’s causes and to understand that the treaty between the Nazis and the Soviet Union was not a bad thing. His comments were confusing and illogical. He claimed that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was okay because it simply showed that the Soviets didn’t want a war. He said nothing about other motivations, like the desire to carve up Eastern European nations and the killing of 20,000 Polish officers by the Soviet secret police. But the Munich Agreement, he said, was not good because it led to war, just as people like Churchill understood it would. He added that Western historians try to “hush up” discussion of the Munich Agreement.

Of course, nothing could be further from the truth; plenty of Western historians have decried the agreement just as Churchill did. To say one pact was good and other bad on the grounds Putin offered is utter nonsense. Munich was truly an exercise in trying to avoid war, but it resulted in the opposite. It was Western capitulation to an aggressor in the hope that the aggressor would be appeased and take no more territory than it had already. Molotov-Ribbentrop, on the other hand, tried to not only forestall a Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union but also to deliberately carve up more free states and apportion their territory between Germany and the Soviet Union. Both were bad, but the former was foolish while the latter was clearly pure evil. And it was an error on the part of Stalin that cost him dearly. To paraphrase Talleyrand, it was not only immoral, it was a blunder. And never mind that Putin’s current statements are the reverse of his statement in 2009 that Molotov-Ribbentrop was indeed “immoral.”

Stoking Hatred for Representative Government

Finally, there is the deterioration of the Russian public’s support for liberal democracy; they do not understand democracy and representative government the way we do in the West or in many other parts of the world that have been democratizing since colonialism. Across demographic categories of age and wealth, Russians reject Western-style freedom and self-governance and embrace a more illiberal approach. Western models are not what Russia needs; it needs the Russian way. And who is happy to define that Russian way for them? Vladimir Putin, of course, as he did most recently in a speech in Sochi before a debating society that used to be a more open forum but is now seen as mainly a place for propagating Kremlin views. He took on the American system, saying it is not a true democracy and took swipes at the Electoral College, which appears to really baffle him. Such is not new, as he has been doing this since his “breakout” speech in 2007 wherein he condemned the West for trying to constrain and control Russia. But speeches like these take on new meaning when Putin has so much control of an obviously very compliant Russia. Apparently, he’s even coopted an erstwhile critic, Mikhail Gorbachev.

It is a broad-based culture and way of seeing the world among a people group that creates and empowers leaders like Putin to become popular and entrenched.

What is happening in Russia under Putin is tragic. We are not witnessing simply an authoritarian leader manipulating the levers of power to get rich and stay in power (though that is indeed happening). It is more than that. It is a broad-based culture and way of seeing the world among a people group that creates and empowers leaders like Putin to become popular and entrenched. It not only allows but provokes the perversion of cultural institutions such as religion and academia, two institutions that must function well if human liberty and flourishing are ever to be sustained. This is especially true for the academy, which is supposed to be an arena of free debate to get at the truth of any question. But with no tradition of academic freedom or private-sector support for research, the scholars know what they are supposed to think and say if they want to keep their jobs and avoid persecution.

Having once again missed the chance to build truly free markets and a free society based on a culture of liberty and progress, Russia is returning to the only thing it has ever really been: an armed and insular state guided by political absolutism (there can be only one authority) undergirded by philosophical absolutism (there can be only one truth).

I teach my foreign policy students to pay close attention to the cultural attitudes and beliefs of the citizens of any nation-state they are analyzing. I urge them to let neither left-wing nor right-wing economic or other theories blind them to the very powerful force that is culture, for it is exceedingly determinative in statecraft. It is determining Russian politics, policy, and statecraft.

No “reset” was ever going to change these facts, and serious statesmen in the United States and Europe should embrace this cold, hard reality. They should also prepare for, if not another cold war, at least a very chilly one that will last until the Russian culture that produces Putin’s style of leadership is transformed. Some hope that the bite of Western sanctions and the drop in the price of oil will shake Russians into dumping their authoritarianism. I would not bet on it.

Obama’s State of the Union Delusion: Everything Is Awesome!,"For those who skipped Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last night—and I know it was a lot of you—here is the shorter version.

That’s right, President Obama’s main theme was to declare how awesome it is to live in the wonderful new era of peace and prosperity that no one but him has noticed.

We are fifteen years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.



But tonight, we turn the page.



Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.



Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service.



America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. At this moment—with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production—we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.

Wow, it’s almost like it’s the 1990s again: we’ve won the big war, tamed our adversary, enjoy a booming economy, and are now free to chart our course into a glorious future.

If that was a bit of a delusion then—we hadn’t reached the “end of history,” after all—it’s a total delusion today.

The air of unreality is summed up in another line that struck me, when he capped off a call for unity and common ground between himself and the new Republican Congress by referring to the issue of immigration—where he has just unilaterally declared a policy of amnesty in defiance of Congress. I can understand why he wouldn’t want to bring up the late unpleasantness on that issue, but I don’t understand how he can imagine that Congress would ignore it.

Or there’s the line when he declared, “We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance.” Doesn’t he realize that he just did that to millions of people, after promising them they could keep their plans?

This delusion of adequacy applies to his whole description of the state of the domestic economy. We had one quarter of 5% growth, and he is declaring that it’s morning again in America. Reagan did that after five straight quarters of 7% growth. Those astonishing years of growth were what we needed to get the country back onto its long-term trend of annual growth between 3% and 4%, after two brief but sharp recessions. We have had no such reversion to the long-term trend after this recession, and there’s no reason to think we’re going there. Which means we have actually begun a new, low-growth future.

As for unemployment, under Reagan, unemployment fell while the workforce was growing. Under Obama, unemployment is low mostly because people are withdrawing from the workforce, giving up on seeking work. Wages are stagnant and there is zero sense out in the real world that we are all living in a land of opportunity.

But the gap between reality and the president’s universe is widest when it comes to foreign policy—which is the only really relevant part of the speech. Obama’s many domestic proposals should be ignored, and in the Republican response, Joni Ernst wisely did just that. (Too bad the rest of her speech was so bland and formulaic.) But in foreign policy Obama has the ability to act, and in fact he is the only one who can do so.

But he is living in a different world.

He begins by declaring that “we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.” But of course, he was conspicuously absent from the streets of Paris, only belatedly sending John Kerry and his crack folk-song brigade.

In the real world, Shiite rebels aligned with Iran just overthrew the government of Yemen, a big blow to our anti-terrorism strategy in the Middle East. Obama’s speech did not mention Yemen. At all.

Earlier this year, Obama cited our policy in Yemen as a model for our approach to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. That’s an ominous comparison, so it’s no surprise that while Obama confidently declares that we have “stopped” the Islamic State, it has doubled its territory since he announced the beginning of airstrikes against it in August.

In the real world, there are reports that another wave of Soviet—excuse me—Russian troops has invaded Ukraine. Yet Obama declared, “We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.”

President Obama declared progress in stopping Iran’s nuclear program. The progress consists of an extension of negotiations on an agreement with Iran, after the previous round failed.

Oh, and Obama briefly mentioned Ebola in West Africa—but failed to make any reference at all to Boko Haram in Nigeria, which is expanding, committing larger atrocities, and announcing its own caliphate modeled on ISIS.

Obama is a man so committed to acting as if we live in an era of peace that he simply pretends that no war, strife, or threats exist. Except one: Obama did hype “climate change” as an “immediate risk to our national security.”

But we can’t say we weren’t warned. Obama once told a reporter that he’s the kind of guy who actually believes his own BS. We’re finding out the full extent to which that’s true.

What’s Plan B For After The Ukraine Cease-Fire Fails?,"The leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia just pulled an all-nighter in Minsk, and they came up with a cease-fire in the Russian war against Ukraine. Almost no one is optimistic about it, and for good reason: it asks much of Ukraine (including constitutional reform) while asking little of the Russians (who, according to Vladimir Putin, aren’t in Ukraine anyway). Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who dearly wanted an accord of some kind, called it only “a glimmer of hope.” She’s right, just as she was right that any break in the fighting that spares innocent lives is worth pursuing, at least for now.

This deal, such that it is, was preceded by a significant Western debate over whether to provide arms to the Ukrainian government. On one side, a growing and bipartisan chorus is reluctantly calling for action, a group that includes members of Congress, Secretary of Defense-designate Ashton Carter, a working group of diplomats and policy experts at the Brookings Institution—not usually known as a nest of warmongers—and even the architect of the original “reset,” Ambassador Michael McFaul, all of whom have converged on the idea that arms might have to be sent to Ukraine.

Opponents of arms to Ukraine, including the usual voices in academia, have raised the specter of “escalation.” Some of these objections are concerned and sincere, while others verge on ridiculous, but all of them share the same fear: that the Russians would view any provision of such weapons as a direct U.S. attack on Russia and open a wider war that will engulf NATO and then the world. (We know this, of course, because the Russians keep telling us so in an attempt to intimidate us out of doing something they actually fear.) In a cheap echo of the old “Red or dead?” question, some of these opponents of further involvement ask whether Ukraine is worth a major war, or even a nuclear conflict, ignoring the obvious point that the aim of a competent foreign policy is to avoid such stark and stupid choices in the first place.

Critics of further U.S. action always ask the one question they think is the Mother of All Stumpers: “What’s Plan B if the Russians escalate?” It’s a fair question and not hard to answer (as I intend to do in a moment). But for now, since the the nervous Europeans and exhausted Ukrainians have their cease-fire, it’s time to turn that question around: What’s the “Plan B” in the case of a renewed Russian offensive? As my colleague, Nick Gvosdev, has noted, this really is the last chance for any kind of meaningful cease-fire. If all else fails, as is likely, what should America do next?

Four Ways the White House Should Respond to Russian Aggression

If Putin decides to press another offensive—and make no mistake, Putin is in charge, not the ragtag bunch of goons he claims he can barely control—then the White House should change course in four ways. First, we should stop talking about what we won’t do, and maintain a judicious silence until we’re ready to announce what we will do. Second, the president should consider a reboot of the team in Washington dealing with this problem. Third, Washington must move this issue to the front burner instead of treating it like some minor border dispute we’ve outsourced to the Europeans. Finally, if Putin heads west, we must follow through on sending arms to Ukraine.

For some reason, the Obama administration has an incurable need to express every one of its thoughts out loud, as though foreign policy is psychotherapy or some global version of the Talking Cure.

Our first move, paradoxical as it might seem, should be silence. For some reason, the Obama administration has an incurable need to express every one of its thoughts out loud, as though foreign policy is psychotherapy or some global version of the Talking Cure. In the past ten months or so of the Ukrainian crisis (as elsewhere, such as in Iran) we have left no ambiguity and no doubt, informing our adversaries right up front of the full list of the things we fear, the things we won’t do, and the costs we won’t bear.

This approach to diplomacy violates every rule of good negotiation, to say nothing of common sense. It certainly makes life a lot easier for our opponents, whether Putin or the Iranian mullahs now taking us to the cleaners, if we save them the trouble of arguing with us by essentially blowing up our own negotiating positions in advance. The Obama administration’s diplomacy has repeated this pattern over and over: we telegraph our own limits a mile out, and our enemies duly respond by pushing the buttons we’ve helpfully labeled for them.

So let’s start by shutting up. Announce that we’re undertaking a full review of all options and leave it at that, with no further explanation for the time being. Let the Russians, for a change, wonder what we’re thinking, and not vice versa.

Get Some Real Diplomats

Next, change the roster of Washington insiders dealing with Russia, or at least add people who can send a message that we’re through with business as usual. The Kremlin’s contempt for this administration is palpable, as is its racist and neanderthalic disrespect for the president himself. Moscow is an insecure regime that neurotically fears its own weaknesses, but Putin and his coterie are merciless and nimble adversaries if they sense that same weakness in others, as they do now.

The Kremlin’s contempt for this administration is palpable, as is its racist and neanderthalic disrespect for the president himself.

The cordial relationship between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, didn’t stop Lavrov from gleefully, almost sadistically, rolling Kerry on a Syria deal. Likewise, our “hashtag diplomacy,” with our earnest young diplomats taking to Twitter with insufferable thumbs-up selfies, produced amused and contemptuous parodies in the Russian foreign ministry. Credibility, once thoughtlessly squandered, is hard to recoup, and the sad reality is that many members of the current American team are simply too compromised by recent history for the Russians to take them seriously.

There are, however, people who could undertake what we might think of as a “reverse-reset.” My guess, as a Russia-watcher—and it is only a guess so far—is that the Kremlin fear people like Secretary-designate Carter, a wonk who can actually make the bureaucracy move weapons, far more than they fear someone like Susan Rice. (Our United Nations ambassador, Samantha Power, has issued some blistering tongue-lashings to the Russians in New York, but this isn’t exactly the old days of Jeane Kirkpatrick backed up by Ronald Reagan.) Such people need not even serve in an official capacity: rather, what we need is a “back channel,” and it’s time the Obama administration created one. We might even find that some Russian policymakers, especially the ones we know are concerned about Putin’s recklessness, have been quietly waiting for us to make such a move.

Start Taking the Ukraine Affair Seriously

A renewed Russian offensive will also mean that we must stop treating Ukraine like a sideshow. There has not been one moment in the past year where the White House, at least in public, has treated Russia’s severe threat to world peace like a genuine crisis. Seeing the president head to Florida while the Russians mass their forces on the border does not communicate urgency to people who already do not take us seriously. Perhaps the White House meant to keep tempers low and communication lines open, but it’s time to admit this low-key approach has backfired on us.

The Russians have not reciprocated one moment of U.S., European, or Ukrainian restraint.

If hostilities resume, we can take any number of actions that are already within our power, of the kind that people like former NATO commander Admiral Jim Stavridis were advocating a year ago. We should reassure NATO, especially Poland and the Baltic states, that we’re focused and back in charge, with all the responsibility it implies and coordination it demands. We could start, to take but one example, by moving U.S. troops permanently into positions in NATO’s east, where they can serve as a deterrent to Russian aggression, a job we hoped we’d left behind in the twentieth century but which has clearly dogged us into the twenty-first.

Finally, we have to be serious about arming Ukraine. This means things like defensive systems for better intelligence and targeting, and anti-tank weapons, among other options. It means making the Russians pay a real price for reigniting combat operations in an invasion that has been relatively cost-free for the Kremlin. (Spare me the lectures about the efficacy of sanctions. Sanctions take a long time to work—if they “work” at all, which is an open question.)

Would this produce escalation? News flash: despite our continual attempt to stay out of this, the Russians have already escalated, and if they renew their offensive in Ukraine, they will escalate again. (To put it in the Mafia-speak Putin might use: if they come back, they’re coming back heavy.) Indeed, the spark for the larger war of the past year has not been our involvement, but our lack of it. The Russians have not reciprocated one moment of U.S., European, or Ukrainian restraint. Quite the opposite: each entreaty for compromise resulted in another barrage of Russian rockets.

If we arm Ukraine, the only difference is that the Ukrainians will exact a greater price for Putin’s next escalatory gamble. This, hopefully, will slow the Russians to the point where they have an incentive to agree to freeze the conflict rather than continue. Of course, this means more Ukrainian casualties in a war they will almost certainly lose. But it is Ukraine’s right to defend itself, and if Putin starts taking heavier losses, he—or others around him—might think twice about embracing those mounting costs. There is risk in taking action here, but as Ambassador Steven Pifer recently pointed out, continued inaction carries yet more risk.

We Need Plans for Change, Not Empty Hope

Of course, the only solution that would truly unravel the Ukraine crisis and return us to the status quo ante is a time machine. As I wrote at the outset of this crisis a year ago, when the president’s defenders ask what we should do now, without reference to the string of astonishingly bad decisions that got us here, it’s like being in a car with someone who has driven off a cliff who then hands you the steering wheel with the challenge: “Fine. You drive.” But we’re stuck with the world as it is, not as it might have been had we done smarter things a year ago.

We’ve learned the hard lesson that the only road that assuredly leads to war in Ukraine is the one we’ve been tiredly slouching along for the past year.

I realize that in the last years of a notoriously stubborn U.S. administration, these changes have little chance of seeing the light of day. But we’ve tried talking and waiting—the path, one supposes, of the new “strategic patience”—and we’ve been rewarded with a war at least some Russia-watchers were certain would never happen. We’ve learned the hard lesson that the only road that assuredly leads to war in Ukraine is the one we’ve been tiredly slouching along for the past year. If the Minsk deal collapses, something has to change, or we, and the world, are going to get the disastrous wider war we’re all trying so hard to avoid.

I hope my pessimism about the Minsk agreement is unwarranted. More than a decade ago, I wrote that I had hopes for Putin as a man concerned primarily with the internal reform of the tattered Russian state, and I believed in general that Russia had turned away from its expansionist past. I was wrong, and I’ve had to eat those words more than once in recent years. Yet I would be glad to find out that my new fears are now unwarranted. In the meantime, however, the United States and the 28-member alliance it leads should rely on some concrete plans rather than wistful hopes.

A European Union Army Is A Terrible Idea,"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker recently called for creating an army for the troubled European Union. Noting accurately that the EU isn’t “taken entirely seriously,” Juncker suggested standing up its own army “would convey to Russia that we are serious about defending the values of the European Union.”

Juncker’s comments got considerable attention, as he is the top bureaucrat in Brussels and his suggestions carry weight, although he is a high-flying Eurocrat from central casting who lacks any strategic or military background.

Moreover, the notion that what the EU lacks is an army is misguided, since what an increasingly disarmed Europe is actually short on is the will to defend itself, as demonstrated by deficits in spending and thinking seriously on defense. What EU countries lack is political will and seriousness about defense matters, not a common army. Since the EU cannot manage to assemble a coherent foreign policy on any matter of substance, one wonders what an all-European defense ministry in Brussels would actually do.

The EU Can’t Handle Existing Military Resources

Just how bad things have gotten across the EU in military affairs has been laid bare by the Ukraine crisis. A decade ago, the EU began assembling multinational battlegroups of between one and two thousand troops to be deployed in the event of crises but, despite no lack of crises lately, no battlegroups have been deployed anywhere, so low is the EU’s confidence in their flagship defense program.

Vladimir Putin’s savaging of Ukraine over the last year has concentrated some European minds, but not enough.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) whip-hand about defense spending has had little effect on the alliance’s European members—nearly all of whom are also EU members—as hardly any of them spend the notionally required 2 percent of gross domestic product on a military. Nearly four years ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates issued a stern warning at Brussels, noting that low European defense spending was leading the Atlantic alliance to “military irrelevance” and a “dim if not dismal future.” Yet Gates’s caution that America, facing its own budget problems, was losing patience with parsimonious Europe in defense matters did not spur action.

Vladimir Putin’s savaging of Ukraine over the last year has concentrated some European minds, but not enough. Last summer’s alliance summit in Wales, in the aftermath of Moscow’s theft of Crimea, led to more promises about doing better, but only a small handful of NATO members spend the “required” 2 percent. There are positive developments—directly threatened by Putin, Poland and Estonia are on something of a spending binge, relatively speaking, while others ought to copy Lithuania’s restoration of conscription to deter the Russians—but the bad news is more substantial.

The erosion of military power across the EU is astonishing. For all its economic and political clout, Germany has hardly any deployable military to speak of, while even NATO stalwart Britain faces terminal military decline. The ability of British forces to join any United States-led coalition is now in serious doubt, thanks to deep defense cuts, while recent warnings that soon the British Army may fall to just 50,000 active troops, the smallest land force since London failed to subdue the American rebellion of the 1770s, has generated headlines.

Arguments for a European Army Lack Merit

There are arguments in favor of a European Army, and they are not new. At the onset of the Cold War, Paris in particular was worried about rearming a recently defeated West Germany, which the Americans wanted, and pushed for a unified military for Western Europe—de facto under French control, of course. Unsurprisingly, the project went nowhere when British and West German politicians realized the real objective behind any European Army, while the Americans were skeptical a from the start.

National frictions will endure, no matter how Europe organizes defense.

Certainly, developing common defense initiatives to save money on research and development and acquisition programs is commendable, but this is already happening and does not require a European Army. Most big-ticket items being purchased by EU militaries are already pan-European projects. A dozen European armies use the German Leopard 2 battle tank, while most leading EU air forces fly the Eurofighter Typhoon.

Moreover, creating a European Army, with national units no larger than battalions, does not guarantee any more coherent defense or security policy. National frictions will endure, no matter how Europe organizes defense. Here history is instructive. Multinational militaries are fragile things by nature, and require delicate political handling, not to mention that common threat pictures can be hard to come by.

For centuries, the Habsburg Empire managed one of Europe’s largest military machines, drawn from a dozen ethnic groups. While that fissiparous force held together down to the end of World War I in the autumn of 1918, it was not always efficient nor effective, despite important exceptions, and backbiting among ethnic groups was a perennial problem for Vienna. Worse, it’s hard to see how the twenty-first century EU, which has difficulty maintaining minimal political coherence in peacetime, would stand up to the rigors of even the smallest war, much less a major struggle against a resurgent Russia.

Individual Countries Need to Man Up on Defense

What Europe needs is seriousness about defense. While countries on the EU’s eastern frontier, who suffered under Soviet domination, have woken up to the new era of threats to the continent, many others have not. The Netherlands, which once had more than 400 modern Leopard 2 tanks, decided to take them out of service back in 2011, selling most of them off, since how could the Dutch Army ever need tanks again? Such short-term thinking, amounting to a kind of strategic stupidity, is a luxury a Europe that wants to survive can no longer afford.

Creating a European Army is a bad idea that would waste scarce EU defense cash on lavish headquarters and well-catered meetings, which are Brussels’ real acumen, so Juncker’s suggestion has generated much discussion. Moscow is no doubt excited, since for decades the Kremlin liked the idea of a European Army, which would not be under NATO (read: American) control, and such viewpoints still exist. Indeed, they are getting louder by the day in places like Germany.

The answer to Europe’s growing defense shortfall isn’t a European Army, it’s funding the armies European countries already have adequately, which means taking defense seriously again.

We Need To Make Adoption Easier,"Some names have been changed to protect the privacy of adopted families.

As soon as #shoutyourabortion started trending, another hashtag surfaced: #shoutyouradoption. Adoption is a fantastic way to save a child, grow a family, and come alongside a mother who may be unsure or afraid of the way forward. But successful adoptions—especially international ones—typically require years of waiting, mountains of paperwork, and exorbitant amounts of patience and finances before families can bring their child home. It shouldn’t be that way.

According to UNICEF, more than 130 million children in the world today have lost one or both parents. Marie and David Friess wanted to parent one of those children and, after one failed domestic adoption, began the process of adopting in Rwanda. In 2012, after waiting three years, they were finally matched with—or referred, in adoption lingo—a child. (Although Rwanda officially closed its program in 2010, one year after the Friess family began, they allowed families who had already started the process to continue.) Five months later, the Rwandan government determined the 13 referred adoptions that existed within the program would be permanently frozen and those children would be adopted domestically. After looking for more than a year, the Rwandan government has yet to successfully find a local family for the child who remains in an orphanage, despite being referred to the Friesses.

Stories like this showcase one of the many reasons international adoption (IA) has, according to the U.S. State Department, dropped nearly 60 percent from 22,991 adoptions in 2004 to 9,319 last year. Other contributors include a slowed economy, an increase in domestic adoptions and special needs and older children available for adoption, and a concerted effort to crack down on fraud and corruption—the selling or trafficking of babies and children.

Following a trend of baby selling and kidnapping scandals, in 2008, the United States entered into the Hague Adoption Convention, an agreement meant to establish safeguards to ensure adoptions are above-board. Hague applies to adoptions between the United States and the other countries that have joined the agreement. Not every country has, and the differences between signers and non-signers is vast. In Hague countries, a central authority and database exists. The government investigates the background of every orphanage and child to create accountability and a single standard.

Dave Wood, the international director of adoptions for Lifeline Children’s Services, an Alabama-based nonprofit, says that while Hague might slow adoptions down, it “serves a wonderful purpose” and he wishes “every country had a Hague standard.” The alternative, he says, is worse: Non-Hague countries are fraught with opportunities for lying and bribery. For the last three years, Americans have adopted most children internationally from China and Ethiopia. Of the five countries Americans most often adopt from, only China practices Hague. In March 2011, Ethiopia decreased its adoptions almost 90 percent in an effort to reduce rampant fraud.

Stuck: Between a Parent and Child

To adopt internationally, it takes an average of anywhere from 79 days (in Madagascar) to 694 (in Chile), and the average wait is two years, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2011 “Annual Report on Intercountry Adoption.” Nearly every family experiences hefty expenses. Adoption Service Providers (ASPs) reported “charging between zero dollars and $64,357 for all adoption services, with half charging less than $26,559.50 and half charging more.”

Children often languish in orphanages while they wait for a domestic program to accelerate.

Unfortunately, the Friesses, who moved on from the Rwanda program only to experience another failed adoption in the Ukraine, now hope to adopt a child in China. Marie thinks that, despite all the good they do, organizations like UNICEF “[are] a huge hurdle to the completion of adoptions” because they have pushed “sending countries to stop selling, or giving away, our most precious resources.”

While she believes a domestic option is the best and should be the first choice, many times it’s to the detriment of children who languish in orphanages while they wait for a domestic program to accelerate.

Africa: The Wild West

Another piece that complicates the adoption puzzle is that every country, beyond whether they’re Hague or not, handles the legal, social, and financial aspects of adoption differently. In Ukraine, all adoptions are “blind,” meaning parents don’t even know what the child looks like until they arrive. China is Hague, and Wood describes their program this way: “If the government says you are going to receive your child at 2:00 p.m. on a Friday, the doors will open at 1:59, and you will have your child in your arms at 2:00 p.m.”

Its faltering economy, corrupt government, and culture combine to make Africa a different experience altogether.

Africa however, is another story. Because there are many non-Hague countries on this continent, there are few reliable statistics about the number of completed or disrupted adoptions, but struggling economies, corrupt governments, and culture differences combine to make much of Africa a different experience altogether.

While Americans adopt children throughout Africa with few hurdles, many people, like Jessica and Zach Mansfield, experience a whirlwind of problems. Through a large, reputable adoption agency in the United States, Jessica and Zach received referrals for two (unrelated) children in Uganda. Upon arriving, they met their first child and experienced a smooth transition.

Excited to meet their second child who would soon complete their family, Jessica recalls, “L was quick to run to us, hug us, and immediately began calling us ‘mommy’ and ‘daddy.’” They spoke with L’s birth mother through a translator, and she urged Jessica and Zach to love her as their own flesh and blood. In an ideal adoption, the Mansfields would meet with a local judge who would review their case and allow them to “pass court.” In some countries like Ethiopia, families might return to the United States to wait for the U.S. Embassy to complete a visa, then make another trip to retrieve their child. In Uganda, though, the Mansfields hoped to return the United States with their child and finalize the adoption here.

Unfortunately, during their first court visit, which had already been delayed a week since they’d arrived in Uganda, the judge sensed something amiss and demanded the birth father—whom the birth mother claimed had been absent since birth—consent to the adoption before anything further could proceed.

‘Our family at home had no advice for us. Our agency had no advice. We were all alone in Uganda, with no help, no guidance.’

Although it’s unusual to demand the consent of an absent birth father, Jessica and Zach agreed to pay a large sum of money to help the birthmother find the father so they could proceed. Jessica remembers how they felt: “All along, L was in our custody, bonding with us and with our new daughter. We fit so perfectly as a family, but my husband and I had a terrible feeling that something was going wrong. Our family at home had no advice for us. Our agency had no advice. We were all alone in Uganda, with no help, no guidance. Plus we were running out of money due to the unexpected expenses.”

After a month passed, it finally became clear that a man L had been calling “uncle” was actually her birth father and had been in front of them all along. The birthmother’s pastor had coerced the couple into putting their daughter up for adoption, convincing them that once their daughter had traveled to the United States they would be able to retrieve visas and their daughter. That would be small sacrifice to obtain the American Dream.

Jessica Mansfield thinks this experience is due in part to cultural differences: “I don’t think we will truly understand the desperation and vulnerability these people feel. We come in with all these good intentions about rescuing these children and we overlook the fact that there are people making a profit off these vulnerabilities. These countries see it as a business. Westerners see it as an emotional calling.” If a family doesn’t already have a referral, she recommends they don’t look into adopting in Uganda because there is “so much to be lost through this process.”

‘I don’t think we will truly understand the desperation and vulnerability these people feel.’

Freda Luzinda worked as an adoptions officer at the U.S. Embassy in Uganda for two years, and ultimately left because of the amount of adoption fraud she witnessed—not unlike the Mansfields’ story. She said the biggest preventable IA problem in African countries is fraud. “Most children that are adopted are not genuine orphans at all.” She says child laundering—children illegally taken from their parents through coercion and false pretenses—occurs often, in addition to pressure from Congress to process adoptions regardless of the situation.

The Road Home

It’s easy to read stories like the Mansfields’ and Friesses’ and blame an agency or foreign country. Before changes can be made in countries in Africa, Wood thinks one of the best ways to make international adoptions easier is to start at home. “Everything about adoption boils down to expectations,” Wood said. Marie Friess also believes families should be more intentional and gather as much information as possible before they are even referred a child.

Marie Friess also believes families should be more intentional and gather as much information as possible before they are even referred a child.

“Families have a lack of knowledge going into IA about the complexities of adoption within the sending country, the significance of political actions and undercurrents on the future of IA worldwide,” she said.

For example, said Wood, “Many adoptive parents treat another country like a grocery store and the child like a gallon of milk. Even for these third-world countries, their children are their greatest commodity.” He described a recent trip to Uganda where he met with the two judges who were approving all the adoption cases in Kampala, the capitol. The judges are generally pro-adoption, but few ASPs file post-placement reports, so there’s little evidence children are thriving. It’s a common belief among Ugandans that Americans adopt a Ugandan child to harvest his organs for a sick sibling.

ASPs have a duty, as Luzinda describes it, “to keep their eye on the ball by making the needs of the children first and foremost. She encourages agencies to “make sure all reasonable attempts at family preservation and reunification…are made before jumping to adoption. Finding families for children, not the other way round.”

Wood says one of the ways Lifeline does this is to work closely with homes or orphanages to ensure the children there need new homes. They employ nationals and attorneys in each country who investigate families before Lifeline considers including them in their database. Families looking to adopt need to research their ASP to see how they receive information about orphans from homes in respective countries.

The need for these families to find friends, family, and church support cannot be overstated.

If knowledge is the best tool pre-placement, community seems to be the sharpest weapon after the battle to adopt has taken place. For many families, another battle begins at this point. Like the baby blues or postpartum depression many women experience after giving birth, according to PAC—Pre-Adoption, Post-Adoption, Permanency Advice and Counseling—in England, “60% of adoptive parents experience post-placement blues.” Feelings of sadness, anger, and disillusionment can occur within families who have completed a smooth adoption. These can compound if the process felt more difficult than expected. The need for these families to find friends, family, and church support cannot be overstated.

Tapestry, a volunteer-based adoption ministry of Irving Bible Church in Texas, began seven years ago with 20 people who wanted local churches to help people going through the adoption or foster care process. With the motto “inform, equip, encourage,” Tapestry embraces a different emphasis than most adoption ministries: They don’t recruit people to adopt. They focus on the “back-end” of the adoption process.

Now, 1,500 people—20 percent of whom are “unchurched”—annually take advantage of informative classes that show people what Michael Monroe, a member of the Tapestry leadership team, describes as “how to wait well.” Their website, Empower to Commit, partners with the Institute of Child Development and offers a free online study guide with parenting tools.

While Monroe, an attorney and adopted dad himself, thinks adoption represents a great metaphor for God’s love for humanity and the salvation He offers through Jesus Christ, he thinks many Christians misunderstand the picture. “We cut the metaphor short if we just look at bringing the child in. Healing is part of the process and the picture of God’s love. We have to be more complete. At Tapestry, we strive to provide that.”

"No, Obama Critics Don’t Admire Vladimir Putin","The new vogue on the left is to accuse anyone who criticizes our current mess of a foreign policy of being “almost treasonous.” My colleague David Harsanyi dispatches this claim rather nicely. Then again, we’re so old we remember when dissent was patriotic.

But there’s another aspect to this claim. Obama’s apologists accuse us of being Vladimir Putin’s apologists. They accuse us of admiring the Russian ruler and taking him as a model for what a real, assertive, manly foreign policy would be. This is equally ridiculous. By this standard, Winston Churchill was a Nazi sympathizer for pointing out how Neville Chamberlain was letting Adolf Hitler eat him for breakfast.

To make things clear, just because we think Obama is an abject failure doesn’t mean we think Putin is a model of success. And saying that he looks strong and decisive by comparison to the man currently in the Oval Office—well, let’s just say that Obama has set a pretty low bar.

To be sure, admiration of Putin enjoys currency among a certain faction of the Right. Angelo Codevilla goes about as far as you can reasonably go in praising the effectiveness of Putin’s policy, though I find him a little too interested in using Putin to score points against the “neoconservatives,” by which he means George W. Bush. And you’ll hear much more open admiration, not just of Putin’s means but of his ends, among the kind of people who are dogmatic supporters of Donald Trump. They hope we can Make America Great Again in much the same way Putin has Made Russia Great Again.

Except that he hasn’t. Vladimir Putin may be assertive and decisive, in his own malevolent way, but he has not been promoting Russia’s national interests. He has been promoting his own twisted goals, which are very different.

Putin may be assertive, but he has not been promoting Russia’s actual interests.

Russia’s actual long-term interests are, in fact, fundamentally similar to our own. Above all, Russia has an interest in having a thriving economy connected in peaceful trade with the rest of the world. The country’s biggest priority after the collapse of the Soviet Union was to build a relationship of peace and goodwill with Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, where Russia had an extensive history and connections—but where it had to overcome 40 years of resentment from the victims of Communist rule. Instead, Putin has started a new Cold War, with most of Russia’s former Eastern European satellites as its staunchest opponents. Really smart move there.

His military adventurism in places like Georgia and Ukraine has led to sanctions and to the isolation of the Russian economy from its biggest trading partners, leading Russian nationalists to attempt to make a virtue of privation. That’s what aggressive dictatorships always do, by the way. They start unnecessary conflicts that drag their countries down, then they try to make up for it by portraying the resulting economic collapse as virtuous self-denial in the service of the Motherland. In Russia, the old adage really is true that patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels.

Russia had so much to gain from integration with the global economy because its great strength is its relatively educated workforce, the thousands of scientists and engineers and educated professionals, not to mention enterprising entrepreneurs, who helped the Russian economy grow and modernize rapidly after the fall of the Soviet Union. But instead of nurturing this enormous national resource, Putin has been stamping it out. He denounced independent businessmen like Mikhail Khodorkovsky as “oligarchs”—talk about projection!—and targeted them for imprisonment on trumped-up corruption charges. This has chased a huge portion of his country’s business talent overseas in search of jurisdictions where they enjoy the rule of law. What remains in Russia is a corrupt and inefficient system of cronyism.

In Putin’s Russia, patriotism really is the refuge of scoundrels.

Instead of relying on a diverse economic base of engineers and entrepreneurs, Putin has encouraged Russia to become massively dependent on the extraction of raw materials, particularly oil and gas. This “oil curse” is no accident. Oil is a favorite source of economic power for dictators because it has a lot of value in the global economy, and it is relatively easy for the state to control, monopolize, and exploit as a steady source of cash. But this has also made the Russian economy vulnerable to the shock of a collapse in oil and gas prices, driven in part by increased competition from America as a major producer. The result is the declining value of the ruble—worth about a third as much as it was in 2008—and the stalling out of Russia’s economic growth.

Preserving his own personal power has also been the driving goal behind Putin’s foreign policy. His grand strategy has two main prongs. The first is to surround Russia with a ring of “frozen conflicts,” separatist movements that simmer in unresolved conflicts. Most nations wouldn’t want a state of constant low-grade warfare just across their borders. But for Putin, the goal is to weaken and destabilize his neighbors. In Ukraine, which has become a haven for Russia’s new dissidents, his goal is specifically to prevent the emergence of an attractive alternative to his dictatorship.

Who would you rather have as allies? Syria, or Israel? North Korea, or South Korea?

Hence the second prong of his grand strategy, which is to build an international dictator’s club whose members will lend each other diplomatic, military, and economic support. That’s what drives his interest in Syria and the Middle East. This has also been China’s foreign policy, and it has been dubbed a “zombie empire,” to describe the way China seeks out the weak and unstable. But who would you rather have as your allies? North Korea, or South Korea? Belarus, or Poland? Syria, or Israel? Venezuela, or Chile? Iran, or India? Russia has the first kind of allies, and despite President Obama’s best efforts, we have the second. I think we’re getting by far the better deal.

The essence of Putin’s rule has been to prioritize power for himself and his faction over growth and vitality for his country, and to cultivate needy, obedient allies over strong and vital ones. Far from making Russia great, he is holding it back from the wealth and power it might enjoy as a large nation with enormous natural resources and an educated population.

And he has not even really achieved his own personal interests, which would also be much better served by living in a free society. Putin has certainly used his power to enrich himself to a massive extent. But a shrewd, enterprising, and ambitious man like him could have lived just as opulently as a garden variety Moscow billionaire. Mere wealth and luxury are not his motives.

Dictators are driven by irrational obsession, not rational calculation.

It’s a great mistake to think that dictators are motivated by a rational calculation of their own happiness. They are motivated by an irrational obsession with raw power, power for its own sake, which they pursue far beyond the point where its benefits might conceivably justify the effort. Whatever opulence there is in their palaces, whatever empty satisfaction there may be in the pomp and circumstance of their office, it cannot outweigh the burden of living in fear, doomed to endless scheming and intrigue.

The dilemma of every dictator is that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword. Once you’ve gained that kind of power, you don’t dare give any of it up for fear that all of your old rivals and victims will do unto you as you did unto them. Take Putin’s Syrian client, Bashar al-Assad. After decades of brutal rule by the Assad family and its Alawite faction, they couldn’t just go home and live out a peaceful life. They have to stay on top, even if it means an endless, brutal war with plenty of losses on their own side, because it’s a case of massacre or be massacred. By now, Bashar is probably regretting he gave up his old ophthalmology gig.

So no, I am not at all eager for us to follow the Putin model, either in goals or methods. That would be disastrous for America and even more profoundly inimical to our values and interests than it is to Russia’s. So let’s not admire Putin, let’s not envy him, and let’s not seek to copy either his strategy or his tactics.

That’s why it’s so ridiculous to make Putin into a representative of strong and decisive leadership, in order to excuse the absence of those virtues in the current occupant of the White House. President Obama has already proven that not being George W. Bush isn’t enough to make him a good leader or advance American interest. Now he’s proving that it isn’t enough to not be Vladimir Putin.

5 Things We’ve Learned About Planned Parenthood,"Since July, a dozen videos have badly damaged Planned Parenthood’s carefully crafted image as a women’s health organization. It’s hard to argue you’re for women when your senior officials are callously laughing about how they lie to women about killing their children, then admit they use the organs of those deceased children to make extra bucks on the side.

But with a fourth congressional hearing on Planned Parenthood’s fetal harvesting practices last Thursday, and more than a dozen states investigating the abortion giant, what exactly have we learned since July 14?

1. Harvesting Isn’t Just for ‘Research’

Planned Parenthood and its former partner StemExpress have argued that using dead babies for research is necessary work. This sympathetic Boston Globe expose highlights how this research has led to great strides in vaccines and other areas of medicine, though pro-life researchers correctly told my news agency LifeSiteNews that no altruistic end goals justify immoral means.

However, babies aren’t just harvested for “research.” Furthermore, harvesting isn’t just done by Planned Parenthood, or just in America. Indeed, it’s a standard practice of the worldwide abortion industry.

For example, a clinic in Ukraine was found to be using 12-week-old fetuses for cosmetics and beauty treatments for Russian women. Reports also indicate that in Ukraine, prematurely born babies have been sold for parts, and whistleblowers who exposed the cosmetics scandal were targeted by their colleagues. An investigator into the scandal—which may have included taking living born babies for experimentation—says she was fired for expanding her investigation.

A clinic in Ukraine was found to be using 12-week-old fetuses for cosmetics and beauty treatments for Russian women.

Likewise, in 2006, a clinic in the Netherlands was found to be harvesting babies at 12 weeks’ gestation for beauty treatments for wealthy British women. The Karolinska Institute in Sweden has been experimenting on babies since at least the 1970s, according to various accounts, and a pro-abortion Latin America coalition may be involved in harvesting, as well.

Things aren’t any better domestically. Vicki Evans told me her dissertation showed a strong link between the cosmetics and abortion industries, and the pharmaceutical industry has used fetal cells for vaccines even as drug companies engage in similarly horrifying practices.

In 2010, pro-life groups raised concerns about a University of Wisconsin late-term abortion program that may have been engaging in experimentation. Most horrifyingly, aborted babies from Canada were used as a source of energy as abortionists shipped them to an incinerator in Oregon. These unborn children were qualified as “medical waste.” Once the media exposed this program, officials quickly shut it down. Similar practices have been found in Great Britain, and most recently in Indiana.

2. States Are Not Finding Illegal Fetal Harvesting—Just a Whole Lot of Other Stuff

Approximately a dozen states have investigated Planned Parenthood facilities. Investigators in seven have concluded they don’t believe illegal harvesting is taking place. However, state investigators have found many other violations of state laws in recent years and months. Court documents, lawsuits, and other information the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) has gathered show that numerous Planned Parenthood affiliates have failed to report sexual abuse of minors—minors whom their abusers often forced to have abortions.

Numerous Planned Parenthood affiliates have failed to report sexual abuse of minors—minors whom their abusers often forced to have abortions.

For just one example: Alabama officials last year discovered a 14-year-old girl had two abortions at a Planned Parenthood clinic in four months. Yet a state official not only told LifeSiteNews that he believes the failure to report was not done with malicious intent, but he asked our reporter to frame the reporting in a way that would put Planned Parenthood in a positive light. This is in addition to the undercover videos from Live Action that show at least one clinic worker admitting this is a regular practice.

ADF has also identified 105 “limited audits [that] have found a total of more than $129.7 million in waste, abuse, and potential fraud in federal and state family planning funding programs, the lion’s share of which goes to Planned Parenthood.”

While Congress hasn’t found much in its slow-moving investigations, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) hammered Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards for how the so-called “non-profit” abortion giant has used taxpayer dollars to offset its spending on a concert, parties, enormous salaries, and campaign and advocacy efforts.

Furthermore, even as Planned Parenthood claims it desperately needs your money, the “non-profit” managed to have “excess funds” (known in other circles as “profit”) of $127 million last year. That’s more than twice as much as a Congressional Budget Office report found Planned Parenthood received in Title X funding last year.

3. Abortion Really Is What Planned Parenthood Does

Pro-lifers have long known Planned Parenthood’s claim that only 3 percent of its services are abortions is totally misleading. It’s not just one non-conservative writer debunking the claim; The Washington Post’s fact-checker did the same, and even FactCheck.org grudgingly admitted at least 12 percent of Planned Parenthood’s “services” consist of abortions.

Approximately 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s non-government revenue that it defines as ‘health services’ comes from abortions.

Planned Parenthood’s representation of how much revenue it gets from abortions is also misleading. Officially, only 15 percent of its money comes from directly slaughtering the unborn. However, this does not include the “contraceptives” Planned Parenthood hands out that double as abortifacients.

Furthermore, as a September exchange between Richards and Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming revealed, approximately 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s non-government revenue that it defines as “health services” (page 23) comes from abortions. This statistic is garnered by taking Planned Parenthood’s reported $305.3 million in revenues and comparing that to amount of revenue garnered when multiplying the $800 abortion pill (which is far less expensive than the $1,500 surgical abortions done at many Planned Parenthood clinics) by the 327,653 abortions done.

This totals $262.12 million, or 85.86 percent of the total non-government health services revenues Planned Parenthood formally claimed in its last annual report.

Richards has likewise been cagy about whether Planned Parenthood provides mammograms. In 2011, she said that if Planned Parenthood was defunded, “millions of women in this country are going to lose their health care access, not to abortion services, to basic family planning – you know, mammograms, cancer screenings, cervical cancer.”

Last week, Cecile Richards was forced to admit under direct questioning that Planned Parenthood doesn’t conduct mammograms.

While this is barely, technically accurate, Jill Stanek noted at the time that the statement was functionally false. “I guarantee no one understood her to say anything other than PP performs mammograms, when actually all PP does is merely write down the name of a place to go for mammograms,” wrote the blogger and now Susan B. Anthony List national campaign chair.

Two weeks ago, however, Richards was forced to admit under direct questioning that Planned Parenthood doesn’t conduct mammograms. “We do not have mammogram machines at our health centers and we’ve never stated that we did,” Richards told Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah). Instead, if a woman requires a mammogram after getting a breast exam at a Planned Parenthood clinic, “you’re referred to a radiological clinic.”

PolitiFact tried to provide cover to Planned Parenthood on this claim even as it noted the abortion giant conducts zero mammograms, but LifeSiteNews U.S. Bureau Chief Ben Johnson set the record straight.

Speaking of care to women: Live Action News crunched the numbers and noted that the annual number of cancer screenings by Planned Parenthood have dropped by more than 50 percent since 2006, while the number of abortions has increased by nearly 50,000.

Planned Parenthood also claims that its existence and government funding are critical to the health of America’s women, a claim parroted by their allies in the media and in Congress. However, the Charlotte Lozier Institute and ADF have shown there are 13,540 community health centers compared to 665 Planned Parenthood clinics.

The annual number of cancer screenings by Planned Parenthood have dropped by more than 50 percent since 2006, while the number of abortions has increased by nearly 50,000.

Not only do these centers—many of which conduct mammograms, and none of which conduct surgical abortions—outnumber Planned Parenthood 20 to 1, but there are also 2,500 explicitly pro-life clinics across America, including 1,250 in the Heartbeat International network. These clinics counsel women to avoid the damaging consequences of abortion, and a Heartbeat spokesperson clarified that there are 413 additional maternity homes, “each serving an average of 7 moms at a time with housing.”

Many of the 2,500 clinics offer free ultrasounds and prenatal care, and more than three-quarters offer courses on job training, healthy relationships, parenting, etc.—and we haven’t even looked at the 250 pro-life adoption agencies around the country.

4. The Abortion Industry Can’t Take Its Own Medicine

For years, abortion backers have decried undercover videos by Live Action and other groups, most recently the Center for Medical Progress. Despite these videos being released in full online, the abortion industry and its allies claim the videos are “deceptive.”

Unlike the pro-life groups, NARAL has never published any actual evidence of its claims that pro-life clinics lie to women.

Yet as ADF Senior Counsel Casey Mattox noted in a congressional hearing last month, leading abortion group NARAL has engaged in similar behavior, ambushing pro-life clinic employees. However, unlike the pro-life groups, NARAL has never published a single video or any other actual evidence of its claims that pro-life clinics lie to women.

Indeed, a Maryland judge was so unconvinced by NARAL’s “investigations” that he declared Montgomery County “has put no evidence into the record to demonstrate that failure clearly to state that no doctors are on premises has led to any negative health outcomes.” He also noted that those who said a “misinformation problem” existed at pro-life clinics “were universally volunteers from a pro-choice organization sent to investigate practices” at the centers.

Later, LifeSiteNews exclusively reported that NARAL had conspired with Montgomery County officials against pro-life Centro Tepeyac, providing guidance that cost taxpayers at least $375,000. That’s just in Montgomery County. NARAL’s radical and dishonest agenda has been seen in Baltimore, Austin, New York, and elsewhere.

5. Congress Isn’t Going to Defund Anytime Soon

Sorry, folks. Republicans don’t have the guts to take a hard line, Democrats are obsessed with forcing taxpayers to pay for abortions, and the funding process itself is a complete mess. Additionally, Republicans who rightly see government’s first responsibility as one to protect life seem to lack a long-term strategy.

Russia Capably Steps Into Middle East’s Void,"Vladimir Putin continued his winning streak on the global stage as he announced his troops will begin departing Syria on March 15. He gloated a bit and asserted they have essentially fulfilled their mission.

He gets to play the hero of the hour while holding onto his gains, for no matter how many troops Putin withdraws, he will not leave Syria completely, nor abandon his new and expanded outposts, nor end cooperation with Iran over Syria. He has made Russia the most important great power to deal with in the Middle East.

This analysis is not an ode to Putin but rather an examination of his latest actions in the context of the last six months. Honest and objective observers of international relations—no matter what they think of Putin’s goals—can see lessons to learn here, lessons about what diplomacy really is and the role of power in global affairs.

Start with a question: Why is a weak Russia—reeling from sanctions over Ukraine and suffering mightily from a collapse in oil prices—able to succeed so well at geopolitics? Answer: Because the Russians know how to calibrate diplomacy and force to play on their allies’ needs and the West’s timidity, all to Russia’s favor. Russia knows diplomacy alone is inadequate to score wins; armed diplomacy is what fulfills strategic goals.

American Weakness Enables Villains

Regarding Syria, Putin has not played simply a smash-and-grab game. That is, he has not relied only on force to get what he wants. He’s been fully engaged in diplomacy at all times and combined it with force when the time was right.

American weakness is a strength and opportunity for a struggling great power like Russia eager to re-engage in the Middle East and take the attention off its actions in Ukraine.

As the Syrian civil war erupted and then progressed, Putin was very likely looking for an opportunity to best the West, as such is important for his domestic and foreign policy goals. As President Obama ramped up his rhetoric on Syria, Putin saw both danger and opportunity. The danger was to his ally and his bases in Syria if the United States tried to take out his client, Bashar al-Assad. The opportunity was a U.S. misstep that might provide Putin a chance to secure his interests in Syria and re-establish Russian preeminence in the region.

When Obama carelessly drew his red line on chemical weapons, Putin sprang. Whether President Obama ever intended to uphold his red line against al-Assad for using chemical weapons, Putin intended to make the most of it. If Obama were to follow through, as Putin argued in a New York Times op-ed, U.S. strikes against Assad would only make the situation worse even as they violated international law and sidelined the United Nations. But if Obama failed to uphold his red line, he’d be showing weakness.

That weakness is a strength and opportunity for a struggling great power like Russia eager to re-engage in the Middle East and take the attention off its actions in Ukraine. One can imagine Putin was hoping for—and expected—Obama to back down. And that is what happened.

As time passed and Assad ignored Obama’s red line, Obama did nothing to back it up. But Putin came riding to Obama’s rescue, offering him a diplomatic way out through a deal he would broker that would collect and remove Syria’s chemical weapons stocks. This was a huge win for Putin and a humiliation for Obama. Putin’s stock was climbing in the region while Obama’s was declining, and Putin hadn’t fired a shot.

The Strength of Armed Diplomacy

Putin had read Obama accurately; by diplomacy he was saving his ally and at the same time showing America’s Arab allies who was ascending. But diplomacy alone doesn’t always settle matters; rather, armed diplomacy does.

Putin created the most important facts on the ground that would determine if Assad would be removed, and if so, when and how.

Over the next two years, watching his Syrian and Iranian allies fail to defeat the Islamic State while the United States half-heartedly supported the Free Syrian Army, Putin determined he should intervene militarily and that he could likely do so with impunity. Cynically asserting that he was engaged in a war on terror, he heeded a call from Assad to come to the Syrian government’s aid.

Putin introduced troops and equipment, and for the next six month bombed the Syrian rebels almost exclusively while hitting the Islamic State barely at all. He created the most important facts on the ground that would determine if Assad would be removed, and if so, when and how. As matters stand today, Russia will be the primary “decider” of all of these decisions and will do so from a position of strength.

What happened over the last six months is that a struggling and weakened great power used armed diplomacy to get its way. By means of Russian diplomat Sergey Lavrov’s constant hectoring of the United States to follow international law, the Times op-ed, and the Russian-brokered chemical weapons deal, the soft side of Russian power made great gains.

Then when Russia saw American will to use force was lacking, it launched its own force. The very thing Putin had urged caution about in his op-ed, Russia began to do late last year. Russia’s months-long bombing campaign has killed civilians and wreaked havoc across Syria. But no matter; the goal was always to be the primary influence in the region’s turmoil for the sake of Russia’s interests.

Here’s a Rundown of Putin’s Wins

Consider the categories of wins for Putin.

Tactical wins: By announcing a troop withdrawal without warning in the middle of the second round of the Syrian peace talks in Geneva, Putin can pressure Assad to bend as much as Russia wants him to bend. Putin can also mollify any domestic critics he cares to (if he really cares about domestic critics of his administration), and he can ease some of his budgetary strains.

Probably the most important tactical victory for Putin is that through this military incursion in Syria he got to test new weapons systems.

But probably the most important tactical victory for Putin is that through this military incursion in Syria he got to test new weapons systems. That’s probably also a strategic win, since the United States and Europe are paying close attention to the capabilities he’s displayed with new missile technology.

Strategic win: Putin has secured rather conclusively his hold on his Syrian assets in terms of air, sea, and land bases. After 40-plus years playing almost no role in the region, Russia is back.

Prestige win: In the long game of global politics, this kind of win is perhaps the most important even if it is the hardest to measure. When people want a war to end badly enough, the way it ends becomes less important than the fact that it simply ends. This is true for all but the people suffering on the ground at the hands of the aggressors, but they tend to matter less and less as the great powers and the international institutions run the show.

So for a great power to be seen as the one that, more than any other state, brought about peace—whether a just peace or not—is a feather in the cap. In this case, Russia is so far winning the feather. No other power, certainly not the United States, is seen as solving anything. And what the United States has said from the beginning must happen for things to be put right in Syria is not happening.

Even if Assad eventually steps down, Russia will have determined when and how, with the bonus of having bolstered its position in the Middle East, shored up and expanded its strategic position on the ground in Syria, and demonstrated what it is capable of doing for its allies and interests in the region. That is what Russia’s intervention into the Syrian civil war has always been about. No wonder the regional powers have made their pilgrimages to Moscow.

Well done, Vladimir Putin, although I hate to acknowledge it. There is much to criticize in what he’s done regarding Syria, but he has done what he set out to do with efficiency and by teaching other great powers a lesson in armed diplomacy—the only kind that ever works.

Why Vladimir Putin’s People Love Him,"By certain traditional measures, Russian President Vladimir Putin is the pre-eminent statesman of his time. When he took power in the winter of 1999–2000, his defenseless and bankrupt country was being carved up by its new kleptocratic elites, in collusion with its old imperial rivals. Much as Kemal Atatürk had done in Turkey seven decades earlier, Putin rescued a nation-state from the ruins of an empire and gave it coherence and purpose.

He disciplined his country’s unaccountable plutocrats, restored its military strength, and refused, with ever-blunter rhetoric, the subservient role in an American-run world system that foreign politicians and business leaders had drawn up for Russia. His voters credit him with having “saved his country.” So do many of his Russian detractors, although they worry he has stayed in power too long.

He is among the more popular democratically elected leaders in the civilized world and, incidentally, a hero to certain right-wing rebels against the international order, particularly in Europe. This is awkward for him and for them, since, unlike Atatürk, Putin has no programmatic ideology.

Losing Vladimir Putin in Translation

But traditional measures of statesmanship have, since the end of the Cold War, cut little ice with Western leaders and the pundits who judge them. We have rebaptized as “human rights” the system of identity-group and interest-group politics by which America is ordered, and by which America orders the world. Putin, who plays by an older set of rules, is cast as a brigand or a desperado. Or even as a madman. After Russia’s incursion into Crimea in early 2014 the New York Times reported:

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama by telephone on Sunday that after speaking with Mr. Putin she was not sure he was in touch with reality, people briefed on the call said. ‘In another world,’ she said.

This snippet has become part of Putin folklore, with the implication that those who know him best think him a psychopath. But the chances that things took place as described are slim. We have a conversation between the fluent Russian-speaker Merkel and the fluent German-speaker Putin, conveyed (to our monoglot president) through a translation, thence (somehow) to a briefer, and thence to a leaker whose goal is to promote U.S. strategic interests, which grow ever harder to tell from domestic partisan ones.

If the phrase “another world” was used, it was likely meant in the sense of “another context”—the context being, as Putin would have seen it, the armed overthrow of the elected Ukrainian government on Russia’s border, with the diplomatic (and, eventually, military) support of the United States.

There is a standing invitation to think of Putin in terms of caricature, an invitation that most biographers have accepted, though there are exceptions. “Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,” by the Brookings Institution scholars Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy (2012, updated in 2015), showed Putin as a multifaceted leader reacting to real problems. Now we have two more new works of genuine subtlety: “The New Tsar,” a biography by former New York Times Moscow correspondent Steven Lee Myers, and “Putinism,” a study of contemporary Russian ideology by the polymath historian and reporter Walter Laqueur.

Demonstrating Loyalty and Risk

Putin rose out of nowhere. Born in Leningrad in 1952 to parents who had lost their other two children by the end of World War II, he grew up in a communal apartment without hot water. He was bookish, with a taste for the Russian classics, and diminutive. He threw himself into sports, particularly karate, in which he acquired a black belt.

Romantic ideas of the secret service led him to join the KGB. This was not, as one might assume, a good career track for an authoritarian or an ideologue. The KGB was, in a sense, the most cosmopolitan wing of the Soviet state. The man who hired Putin in the 1970s, Yuri Andropov, then the ruthless head of the KGB, was the only top Communist open-minded enough to question whether a Communist economy could ever work in the first place. It was his protégé, Mikhail Gorbachev, who finally grew convinced that it could not.

How accidental his ascent seems. He showed little outward ambition.

As Myers notes, spying required “deeper and deeper training in local [Western] customs that often betrayed foreign origins—basic aspects of capitalist life, like mortgages, could stump and betray a Soviet operative.” The enemies the KGB wound up monitoring during Putin’s time in Germany, which coincided with the era of Gorbachev’s reforms, were mostly those considered too zealously Communist. One thing about Putin stood out as bizarre: he told his fellow agents he believed in God. In the KGB of the time, this was, one of them noted, “an inconceivable thing.”

How accidental his ascent seems. He showed little outward ambition. When the Berlin Wall fell, he moved his family back into his parents’ St. Petersburg apartment. Someone sent him to the upstart city councilman (later mayor) Anatoly Sobchak, who was looking for an advisor from the intelligence world. He wound up learning the ins and outs of a succession of jobs.

In St. Petersburg, he worked as a state property controller, then as an economic liaison to Otis Elevator and other businesses, as well as to Ted Turner and Jane Fonda’s Goodwill Games. After Sobchak was chased from power in 1996, Putin considered working as a martial arts instructor. But when his Petersburg colleague Alexei Kudrin signed on with President Boris Yeltsin, Putin went to Moscow, slept on Kudrin’s sofa, and looked for work. Kudrin found him a post as a manager of presidential properties. Putin moved on to become a financial investigator and then head of the KGB’s successor agency, the FSB.

Inheriting a Kleptocracy

You can get a better idea of why certain Russians not only tolerate but revere Putin if you remember that, within a few years of Communism’s fall, average life expectancy in Russia had fallen below that of Bangladesh. Putin did not found a kleptocracy; he inherited one. The ignominy falls on Boris Yeltsin, whose opportunism made him an indispensable foe of Communism in the late 1980s, but made him an equally poisonous founding father for any modern democratic state. “Most Russians have come to believe that democracy is what happened in their country between 1990 and 2000,” Laqueur writes, “and they do not want any more of it.”

Within a few years of Communism’s fall, average life expectancy in Russia had fallen below that of Bangladesh.

Yeltsin “made” Putin, even though the two were never close. Putin combined two traits that almost never appear together: iron loyalty and an appetite for any kind of risk. The zealous prosecutor Yuri Skuratov had leaked compromising details from an investigation into Sobchak’s city government, an irregularity that appalled Putin. In 1997, Skuratov was on the verge of arresting Sobchak, when Putin, then in his job as investigator, spirited his old boss out of the country on a plane.

This act of loyalty—risking his career, his reputation, everything, for a onetime mentor who had already fallen from power and could no longer help him—wowed Yeltsin, even though he disliked Sobchak. Other political operatives may have been demoralized. Putin understood that the Russian government still held a few trumps.

When Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov tried to topple Yeltsin, Luzhkov’s wife’s business came under investigation. In March 1999, Russian media obtained videotapes showing the crusading Skuratov at an orgy. Whether or not the tapes were genuine, the reassertion of political power was. That is surely part of the reason why Yeltsin named the relative political novice as prime minister that summer, then shocked the country on New Year’s Eve by resigning as president and naming Putin to succeed him.

Rejecting ‘State-Appointed Billionaires’

At a time when billionaires spent lavishly to buy politicians, Putin did not line his own pockets. Boris Bere-zovsky, a media oligarch with whom he would later clash, recalled that when he, Berezovsky, tried to open a car dealership, “Putin had refused even to consider a bribe.” As the number-two man in St. Petersburg’s government, Putin built a house in an exclusive lakefront cooperative—but it was only 1,600 square feet, the dimensions of a modest urban apartment. When it caught fire in 1996, he rushed into the burning house to rescue a briefcase containing his savings: $5,000.

At a time when billionaires spent lavishly to buy politicians, Putin did not line his own pockets.

At the FSB, Putin did not move into the palatial office that had been occupied by spymasters from Lavrenti Beria to Andropov. He made their office a museum, and chose humbler quarters elsewhere in the building. By the time he became prime minister at the turn of the century, Putin’s fortune amounted to $13,000. His wife was making $1,500 a month as a rep in a telephone company. Ordinary Russians saw him as one of them. Despite abundant allegations that Putin has enriched himself in power (one sensational account credits him with a fortune of $70 billion), many ordinary Russians still do.

Young men on the make are favored when revolution sweeps all the chips off the table. The natural-resource oligarchs who would turn Russia into an armed plutocracy within half a decade of it defeating Communism in 1991 included men who had been groomed as the Communist nomenklatura of the next generation. With their understanding of the scope of state assets, their control of privatization programs, their access to Western financing, and their willingness to use violence and intimidation, they took power as planned—but as owners, not bureaucrats.

Since the state had owned everything under Communism, this was quite a payout, one that leaders of Western financial institutions were eager to abet. At the World Economic Forum in Davos Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and other billionaires met in 1996 to arrange financing for Yeltsin’s re-election. This was a top priority. So many fortunes depended on Yeltsin that he had become a ruler who could be permitted any liberty except that of giving up power.

Young men on the make are favored when revolution sweeps all the chips off the table.

These “state-appointed billionaires,” as Putin came to call them, were a conduit for looting Russia, and they were too entrenched to root out. But Putin was able to avoid an outright oligarchic takeover of the state, of the sort that happened in neighboring Ukraine. It was for reasons good and bad that Yukos oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who served ten years in prison before being released on the eve of Russia’s 2014 Winter Olympics, became the center of Putin’s crackdown. Khodorkovsky’s was among the most obscene of the privatizations: Myers calculates that Khodorkovsky and fellow investors paid $150 million in the 1990s for the company’s main production unit, which was valued at about $20 billion by 2004.

Khodorkovsky began leveling accusations of corruption at the very Russian state from which he had appropriated one of the world’s great fortunes. Putin saw his own task as restoring to the country what had been stolen from it. In his view, here was Khodorkovsky preening before his powerful American friends, hoping they might help him consolidate his theft.

But no matter what Khodorkovsky did, he would have fallen afoul of Putin. The two wound up in arguments over, for instance, whether building a new pipeline to China was the prerogative of the state or of Khodorkovsky. As Putin saw it, the Russian government could not afford such arguments. It needed to reclaim control of its vast reserves of oil and gas, on which much of Europe depended, because that was the only geopolitical lever it had left.

No More Humiliations

Putin sealed his bond with the public by beating back, with the utmost brutality, the military advance of Islamist separatists in the Russian border regions of Chechnya and Dagestan. Like Margaret Thatcher in Britain in the 1982 Falklands War, he sensed his people’s fury at seeing their country counted among the has-beens of history. He sensed it because he shared it.

Like Margaret Thatcher in Britain, he sensed his people’s fury at seeing their country counted among the has-beens of history.

“We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians,” he said on the eve of becoming president, “or any threat to the integrity of the country.” NATO had, months earlier, bombarded Serbia in order to back a nationalist-Muslim independence movement in Kosovo, and had used the opportunity to show Russia its lowly place in the international order, treating it as a nuisance and an afterthought. This degradation—not any desire to return to Communism—is what Putin meant when he described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.”

Putin has a gift for making the best of a bad strategic hand. But he was not a natural defense-policy whiz. When the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in Arctic waters in his first year in office, he dithered, and refused Western offers to help raise it. The refusal was understandable, given the primacy he placed on the country’s autonomy. The dithering may have cost dozens of sailors’ lives.

Unorthodox Foreign Policy Works

Over time, though, Putin’s unorthodox foreign policy worked, particularly in the Caucasus. Part of his strategy was a decision not to negotiate with hostage-takers, even in secret. In the autumn of 2002, armed Chechens occupied a musical theater in Moscow and took 912 spectators hostage. A Russian special operations team flooded the theater with a sleeping gas and killed all 41 terrorists; 130 hostages died. Myers, like almost all journalists who covered the episode, is inclined to see this outcome as a “disaster”:

Officials refused to discuss how forty-one fighters with arms and explosives managed to slip into the capital undetected. They refused to divulge the formula for the gas used to anesthetize those inside the theater. The Duma, under pressure from Putin, refused to authorize an investigation…. The doubts—even the questions—infuriated Putin.

The raid on the theater was not a disaster, certainly not as the Russian public saw it. It was a victory, won in battle, under high pressure, against a particularly heinous foe. If the price was high, it was not Putin who willed it to be high. C’est la guerre.

A siege just as horrible followed two years later, in the North Ossetian town of Beslan, when Islamists took more than a thousand hostages, including elementary school children. Almost 400 of the hostages were killed in the raid. In his address to the nation, Myers says, Putin “offered no apology and accepted no responsibility. He did not use the occasion to defend, justify, or explain his policies in Chechnya.”

Again, Russian citizens saw it differently: where does one get the idea that terrorists willing to kill schoolchildren are entitled to any such explanation?

A World Power Reborn

Now Russia has re-emerged as a geopolitical power, both through its intervention to protect the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and in its reincorporation of culturally Russian Crimea from Ukraine in the wake of the revolution there. Myers’s account of the Ukraine conflict is one of the more balanced to have appeared from a mainstream Western reporter.

He does not ignore that, while the 2013-14 overthrow of the corrupt Russophile Viktor Yanukovych began with a peaceful occupation of Kiev’s main square, it culminated in armed violence. He does not dismiss as theatrics Putin’s description of the revolutionary government as “fascist.” (The anti-Semitic Svoboda party held three cabinet posts in the first post-uprising government, and armed members of the right-wing Pravy Sektor patrolled polling stations outside Kiev during that spring’s elections.)

Myers’s account of the Ukraine conflict is one of the more balanced to have appeared from a mainstream Western reporter.

Nor does Myers dispute that Russian historical claims to the Crimean peninsula are strong. The historian Perry Anderson recently reminded readers of the New Left Review that Russian armies lost more men defending the Crimean city of Sebastopol in two sieges than the United States lost in both world wars. In the end, strategic considerations were decisive. Putin seized Crimea because it is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, and it was on the verge of becoming enemy territory.

If Myers has certain liberal biases common to Western reporters, he never assumes that people hardened by 75 years of tyranny and two decades of robbery will share them. Still, as “The New Tsar’s” narrative advances towards the present, it gets very focused on movements of money. Myers suspects that Putin’s crowd, and Putin himself, have been motivated by self-dealing and greed.

Corruption there surely is, but Putin’s decade and a half in power has been too successful for graft to have been its primary motivation. Hugo Chávez ruled the same sort of oil-dependent economy over the same years with a similarly strong hand. The result for the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PdVSA) was bankruptcy, not flourishing. The focus on money corruption may stem from a historiographic problem. Putin has made the Russian presidency less transparent. Those who report on it tend to consult international authorities, who focus on such things as financial flows.

Neutral Skepticism about State Assasinations

Myers strikes the right note between analytical neutrality and skepticism when he discusses the high-profile murders that have become a part of Russian political life in the past decade: Anna Politkovskaya, the crusading Chechnya correspondent shot in her apartment building in Moscow in 2006; Alexander Litvinenko, the spy poisoned with polonium-210 in London months later; Sergei Magnitsky, an ailing lawyer for American investors who died in prison under murky circumstances in 2009; the anti-Putin activist Boris Nemtsov, shot on a bridge in Moscow in early 2015.

It was passed off as a training exercise, although government officials denied having known of it.

“No direct evidence has yet emerged that Putin had any involvement in Litvinenko’s death, or Politkovskaya’s, or any of the other mysterious and unsolved crimes that bore the hallmarks of political assassination during his rule,” he notes. Arguments for Putin’s involvement tend to be of a cui bono nature. They involve what a British report into Litvinenko’s death, released to fanfare in January, calls “strong circumstantial evidence.”

Myers never ignores there is a lot of it. (The British report largely follows the arc of his own narrative.) He spends much time on a bizarre incident in the city of Ryazan that took place just days after a series of apartment bombings in Moscow. FSB agents were alleged to have hidden explosives in an apartment building’s basement. When they were discovered, it was passed off as a training exercise, although government officials denied having known of it.

“Independent lawmakers and journalists who pursued the question died with such disturbing regularity,” Myers writes, “that it was difficult to consider their deaths mere coincidence.”

Is There Any Alternative?

Perhaps it is unreasonable to expect better of Russia. The country is less aggressive than when it led the Soviet Union, and calmer than it was during the violent and penurious Yeltsin years. Despite austerity dictated by low energy prices and Western sanctions, Russian gross domestic product is still almost ten times what it was in the late 1990s, and life expectancy has risen to over 70 for the first time in the country’s history. Its mass media are trammeled, even if there is a lot of independent journalism on the Internet.

The ideology that drives Putin, Laqueur argues, unsavory and illiberal though he finds it, is not fascism.

Its party system is anemic. Opposition leaders are harassed and thwarted. Russian conservatism in an age of mass media is necessarily populist, and this, Laqueur writes, “is bound to bring it fairly close to fascism.” But the ideology that drives Putin, Laqueur argues, unsavory and illiberal though he finds it, is not fascism. Its roots are elsewhere.

Putin is an avid and a rather deep reader who has built a worldview from the work of pre-Communist and anti-Communist thinkers, chief among them Ivan Ilyin, Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He has made reading the “Gulag Archipelago” compulsory in secondary schools.

Nor should we take Putin’s anti-Communism for granted. Laqueur has long argued that, had Russia been led by someone steelier than Mikhail Gorbachev when falling oil prices drove it into crisis in the 1980s, the collapse of Communism “might have happened only two or three decades later in a world situation quite different from the one in 1991.” Putin’s Russia is a system of “sovereign democracy” moored between Orthodox Christianity and Machiavellian realism.

Making Sense of Russia’s Views of the U.S.

Putin’s defensive stance towards U.S. hegemony can sound paranoid to Westerners. Russians find it commonsensical. They have come to believe the West is not content to live with a weakened and humbled Russia; it wants Russia broken and humiliated. Are they wrong?

They have come to believe the West is not content to live with a weakened and humbled Russia; it wants Russia broken and humiliated.

Executives at Yukos, the company stripped from Khodorkovsky, got a judge in Texas to block Russia’s auction of it. They lacked standing to do so, but the delay threw Russia’s financing of the sale into question. The Obama administration has harassed Putin’s government over laws that forbid promoting homosexuality to young schoolchildren, even though Russia’s laws on homosexuality are, in general, more liberal than those that prevailed in the United States until the Supreme Court’s Lawrence v. Texas decision in 2003.

In 2012, new ambassador Michael McFaul met opposition leaders on his second day on the job. At the Normandy celebration of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in 2014, in the wake of the Crimea incursion, Putin was “ostracized” by Western leaders, Myers recounts; the Soviet Union’s 24 million war dead apparently did not suffice as an anti-fascist credential under Western eyes.

Myers describes a meeting of Russian soccer-team owners discussing what they should do in the aftermath of Putin’s annexation of Crimea. One asked whether they should go out on a limb and welcome Crimean teams into the Russian soccer league. Might Western authorities impose sanctions on them? Of course they will, another club owner said, but that was no reason to stop. “No matter what you do, even if you crawl before them on your stomach—they’ll do it! Understand? So either bug out of this country or behave appropriately, like a citizen of this country.”

Sovereignty plays the role for today’s Russia that secularization did for Atatürk’s Turkey.

Sovereignty plays the role for today’s Russia that secularization did for Atatürk’s Turkey. The ability of U.S. and other Western authorities to intrude abroad into what once were thought strictly domestic, and even local, arrangements has confounded and challenged those who still see a use for national autonomy.

Putin is one of these. He views his job as every leader outside the Communist bloc did a generation ago, and as pretty much every head of state outside of the United States and the European Union does today: as defending the interests of his people, the first of which is its independence. At this task he has succeeded against long odds.

Since the Ukrainian revolution, this success has come at a considerable price, in both diplomatic isolation and lost trade. We will understand nothing about Putin until we realize that, in the eyes of most of his countrymen, he has been right to pay it.

"To Appeal, Libertarians Need To Get Real About Foreign Policy","Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are poised to be the standard-bearers for their respective parties, and the American electorate is eager for an alternative. Libertarians now have a chance to present a credible alternative to the hawkish and increasingly anti-free trade Republican and Democratic parties.

Google searches for the Libertarian Party soared after Ted Cruz suspended his presidential campaign, effectively handing the nomination to Trump. However, taking advantage of this will require libertarians to reject their isolationist tendencies and embrace America’s role of maintaining peace and prosperity throughout the world.

Libertarians rightly claim trade and diplomacy are more effective at ensuring security than war. But they ignore the role America’s military preeminence has played in facilitating the post-World War II environment of peaceful trade and commerce around the globe.

Free and open maritime trade, for example, did not occur by accident. It was deliberately implemented as part of the post-World War II system of international diplomacy. For almost 70 years, the U.S. Navy has ensured and protected this system, enabling countries from across the globe to engage in mutually beneficial trade. Abandoning this role would only allow the enemies of this world order to reshape the international community towards their own narrow interests, at the expense of peace and prosperity.

Left to Itself, the World Becomes More Dangerous

Russia’s recent aggression towards its neighbors in Georgia and Ukraine and China’s antagonism in the South China Sea demonstrate that both of America’s main rivals are more interested in indiscriminate force than in ensuring peaceful coexistence.

China aims to use its growing presence in the South China Sea to control and limit trade routes. Half of the world’s merchant fleets travel through chokepoints in the South China Sea, which, if restricted, could precipitate a dramatic increase in shipping costs, and ultimately a higher cost of living for price-sensitive consumers. Ceding control of these chokepoints would give China unfathomable power and influence across the world.

Chinese control of the South China Sea would also lead to a monopoly on valuable fisheries, cutting off supplies to fishermen from Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and other regional actors that rely on the waters for sustenance.

By all objective measures, keeping the South China Sea free and open for trade and commerce is in America’s national interest. Libertarians are right to be wary of military confrontation with China, but they should appreciate America’s unique ability to provide diplomatic support to Vietnam and the Philippines when their regional sovereignty is threatened by China’s aggression.

U.S. Strength Promotes World Peace

Calls to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea and Japan, often supported by libertarians, are similarly shortsighted, as they fail to recognize how America’s presence has preserved peace and prosperity in the region.

Since 1953, U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula have deterred North Korea from launching an attack on its southern neighbor. Such deterrence has allowed South Korea to mature into a free and prosperous democracy and one of our most critical allies in the region. The U.S. military presence in South Korea has created a unique partnership between the two countries that includes economic and cultural trade. Without the U.S. military presence, South Korea would likely have been consumed by communist North Korea long ago, and the world would be without its twelfth-largest economy and one of its most innovative technology manufacturers.

Strategically positioning overseas bases also enables the United States to respond quickly and decisively when military force is required. One of the most critical components of war is sustaining logistics line to support operations. Quickly reacting to legitimate crises would be virtually impossible if our military were forced to deploy personnel and equipment thousands of miles from U.S. shores to conduct operations overseas.

Staging forces in Kuwait prior to both Iraq Wars allowed the United States to quickly destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard in both instances. Without this infrastructure, the war may have been longer lasting and more costly. After Typhoon Haiyan decimated the Philippines in 2013, the United States was able to quickly deploy an Air Force squadron from Japan to partake in disaster relief efforts.

Of course, war should always be preserved as the last resort; but when American forces do engage in military or humanitarian interventions, then it is America’s duty to place our troops in the best position to accomplish their mission.

Don’t Throw Out the Baby

The ideologically zealous isolationist might argue that the United States should never involve itself in the affairs of other nations, even if the rest of the world is war-torn or stricken by natural disasters. This thinking is myopic. American interests are best served when the world is peaceful and prosperous. World War II and the terrorist attacks of September 11 taught us that the United States cannot retreat to within its borders and expect the world to leave us alone.

This doesn’t mean the United States should be engaged in all conflicts at all times. The United States should only engage in war to protect our direct national interests. Regime change, democracy promotion, and preemptive attacks undermine our security and foster instability throughout the world—on this, libertarian instincts are unassailable. Indeed, American military interventions in Iraq, Libya, and many other locations have ended in abject failure. Intervening in Syria would be disastrous, and provocations in Ukraine are unnecessarily risky.

However, libertarians must not misinterpret these failures. The United States can still be a force for good in the world, and if libertarians are serious about providing a credible alternative this election and shifting U.S. foreign policy towards a position of restraint, then they must accept this fact.

An isolationist America would embolden the enemies of the current world order, allowing them to reshape the international community towards interests antithetical to global peace and prosperity.

Is Donald Trump A Russian Quisling?,"Earlier this month, GRU (Russian military intelligence) hackers broke into the computers at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, stealing their files. Then, July 22, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, thousands of emails drawn from these files and embarrassing to the Hillary Clinton camp were publicly released through WikiLeaks with the clear intention of dividing the Democratic Party and electing Donald Trump president.

Asked about this by the press on July 27, Trump openly proclaimed he favored such Russian hacking, and hoped Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and company would do more of it to help expose Hillary. This remarkable and potentially felonious statement provoked a firestorm of criticism, so Trump subsequently walked it back—a rare event for the Don—saying he had been speaking “sarcastically.”

The fact that the GRU did actually conduct a black operation inside the United States to assist Trump, however, makes it not so easy to dismiss. Furthermore, this chain of events comes within a context that supports the theory of a Trump-Kremlin alliance.

The Love-Fest Between Putin and Trump

Putin has praised Trump, and rather than reject such praise Trump has returned it, calling the Russian dictator “a real leader” and dismissing his many murders of journalists and political opponents at home and abroad as “unproven.”

Last January, a British court found Putin had ordered the murder by Polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a former FSB (secret police) agent who revealed the 1999 apartment building bombings in Moscow that Putin used to seize dictatorial power were the work of Putin’s FSB. Disturbingly, the billionaire appears be fine with that.

Furthermore, Aleksandr Dugin, the chief composer of the Kremlin’s new ideological synthesis of communism and fascism and its leading organizer of pro-Moscow ultranationalist and identarian fifth column movements in the West, has endorsed Trump. “In Trump we trust,” says Dugin, apparently proposing we substitute Trump for God in the American national slogan. The Russian state-owned propaganda agency Russia Today (RT), which broadcasts internationally, including within the United States, has also been unstinting in its support for Trump.

The Money-Fest Between Putin and Trump

Not only that, there is a money trail. Russian organized crime channels have funneled many millions of dollars into Trump’s businesses. Without these funds, Trump would be out of business, as, in consequence of his string of cons and failures, legitimate financiers in the West will no longer lend him money.

Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, formerly chief henchman to Putin-allied Ukrainian dictator Victor Yanukovych, was himself directly involved in transferring millions of dollars of such Russian mob funds to the Don.

Nor is Manafort the only leading member of the Trump camp with deep ties to the Kremlin. Trump energy advisor Carter Page is a major investor in the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. As a Gazprom investor, Page has a personal financial interest in ending Western sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, a move which, along with recognizing the Russian annexation of Crimea, Trump himself said in his press conference July 27 he was considering.

But it gets worse. Page actually endorsed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, going so far as to compare U.S. support for Ukrainian independence to police killings of black youth. “The deaths triggered by U.S. government officials in both the former Soviet Union and the streets of America in 2014 share a range of close similarities,” wrote Page in January 2015.

Then there is Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn, who had dinner with Putin last year. Such fraternization has borne fruit for the Kremlin, as evidenced by Trump operatives earlier this month eliminating language in the GOP platform advocating U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense.

This Is Cold War II

Trump has also expressed support for Syrian dictator Bashir Assad, who in alliance with Russian and Iranian military forces is flooding Europe with refugees, thereby stoking the fortunes of the Kremlin-allied ultra-right parties operating as part of Dugin’s fascist international. These include the anti-NATO French National Front, whose founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has also endorsed Trump. The National Front’s current leader, Marine Le Pen, also supported the Russian takeover of Crimea, and is being openly bankrolled out of Moscow.

Most importantly, Trump supports gutting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an objective that has been Moscow’s number-one foreign policy priority since the beginning of the Cold War. He has denounced NATO as being “obsolete,” and called for sharply reducing U.S. commitments to the alliance that has been the bulwark of American security since World War II. Not only that, Trump has stated that as president he would not necessarily honor the U.S. treaty commitment to defend a NATO ally if Russia attacks it.

So in summary, here’s the deal: In exchange for Russian funds and black operations support, Trump will break the western alliance and hand Europe over to Kremlin domination.

This presents us with two questions. First, is Trump a Quisling? Second, if he is, then can partisan loyalty be sufficient grounds for members of the Republican Party to acquiesce in participating in a Kremlin plot against the United States of America?",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/02/is-donald-trump-a-russian-quisling/,2016-08-02
It’s Obama’s Fault Russia Is Now A Major Threat,"While I will never pull the lever for a Donald Trump or Pantsuit presidency, I may be beginning to understand some of what motivates a Trump voter. The hypocrisy of the Obama administration, the Clinton campaign, and just about every mainstream media outlet in America was laid bare this week for anyone with a memory or the ability to conduct an honest Google search.

Just as the Democratic convention in Philadelphia was being gaveled in last week, leaders of that party were exposed, through the hostile act of Russian cyber-espionage (and their partners at Wikileaks), to have worked to ensure Clinton had the backing of the Democratic National Committee throughout her fight with Bernie Sanders for the party’s nomination. While the now-marooned inhabitants of Bernieland were appalled at this, anyone without a Pollyanna view of politics really wasn’t that surprised the DNC of 2016 was hell-bent on catapulting a Pantsuit through the glass ceiling.

After clutching their pearls over Russia’s actions, the Left and the mainstream media grew weak in the knees and fainted at the thought of those terrible Russkies. Unfortunately, they completely missed the fainting couch on their way down. The entire American Left hit its head on the floor and now has amnesia about having passively enabled a rising Russia over the last several years.

What Obama’s Russia Policy Hath Wrought

The Left’s litany of denial on Russian ascendency has been laundry-listed by many a conservative media outlet this week, but I feel obligated to hit a couple of the highlights. The Obama administration prided itself on believing every other country would see the light of Barack Obama’s halo in 2008 and change their ways, especially Russia. Upon assuming office, they offered Russia a diplomatic “reset,” because why not?

After paring down our alliances in Eastern Europe and our leading role in NATO with several measures aimed at appeasing Vlad the Putin (a policy Obama is finally reversing), Obama was caught on hot mic telling Putin’s fluffer Dimitri Medvedev that he’d have “more flexibility” to negotiate after the 2012 election.

Then came everyone on the Left’s favorite moment of the 2012 presidential debates, when Obama hit opponent Mitt Romney with that siiiiiick burn about getting his foreign policy from the 1980s when Romney dared to suggest Russia was our primary geopolitical foe. Obama’s “burn” and the media’s rush to laud it was confirmation for many and a harbinger for some that the majority of the Left had no idea what the word “geopolitical” meant and that an unchecked Russia was beginning to destabilize the present world order.

Obama’s reelection was soon followed by an arbitrary red line in Syria that left a power vacuum in the Middle East Russia was thrilled to fill, and by Russia’s not-so-peaceful takeover of pieces of Ukraine. Never mind that a Russian missile system brought down a passenger jet carrying 283 souls, either, this was all just a small glitch in the Pax Obama Matrix. Somewhere in there, Oliver Stone’s latest hero “fled” to Russia after selling out the American intelligence community. It was merely a coincidence that Moscow is where Edward Snowden landed, and Moscow has reaped the most benefits from his betrayal.

Now That Russia Threatens Democrats, It Matters

Throughout the last four years, the vast majority of the Left and their friends in the media have downplayed the growing threat posed by Russia and Obama’s feckless foreign policy as a whole. Why? Well, you don’t want to talk foreign policy and its failures when Obama’s one-time chief Pantsuited diplomat is running for his third term. But there is one way the Left can finally call Russia a threat to America, and that is if they find out the Russians are responsible for an attack on—wait for it—the Democratic Party!

Yes, now that our government has identified Russia as responsible for the cyber-attacks against the DNC, Russia is being recognized for the actual geopolitical foe Romney called them. While they carved up Ukraine, sheltered Snowden, destroyed any semblance of a Russian free press, exploited a Syrian civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, incited a refugee crisis that is pushing the European Union to its limits, and flexed their thuggish muscles wherever and whenever possible, it was not until they threatened the election of America’s first Pantsuit that Russia finally became a geopolitical foe in the eyes of America’s Left.

While Trump is no foe of Russia, such a naked example of hypocrisy (and there are plenty more beyond Obama’s Russian mismanagement) likely motivates many of his voters. Yet in that motivation lies more hypocrisy—you cannot be enraged at Obama’s handling of Russia, then turn around and vote for Trump, who has endorsed their cyber-espionage, praised Putin and his ilk, and even shared advisors with him.

In short, 2016 is absolutely awful, and that’s why I’m voting for SMOD.

What Donald Trump And His Apologists Don’t Get About The National Interest,"A few years ago, I compared the state of our foreign policy debate to the fictional country of Etchasketchistan. It is as if the foreign policy establishment have been turned upside down and shaken, resetting the alignments that have held since 9/11, and in some cases since the end of World War II. You can no longer reliably predict who is going to sound like a “realist,” a democracy-promoting “neocon,” or an “isolationist.”

This realignment—it might be more accurate to call it a de-alignment—started with a briefly opposed and quickly abandoned U.S. intervention in Syria. For about a week in 2013 it was the Democrats, driven in large part by partisan support for President Obama, who sounded like democracy-promoting hawks, and it was Republicans who talked like skeptical anti-interventionists. I observed later that the old alignments seem to snap back into place a little with Russia’s annexation of Crimea and de facto invasion of Eastern Ukraine, which reminded Republicans that they are supposed to be hawks who stand up to the Russkis.

But now we’ve got a Republican presidential nominee who likes the Russkis and their strongman leader, so it’s time to go back to Etchasketchistan for a good shake that will de-align everything again.

Hence, last week saw Donald Trump praising Russia’s Vladimir Putin as a man with “very strong control over a country,” saying that “certainly in [the Russian] system he has been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.”

This is reflected in a wider shift in opinions on Putin among Republicans, driven by Trump’s example.

But worst of all is that this is being echoed and even amplified by heretofore sober and sensible people who apparently feel they have to run interference for their political team. Partisanship can do funny things to your brain.

Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, drew out the implication that he and Trump are specifically praising Putin’s domestic leadership: “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country, and that’s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America.” Yes, well, that’s what we’re afraid of.

Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt took the argument another step farther, tweeting that Putin has done better than Barack Obama at securing his country’s national interests.

Putin’s an evil man. POTUS a good but incompetent man. Putin has served his country’s national interest better. https://t.co/6R2N0dajHM — Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) September 9, 2016

This is a bit more extensive than Trump’s previous claims that Putin has been more assertive on the world stage than Obama (which is not a very high bar to clear). Hewitt draws out the further implication that Putin has “served his country’s national interest.” On a slightly less reputable level, Dinesh D’Souza chimed in that Putin “LOVES his country & FIGHTS for its interests.”

What @realDonaldTrump admires about Putin is the way Putin–unlike someone else we know–LOVES his country & FIGHTS for its interests — Dinesh D’Souza (@DineshDSouza) September 14, 2016

It’s the well-known “BUT HE FIGHTS” defense of Trump, transferred to foreign policy.

All of this is troubling because it raises the prospect that Trump and his supporters will seek to promote American interests in exactly the same way that Putin has supposedly promoted Russia’s interests—which would, in fact, be a disaster for our interests.

If our foreign policy is lost in Etchasketchistan, if everything is shaken up and we have no framework that guides either party toward a clear foreign policy, then we’re going to have to rebuild our foreign policy from the foundations. There is no more important foundation than a clear understanding of what America’s “interests” are, and there is no better concrete case to start with than by examining what Putin has done to Russian interests and what his admirers would do to America if they followed his example.

I have already laid out extensively how Putin has failed to Make Russia Great Again.

After the Cold War, Russia had the following opportunities. It had a significant number of educated workers with skills in science and technology, whose efforts had been stifled under Soviet Communism but could flourish in a free economy. It had extensive contacts with its former Eastern European satellites, offset by their resentment and suspicion after decades under the Soviet boot.

Russia could have pursued a policy intended to reassure the Poles and Ukrainians and the Baltic states and to secure their lasting friendship. Russia has a vast and influential cultural legacy—think of all those great novelists and composers—which had been largely crushed under the totalitarian thought police. Set free, it could once against reach a global audience. Finally, Russia is also surrounded by Asian countries that are former parts of the Soviet Union and have strong Russian connections, whose stability and economic flourishing would help open up Russian opportunities in Asia.

Instead, Putin systematically subverted all of these national interests, subordinating them to his quest for state control and personal power. Instead of trying to establish a truly free economy, he imprisoned and exiled independent businessmen, whom he regarded as a threat to his power, and instead established a centralized kleptocracy. He turned Russia into yet another corrupt petrostate based on the exploitation of state-controlled oil resources.

In neighboring countries, Putin supported subservient dictators who would pose no challenge to his corrupt system. Where strong and free countries threatened to emerge, as in Ukraine, he stoked the embers of “frozen conflicts” intended to keep Russia surrounded by weak and unstable neighbors. In the process, he has completely alienated emerging Eastern European countries like Poland, turning former Warsaw Pact allies into lasting enemies. He also provoked Western economic sanctions on Russia, which, in combination with falling oil prices—thanks to good old American free enterprise—has crumpled the Russian economy.

Against this sorry record, Hewitt was able to name only one big thing Putin had done to assert Russia’s interests: “projection of Russian power back into the Middle East,” by way of Putin’s alliance with Syria’s Bashar Assad.

Take a moment to savor the irony here. Trump and his supporters—not Hewitt, but guys like this—generally sneer at U.S. intervention in the Middle East as a foolish mistake. But what is bad for us is suddenly good for Putin? Also consider that Putin’s Syrian adventure falls into his wider strategy of building a “zombie empire,” a global alliance not of the strong and stable, but of the weak and dependent, a coalition of regimes on their last legs. The Assad regime, a broken remnant that is unlikely ever to regain full control of its own country, certainly fits that bill.

But never mind the details. Consider that merely showing the flag in a military adventure in the Middle East compensates for comprehensively wrecking Russia’s interests at home and in its immediate neighborhood. This fits in with a certain conception of a nation’s interests—an old, monarchical conception, in which the “national interest” is conflated with the preening, chest-thumping prestige of the head of the state.

In a year of bitter ironies, the closest thing to this theory in America is a school of thought known as “National Greatness Conservatism”—developed by those reviled neoconservatives. In a 1997 essay in The Weekly Standard, of all places, David Brooks announced the theory and summed it up this way.

It almost doesn’t matter what great task government sets for itself, as long as it does some tangible thing with energy and effectiveness. The first task of government is to convey a spirit of confidence and vigor that can then spill across the life of the nation…. But energetic government is good for its own sake. It raises the sights of the individual. It strengthens common bonds. It boosts national pride.

In foreign policy, he described this in terms of “American nationalism.” Does any of that sound familiar? Doesn’t it sound like Trumpism in a nutshell? It’s a short step from “National Greatness Conservatism” to “Make America Great Again.”

In practice, this is likely to achieve precisely what Putin has achieved for Russia: a lot of patriotic slogans and blustering adventurism meant to “convey a spirit of confidence and vigor”—and to support the interests of the leader and his cronies—at the expense of the core interests of the country.

The real legacy of Putin’s leadership can be summed up in the way the Russian government encouraged athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs, in a quest for the momentary prestige of winning a lot of Olympic medals at Sochi at the cost of having most of the Russian Olympic team banned from Rio this year, an unprecedented national humiliation.

Beyond the posturing and preening, what are America’s core interests? The core American interests are freedom and prosperity. The central purpose of government, written right into our founding documents, is the protection of liberty: “to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.” So the first and foremost goal of foreign policy is to protect our lives and freedom from external threats.

But the larger purpose of liberty is “the pursuit of happiness,” the achievement of our personal goals and values, which include a vibrant, creative culture and a vibrant, growing economy. So the “national interest” also has to include our interest in an economy driven by work, growth, innovation—and trade. That’s why our foreign policy interests have historically included things like opening sea lanes used for international trade and protecting them from pirates and belligerent foreign powers.

More recently, we have pursued a decades-long policy of negotiating internal free trade agreements—which are calculated to have added at least a trillion dollars to our annual economic output. America has always been a trading nation, and international trade has always been part of our national interest.

Now I think you can see some of the dangers of Trump’s approach to foreign policy. Based on a false economic mythology, he specifically targets America’s overseas trade as a problem to be shut down. And while he’s busy boasting about how he’s going to smack down China and Mexico, Trump has no specific plan for how to deal with our actual enemies. He has no strategy for defeating the Islamic State, only a declaration that he will ask for a strategy once he’s in office. (It is only the astonishingly poor leadership of the current administration that could make this seem new and fresh.) When it comes to pushing back against Russia’s attempt to turn Europe back into a zone of conflict, he seems inclined to give Russia a free hand.

There is a lot that can be debated about exactly what America’s interests are and what that should mean for our strategy in different parts of the world. But the concern with Trump is that he seems to value the symbolic bluster of being a “strong leader”—both overseas and at home—above any clear definition of American interests. What is alarming is not just the prospect of having a president who is likely to be friendly to the interests of a rival like Russia (which is no contrast whatsoever to the current administration). What is alarming is the prospect of having a president who really believes that what Putin has been doing for the last 15 years has been promoting Russian national interests—and that he might want to pursue the same disastrous course of action for the United States.

Obama’s Weakness Invited The Russians To Meddle In U.S. Elections,"Was Russia meddling in the 2016 election to ensure a Donald Trump victory? That’s the conclusion of the CIA’s “secret assessment,” which claims individuals with connections to the Russian government provided WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.

The response among Democrats has been predictable. On Friday, the Obama White House ordered a “full review,” while Clinton’s campaign is demanding declassification of the intelligence. In a statement, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said: “We now know that the C.I.A. has determined Russia’s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.”

Podesta is right that Russia’s meddling in our elections should distress every American. But let’s not pretend that such meddling is something new and unprecedented. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained what it called “active measures” to undermine democracies in the West, including the United States. Sometimes they even had willing accomplices here in America.

In March of last year, my colleague Sean Davis wrote about one such effort back in 1984, when Sen. Ted Kennedy begged the Soviets to intervene in the 1984 presidential election in order to unseat President Ronald Reagan. According to Soviet documents unearthed after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kennedy wanted to arrange a visit to Moscow so he could advise the Soviets about how to deal with Reagan on matters of nuclear disarmament.

He also wanted to stage some fake news. According to Kennedy’s secret Soviet communiques, he would arrange for televisions interviews with general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Yuri Andropov. Through an intermediary, Kennedy proposed the following:

A direct appeal… to the American people will, without a doubt, attract a great deal of attention and interest in the country… If the proposal is recognized as worthy, then Kennedy and his friends will bring about suitable steps to have representatives of the largest television companies in the USA contact Y.V. Andropov for an invitation to Moscow for the interviews… The senator underlined the importance that this initiative should be seen as coming from the American side.

Russian Meddling Is Nothing New

The point is, these new revelations about Russia’s meddling in U.S. elections are nothing new. In fact, Russia’s “active measures” never really went away, even after the fall of the Soviet Union. The difference is, there was a lot at stake for Russia in the 2016 election. A Trump administration would indeed leave Vladimir Putin with more leeway to pursue a revanchist agenda in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. Trump has had nice things to say about Putin in the past, and his foreign policy approach aligns more with Obama’s than Clinton’s: he wants to roll back the post-Cold War international order. Trump imagines a world where America is just another country, not the guarantor of international peace and stability it has been for decades.

A Clinton administration, on the other hand, would likely be less quiescent about Putin’s irredentist aims. It’s therefore easy to see why Moscow might prefer a President Trump to a President Clinton.

But even still, this misses the bigger picture. In 2012, Obama and the Democrats openly mocked Mitt Romney for suggesting that Russia was the number one foreign policy challenge facing America. Who can forget Obama’s debate quip that the 1980s called and “wants their foreign policy back”? Everyone on the Left had a good laugh.

How could it be, then, that just four years after Russia was the butt of Democrats’ jokes about Romney, it’s now a major threat to American democracy? The terrible truth is something no Democrat will admit: the Russians were always a threat, and Obama didn’t take them seriously. Our weakness abroad—in Syria, in Ukraine, in the South China Sea—emboldened Putin and endangered American interests and standing, and undermined our ability to maintain order and dissuade strongmen like Putin from revising the international order.

Russia Has Bigger Aims Than Electing Trump

As for Russia’s motive in all this, anyone who has been paying attention for the past year-and-a-half can tell you that it goes far beyond a single election or particular candidate. Here’s what I wrote in August:

As tempting as it is to see Russia as a partisan player on Trump’s side, the Kremlin’s goal isn’t to see a particular candidate win. The goal is much more insidious: to undermine American confidence in our political system. That is, the Kremlin’s real target is liberal democracy itself. Whether Trump realizes it or not, he is nothing to Putin but a useful idiot in this larger effort. […] The Russians have chosen their moment well. American confidence in public institutions is languishing at historic lows, while the vast majority of Americans report anger and frustration at the federal government. That lack of trust has helped propel Trump, a political outsider, to the top of the Republican Party ticket. It fueled the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders. Now Moscow is exploiting it in the service of a grand strategy, with far greater implications than a single U.S. presidential election. After all, if Putin can convince Americans that liberal democracy is nothing but a sham, he will accomplish what no leader of the Soviet Union ever could. Decades after we thought it was over, Russia will have finally won the Cold War.

Don’t hold your breath waiting for Obama and the Democrats to admit they were wrong about Russia. To do so now would be to admit that the past eight years of Obama’s foreign policy approach to Moscow have been an unmitigated disaster, and that Russia’s efforts to undermine Americans’ confidence in democracy have been largely successful. And we can’t have that.

Ben Rhodes Still Doesn't Know His Foreign Policy Endangered The World,"Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama’s erstwhile national security advisor, thinks the United States is “in a stronger position” now than it was eight years ago when Obama first came into office. In a recent interview with Politico, Rhodes characterized Obama’s foreign policy in curious terms. He said, “A lot of what we did was to restore the United States at the center of the international order.”

By nearly every measure, Rhodes’ claim is demonstrably false. From the Asia Pacific to the Middle East to continental Europe, Obama has greatly diminished America’s ability to shape and influence world affairs. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to name another period in our history marked by a more precipitous decline in American leadership abroad than that which we’ve witnessed over the past eight years. Space doesn’t permit a complete chronicle of Obama’s foreign policy blunders, but a salient few will suffice.

In Syria, nearly a half-million people have now perished in a civil war whose denouement has left that shattered country firmly in the hands of President Bashar al-Assad. Beyond the suffering he inflicted on his own people, Assad’s victory has demonstrated to the rest of the Middle East that America is no longer willing to invest in the stability of the region, and is content instead to let Assad’s sponsors, Russia and Iran, pursue their interests there. For Tehran, now flush with cash from Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, those interests are nothing short of regional hegemony.

Russia’s motivations in Syria, by contrast, have little to do with the Middle East and much to do with Ukraine and Eastern Europe. Left to its own devices by the United States after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Ukraine is now using Soviet-era tank factories to modernize its military in anticipation of a renewed Russian offensive. The shadow of a revanchist Kremlin stretches to Poland, which added 50,000 volunteer troops to its military last year in the form of local defense militias equipped with Polish-made arms. Similar efforts are underway in the Baltic states.

Dwarfing all these events is China’s lunge in the South China Sea, where the Chinese military is constructing armed island redoubts. Beyond asserting control over one of the world’s busiest shipping corridors, the purpose of the buildup is to sideline the United States and force our allies in the Asia Pacific to seek an accommodation with Beijing. Some, like Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, appear to be getting the message.

Rhodes Doesn’t Know What Diplomacy Is

In all this, Rhodes doesn’t see a systematic problem or a pattern of retreat. For him, the world is simply thus. He believes the “nature of power in the current moment” limits how much the United States can shape international affairs. From the end of the Cold War to 2002, he said, “the United States had a great deal of freedom of action… We could count on Russia being on its back foot as we enlarged NATO. We had some time before the Chinese started to try to shape events in their neighborhoods.”

Although Rhodes concedes that America is still the most powerful country in the world, “what has changed is there are other power centers that are going to ensure that there are limits on certain things that the United States wants to do.”

That’s the crux of Rhodes’ foreign policy thinking: he believes the rise of other powers is the cause of America’s constraint in world affairs, not a consequence of it. But in fact American inaction has emboldened other powers to pursue irredentist aims. This has been a cornerstone of Obama’s foreign policy thinking since the 2008 election, when he ran as an anti-war candidate. Obama promised to extricate us from President George W. Bush’s unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to reorient American relations across the globe. We would not impose our agenda abroad. We would not act unilaterally. We would not start any wars. We would, in effect, become just another nation in the family of nations.

Underneath Obama’s approach rests the assumption that American military action abroad is a destabilizing force. Hence, America’s true strength and influence flows from our restraint, from acquiescence to multilateral institutions and “international consensus.”

This represents a massive rupture in American foreign policy. Since the end of World War II, the United States had not been just another nation; it had been the indispensable nation. During the Cold War, American arms and aid underwrote global peace and prosperity in the West, and after the defeat of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union, American leadership stabilized and sustained a rules-based international order that promoted free trade between nations, free elections within them, and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.

Obama set out to dismantle this Pax Americana, but he talked about it in the language of liberal internationalism. In his 2009 Cairo speech, Obama said that although the people of Iraq were better off without Saddam Hussein, “events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible.” In practice, that meant abdicating America’s leadership role. In the years to come, Obama would often invoke “diplomacy” and “international consensus” as reasons for refusing to intervene, even to maintain the post-Cold War international order.

Asked to sum up Obama’s foreign policy legacy, Rhodes echoed this line of thought. “We’ve engaged diplomatically around the world,” he said. “We’ve engaged former adversaries. We’ve engaged publics. We’ve sought to work through multilateral coalitions and institutions with the purpose of repositioning the United States to lead.”

But thinking of engagement in this way misapprehends the purpose of diplomacy and misunderstands America’s indispensable role. As former Secretary of State John Kerry has spent the last several years proving, diplomacy is pointless if it isn’t backed up by the credible use of force. In fact, the two go hand in hand.

Obama has often framed issues like the Iran nuclear deal as a binary choice between diplomacy and war. The truth is, the specter of war allows diplomatic engagement to be effective, because sometimes military conflict is the only thing that can provide leverage for negotiation. After all, diplomacy is first and foremost a negotiation. As Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson once said, “Negotiation in the classic diplomatic sense assumes parties more anxious to agree than to disagree.” For diplomacy to work, sometimes you need to make an adversary anxious to agree.

Syria Encapsulates Obama’s Foreign Policy Failures

No situation better demonstrates Obama’s failure to understand this than the Syrian civil war. By refusing to act after his “red line” ultimatum on the use of chemical weapons, Obama took military force off the table. At that point, there was no reason for Assad to negotiate a settlement. He knew he need only wait. Obama and Rhodes take credit for getting chemical weapons out of Syria under Russian supervision, but that’s a pyrrhic victory. Assad’s ultimate goal was to remain in power, not retain control of chemical weapons—many of which he never gave up anyway.

The price of inaction, we now know, was civilian slaughter on a massive scale.

But Obama was determined not to let his presidency get mired in another Mideast war. In a widely-read piece on Obama’s foreign policy, The Atlantic’s Jeffery Goldberg rightly concluded that, “In the matter of the Syrian regime and its Iranian and Russian sponsors, Obama has bet, and seems prepared to continue betting, that the price of direct U.S. action would be higher than the price of inaction.”

The price of inaction, we now know, was civilian slaughter on a massive scale. But Rhodes and Obama talk about it with an air of fatalism. “You could call me a realist in believing we can’t relieve all the world’s misery,” Obama told Goldberg. “We cannot resolve the issues internal to these countries,” Rhodes said in his Politico interview. Rhodes also repeated a version of the rhetoric Obama often used when discussing the Iran nuclear deal, that it was a binary choice between the deal or war with Iran: “I don’t know how we could have started a military conflict with Assad that we didn’t feel compelled to try to finish by taking out Assad.”

Pretending American military action will inexorably lead to war and regime change is a way to justify the dismantling of the post-Cold War international order and America’s retreat from global leadership. But it’s also more than a justification: Obama and Rhodes really believe it’s true. The logic of their worldview demands that America not act, even when a leader like Assad attacks civilians with chemical weapons, or Russia invades Crimea, or China threatens its neighbors. Unless the U.N. Security Council is on board, America is powerless to act.

At his last speech to the U.N. General Assembly, in September, Obama said, “If we are honest, we know that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist for long.” History and experience suggest otherwise, but for Rhodes and Obama, an America that’s unable to impose its will or uphold international norms is necessary for a better world—even if it means we have to sit back and watch it burn.

Trump’s Team Does Global Damage Control For Their Bombastic Chief,"In his first six months in office,President Obama went on a kind of “apology tour” of the Middle East. It was a mea culpa for America’s “imperialist” actions overseas. His tour set the tone for his administration’s position toward the region and its policy of nonintervention.

Instead of an apology tour, the Trump administration has spent the last week on what could plausibly be called a reassurance tour. Its mission? To walk back the bombastic comments candidate—and now president—Donald Trump has made about our allies and enemies abroad. This, too, sets the tone for Trump’s presidency. But what it predicts is the ongoing chaos of unpredictability.

Allies Need Assurance the U.S. Will Be Trustworthy

Since he was a candidate, Trump has made countless comments overturning the foreign policy status quo. He has repeatedly referred to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as “obsolete” and has called into question whether the U.S. would honor Article V of NATO, requiring member states to consider an attack on one ally as an attack on all the allies.

Trump’s praise of President Putin, along with his noncommittal comments about holding Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine, have made such dismissals of NATO particularly concerning for European leaders. They worry that Russia will act with impunity without the U.S. to back up the alliance.

Trump has spoken unexpectedly about South Korea and Japan getting nuclear weapons so they can defend themselves, and has said that if we were going to go to Iraq, we should have at least “taken all the oil.” On the economic front, he’s made disparaging remarks about the European Union, openly cheering the Brexit vote last summer.

Cooler heads know that our allies need to be given some assurances that the U.S. isn’t making a radical shift in foreign policy—and that they won’t be left in the lurch. So, the Trump administration has sent two of their top men on Operation Cleanup: Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Defense James Mattis.

Mattis and Pence Reassure European Allies

First, to Europe. After meeting with NATO defense ministers last week, Mattis said that the U.S. commitment to the alliance was “rock solid.” Similarly, at last week’s Munich Security Conference, Pence told European leaders that the United States would be their “greatest ally” and would “stand with Europe.” They made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that the United States is committed to its security agreements with Europe, most importantly, with NATO. He also spoke of working together to fight terrorism, something both continents have struggled with since the rise of ISIS.

On Monday, Pence was in Brussels meeting with European Union officials. There, he declared America’s commitment to its European partners, both economically and in the fight against terrorism. He also spoke of a continued promise to hold Russia accountable, especially as concerns Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its meddling in Ukraine. This echoes Gen. Mattis’ comments at NATO headquarters that the U.S. is “not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level” with Russia.

Europeans have worried that Trump’s avowed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin would get in the way of America’s duty to defend NATO member states. On this, our allies require much reassurance.

Mattis Seeks Diplomatic Damage Control In Iraq

Pence, in particular, seemed at pains to make clear that his message to Europe was also Trump’s, saying he was acting on behalf of the president. He understands the absolute necessity of demonstrating to European allies not only that the U.S. is 100 percent with them, but that this is the official stance of the administration. Pence needs to project that he and Trump are a unified front, that America won’t leave its allies guessing, and that there will be no surprises.

What an undertaking.

Meanwhile, Gen. Mattis headed to Iraq this week to assess the fight against ISIS and work on a plan to defeat the terrorist organization. U.S.-Iraq relations, however, have soured recently, largely over Trump’s executive order that temporarily banned travel to the U.S. from seven countries, including Iraq, our ally in the region. This gave Mattis more to do than just strategize. He also had to do diplomatic damage control. On Monday, he said that the U.S. is not in Iraq “to seize anybody’s oil” and reassured Iraqis that it’s his understanding that any future executive order on immigration would include a provision for Iraqis who have served with the U.S. military.

Tillerson Will Now Be Put to the Test

But it’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who will bear the bulk of the load trying to walk back Trump’s off-the-cuff foreign policy. Although generally keeping a low profile, Tillerson met last week for the first time with his counterparts at the G20 summit in Germany, reportedly leaving them relieved to find him a serious man. Foreign ministers from several countries were cautiously encouraged that Tillerson seemed open to diplomacy and wasn’t just interested in the use of military force. Tillerson, like Mattis and Pence, found it necessary to reaffirm U.S. commitment to a cessation of hostilities in eastern Ukraine before lifting sanctions against Russia.

Most diplomats, defense secretaries, and secretaries of state spend their time finding common ground between the U.S. and foreign powers and repairing cracks in those relationships. But usually those cracks aren’t directly caused by the President.

One comment from a senior EU diplomat showcases perfectly the difficult position in which Trump administration officials find themselves. He said he was reassured by Pence’s comments in Brussels, but that such statements are only credible “until the next tweet” from Trump. He is right. No one, not even his second in command, knows what Trump will do next.

Will Trump’s Drive-by Policymaking Hurt America?

For Trump’s foreign-policy surrogates, it must be like trying to walk up an escalator that’s going down. No matter how quickly they step, they can’t seem to make any progress. At some point, their credibility will begin to be damaged. And that’s a dangerous proposition.

Throughout the presidential race and during the transition period, Republicans like Reince Priebus kept insisting that once he became president, Trump would calm down and conform to presidential norms. But that hasn’t happened yet. After all, his comments on taking Iraq’s oil were made at a speech at CIA headquarters the day after his inauguration.

If this continues, Trump’s drive-by policymaking will prove to be a huge distraction for his top foreign policy surrogates. And more importantly, it risks America’s signals getting crossed with our allies and enemies alike, sowing chaos across the globe. Any student of history knows how disastrous that can be.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/22/trumps-team-global-damage-control-bombastic-chief/,2017-02-22
The Hysteria Over Russia Is Causing Serious Foreign Policy Problems,"The fifth season of “The Americans,” the FX series about two Soviet spies posing as an American couple living near Washington DC in the 1980s, began airing this week. The Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus tweeted:

So excited to be watching The Americans, throwback to a simpler time when everyone considered Russia the enemy. Even the president.

It’s a funny line, but when it comes to U.S.-Russia relations, the 1980s weren’t really a simpler time, and returning to the costly threats and risks of the height of the Cold War are almost certainly not in the interests of the United States.

Yet that’s precisely what the current conspiracy theories swirling around the media-political complex could lead to. At the Center for National Interest on Tuesday, a panel of national security and Russia analysts sounded the alarm about the domestic political situation in the United States leading to a rapid deterioration of the already fragile relationship with Russia. They said the damage caused by hysteria surrounding Russia could harm potential U.S. interests in Syria, Ukraine, arms agreements, and the economy.

“There are consequences if we don’t get the relationship right,” said Paul Saunders, the executive director of CTNI. “Anyone who thinks we’re in a hostile relationship now, I would suggest there are a number of things that could be worse than they are now.”

Russian Hacking Leads to Russia Hysteria

The latest problems with Russia stem from U.S. intelligence agencies’ report, widely accepted by those who have seen the classified intelligence undergirding it, that state-involved hackers successfully spearfished John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president, and obtained documents from the Democratic National Committee. The information they gleaned was released publicly via WikiLeaks. The information was deemed “boring,” “honest and boring,” and “a damp squib” by many in the media before the election. After the surprise victory of Trump, the release of information was deemed a national security threat of the highest order.

Various media and political interests (on both sides of the aisle) are pushing for more than the current investigations against Russia. Further, despite no evidence or allegations from named sources to substantiate claims of wrongdoing, various media outlets have been suggesting illegal ties of President Trump’s foreign policy with Russia. This after months of asserting that Russia “hacked” not just Democratic political operatives but the very election itself.

A general air of hysteria has enveloped Washington’s political and media class. CNN.com’s front page on Sunday and Monday featured a large red-washed image of St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square. In front of St. Basil’s were a photoshopped Mike Flynn, Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, Vladimir Putin, and Ambassador Kislyak. Subtle!

The large type at the top of the page read “Russia mystery threatens to consume DC.” Other top headlines included:

White House can’t seem to shake off the Russian drama

Trump and Russia: What fallout could be

Trump’s hidden taxes fuel Russia rumors

President’s own actions reignite a Russian obsession

CNN/ORC poll: Most back special prosecutor to investigate Russia

Russian glee over Trump’s election gives way to frustration

Is Trump’s new conspiracy theory a tactic to divert attention from Russia?

Media outlets are now writing up stories about Americans having ever met with Russians. One media outlet reported that while one Russian businessman and Donald Trump didn’t meet in October, their planes did. Yes, their planes did. One policy wonk convinced of nefarious Russian meddling privately said of a particularly stupid Red Scare story, “One of the reasons we will probably never get to the bottom of [meddling] is our media is populated by hyperventilating dimwits.”

When then-Sen. Jeff Sessions was asked, in his confirmation hearing to be attorney general, about investigating claims of Russian attempts to compromise the Trump campaign, he noted that he was considered a Trump surrogate and he hadn’t had such meetings. When it turned out that Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his capacity as a U.S. senator on the Armed Forces Committee, media outlets and Democratic politicians pounced, calling Kislyak a spy and demanding Sessions resign. Really.

We are in the midst of a full-blown Red Scare conspiracy theory. It’s hard to shake the feeling that the real problems caused by Russian hacking and releasing of real emails — sent by Democrats and media figures to each other — are being exacerbated for political reasons. But the consequences are not minor.

The Kislyak Slur

At the Center for the National Interest event, analysts and experts who worked for both Democrats and Republicans, and at think tanks and strategic analysis firms across the spectrum, were upset at the treatment Kislyak has been subjected to.

In a front-page story at CNN.com last week, reporters Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz, and Eli Watkins alleged that Kislyak, who has been the ambassador to the United States since 2008, is “one of Russia’s top spies and spy-recruiters in Washington.” The reporters sourced the claim to anonymous “current and former senior US government officials.”

The claim and presentation of Kislyak was at odds with the view of those who knew him and worked with him. CTNI’s president Dimitri Simes discussed the need for a full investigation of Russian meddling as well as the problems with a leak campaign that is undermining diplomacy itself. But he strongly objected to the smears of any and all diplomatic engagement with the Russian ambassador.

“Is this an indication that the U.S. will not be capable of conducting any meaningful diplomacy?” he asked regarding the attacks on Kislyak. “Any attempt to have a meaningful conversation with nuances, if leaked to the press next morning and leaked in a very selective way, it’s very difficult to conduct meaningful diplomacy.” He warned that further demonization of Kislyak could have significant fallout for U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Tefft. Russia could decide to shut down the access Tefft has if the media and political opponents of Trump succeed in making diplomacy with the Russian ambassador impossible.

“The job of diplomats is to facilitate as many meetings as possible with a wide spectrum of the host country’s domestic political establishment on a wide range of issues,” wrote Nikolas Gvosdev, professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, in his essay “Damage Done: How Russia Hysteria Has Hurt U.S.-Russia Relations.” In fact, while the media frets about Trump officials talking to foreign officials, the bigger problem is not enough such meetings during the transition from the Obama presidency to the early days of the Trump presidency. Foreign ministers and bureaucrats in other countries have been complaining about not knowing who their new contacts are or will be, leading to confusion and delays in productive discussions.”

Michael Haltzel, a senior fellow at at the Center for Transatlantic Relations of Johns Hopkins’ School of Advanced International Studies and a former aide to Sen. Joe Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, harshly criticized Sessions for his handling of the question about contacts with Russia, but he agreed that attacks on Kislyak were unfortunate.

Wayne Merry, a veteran of the Foreign Service who was stationed in Moscow in 1993, said “ I have known Sergei Kislyak, I totally agree that what he has been exposed to is demonization. It’s total garbage. He’s a first-class professional. He’s being treated very shabbily.”

Even John Beyrle and the excitable Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassadors to Russia during Obama’s time in office, have warned that “America’s long-term interests are not served by attempting to suggest that contacts between American officials and Russian diplomats constitutes a treasonous or criminal act.”

I should mention that I also pushed back on the claim in a CNN appearance here. In any case, far from what the anonymous sources allegedly told CNN, Kislyak is widely regarded by those who have dealt with him as a top-notch diplomat who serves his country’s interests well. His post in Washington is expected to be his last, and his treatment in his remaining time here is considered an insult by both Americans and Russians. His rumored successor Anatoly Antonov will be “a force to be reckoned with,” as Matthew Rojansky, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute, has put it. Rojansky has also defended Kislyak in the media, and says he has “no indication” that Kislyak is a spy.

To What Effect?

Just as the treatment of Kislyak could result in the U.S. ambassador to Russia’s diminished standing and ability to accomplish his goals in Moscow, the general hysteria surrounding Russia might harm the United State’s serious foreign policy goals.

Syria/ISIS

While part of problem with the U.S.’ Syria policy during the previous administration was an inability to articulate U.S. interest in the region, there is some consensus about destroying ISIS and enabling refugees from the Syrian conflict to return home. Both the United States and Europe have an interest in the successful return of refugees. If the United States therefore wants a say in Syria, it will have to work with Russians to facilitate those objectives. Russia has a strong military presence, has brokered some management in the region, and has a willingness to work with partners. That means the country has to keep lines of communication and room for negotiation open. It also needs to clarify its position on Iran, since Russia views Iran as a key partner.

“If Russia and the U.S. can habituate themselves to cooperation in Syria, that can rebuild habits of cooperation that can spill over into other areas where you could see beneficial results occur,” said Gvosdev. But, he added, “that window is not going to stay open on this forever.” If the United States doesn’t make meaningful moves soon, there may not be many more opportunities before Russia, Turkey, and Iran move forward without the United States.

It’s worth noting that nobody considers Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be a Russian stooge, yet he is fully embracing dialogue and cooperation with Russians regarding regional disputes, a move that has shown beneficial to both countries.

Ukraine

Russian aggression in Ukraine has unsettled the region for several years, both in the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in the Donbass region. The United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia and Russians, but there is no resolution in sight. Russia is willing to keep fighting and has not buckled under the sanctions. Ukraine’s economy is suffering from lack of access to Russian markets. If the United States isn’t interested in brokering a peace, is it willing to arm Ukrainian forces and subsidize the country’s faltering economy? Is there an appetite on either the Left or Right for such intervention?

Not Going To War

The 1980s were fun, as Ruth Marcus noted above, but threat of nuclear annihilation was not so fun. Russia is not a superpower on par with the United States, but it is the only country that can take out the United States in short order. The United States needs to broker arms deals as well as encourage Russia not to get too cozy with China, forming alliances that could put U.S. interests at risk.

Economic Growth

Trade is one of the best ways to improve political relationships bilaterally. But not only is trade becoming quite difficult between Russia and the United States, on account of the sanctions, it was never a particularly deep relationship. Now there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding sanctions and how they will or won’t be enforced, a climate not conducive to business investment. Many people have argued that the “U.S. and Russia need to work on that to provide ballast and strengthen links in that relationship, creating incentives for a relationship that’s more of a practical relationship and less of a highly variable political relationship,” said Saunders, adding that the political climate is not very good for movement in that direction.

The bottom line is that the United States is embroiled in a hysterical reaction to Russian meddling in the Democratic Party that could spill over into far more serious consequences for the United States. Unless politicians and the media want the United States to have little to no leverage against ISIS or on behalf of Syrian refugees, want the United States to provide significant military and economic subsidies for Ukraine to fight Russia, are willing to risk war or proxy war with a nuclear power, and want to avoid peaceful means of improved relationships, they should think about whether pushing conspiracy theories for short-term domestic political gain is such a great idea.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/08/the-hysteria-over-russia-is-causing-serious-foreign-policy-problems/,2017-03-08
How The New York Times Enabled Ukraine's 'Bitter Harvest' In The 1930s,"Canadian filmmakers have just released a movie titled “Bitter Harvest” that recreates a tragic chapter in Ukrainian history. Ukraine suffered a devastating famine in the early 1930s that left millions of people dead. The movie portrays a story of two lovers struggling to survive during that dark period.

But this article is not a film review. Rather, it is a peek into how the American mainstream media covered these events some 85 years ago.

There is no consensus among historians as to the extent and causes of the famine. The estimates vary widely between 2.5 and 10 million people. In 2006, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law recognizing the famine as an intentional act of genocide by the Communist regime against the Ukrainian people. The current Russian government argues Communist Joseph Stalin’s disastrous economic policies caused the famine, but rejects the argument that it was a genocide specifically targeting ethnic Ukrainians.

Regardless of that dispute, the famine was definitely a tragedy of enormous proportions. Now, imagine that you live in the United States in the early 1930s and get your news from The New York Times (NYT). What do you know about this tragedy? The short answer is nothing.

The New York Times, Apologist for Communist Murder

The head of the NYT’s Moscow bureau at that time was Walter Duranty, an apologist for Bolshevism. American left-wing intellectuals enthusiastically greeted his dispatches from the Soviet Union. In 1931, Duranty was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles in the NYT that covered up Stalinism’s atrocities.

He vociferously denied the existence of the famine in Ukraine, claiming people were “hungry but not starving” and “there is no famine or actual starvation.” Some other Western journalists covering the USSR honestly reported on the famine. One of them was the Manchester Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Gareth Jones, but Duranty tried to discredit Jones’ reports, calling him a liar.

Other Western intellectuals denied the famine in Ukraine in the 1930s, including notably George Bernard Shaw. Some were duped—perhaps willingly—by their KGB handlers who showed them Potemkin’s villages. Duranty’s case had more sinister twists, because we know he was aware of the famine. According to his biography, titled “Stalin’s Apologist,” by Sally J. Taylor, Duranty admitted this when he visited the British embassy in Moscow in June 1932. An embassy official duly recorded his conversation with Duranty to that effect and dispatched his report to the British Foreign Office in London.

Money Hides a Lot of Other People’s Woes

We do not know what drove his desire to spread the fake news, but it may be related to his lifestyle in Russia. Taylor describes it as follows. He was a flamboyant lady’s man enjoying a life of luxury by both Russian and Western standards of that time. He had a researcher, a secretary, a chauffeur, a maid, and a cook.

A surreal aspect of Duranty’s life in Russia was his fondness for fine dining. Here is an excerpt from his description of meals available in a restaurant near his hotel: “caviar; … grilled salmon and roast partridge; … fine Russian cheese, hot-house grapes, old port and older cognac.” The NYT was willing to pay for all these amenities because Duranty managed to get exclusive interviews with Stalin. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement for all parties involved: Stalin received a good publicity in the West, the NYT published exclusive interviews with Stalin, which helped its circulation, while Duranty could lead his glamorous and lavish lifestyle.

It was mutually beneficial for all parties—that is, except for the millions of Ukrainian peasants.

The ending of this saga is rather cynical. In 2003, Ukrainian organizations petitioned the Pulitzer Board to posthumously revoke Duranty’s prize. After deliberation, the board extended its “sympathy to Ukrainians … who still mourn the suffering and deaths brought on by Josef Stalin,” but rejected the symbolic petition, claiming that it could not find “clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception.”

Duranty and his employer simply spread fake news while millions of people were dying. Their role was akin to that of a musical band that knows people in the next room are tortured and murdered, so they play loud music to drown out their screams, thus preventing outsiders from trying to help the victims.

Did The FBI Use Garbage Opposition Research To Spy On An American?,"The Washington Post used anonymous sources to report last week that the FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to spy on U.S. citizen Carter Page, an unpaid and informal adviser to the Donald Trump campaign, as part of an investigation into links between Russia and the Trump campaign. CNN used anonymous sources to report this week that the infamous “golden showers” dossier was used as part of the justification to win approval to monitor the Trump associate.

These latest leaks of classified information appear to be in response to Sen. Charles Grassley’s inquiry to FBI Director James Comey on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs. Grassley noted a February 28 Washington Post report, which used anonymous sources to report the FBI had made plans to pay dossier author Christopher Steele to continue investigating Trump before the election.

Paying an opposition researcher to investigate the Republican nominee for president in the run-up to the election “raises further questions about the FBI’s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration’s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends,” Grassley wrote.

Grassley demanded that the FBI turn over all records relating to the agreement, interviews of Steele, information on any government officials outside the FBI discussing the agreement with Steele, information on how the FBI obtained the dossier, any official reports that used Steele-collected information, any indication the FBI used the information before verifying it, and various other information, including:

9. Has the FBI relied on or otherwise referenced the memos or any information in the memos in seeking a FISA warrant, other search warrant, or any other judicial process? Did the FBI rely on or otherwise reference the memos in relation to any National Security Letters? If so, please include copies of all relevant applications and other documents.

These latest leaks answer that question. And the leaks about what intelligence agencies were doing during the presidential campaign begin to answer questions about whether the U.S. government has hard evidence that the Trump campaign had foreknowledge of Russian meddling and coordinated with Russians about that meddling, or whether there was rampant abuse of power in stripping an innocent U.S. citizen of his right not to be surveilled by his own government.

Much of the media response has remained incurious about the latter question and inclined toward the former claim. “We just got a huge sign that the US intelligence community believes the Trump dossier is legitimate,” wrote one reporter in response to the latest leaks, citing a former CIA general counsel as saying unconfirmed information about a potential target would not be included in the application for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance.

Leaks Contradict Recent Intelligence Agency Claims

But if information about Page from the dossier was confirmed by the FBI before seeking the surveillance, it contradicts what former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said publicly and on the record when its existence came to light in January: “The [Intelligence Community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions.”

Confirmation of the dossier’s allegations against Page would also contradict Clapper’s repeated claims that “we had no evidence of such collusion” between Trump and Russia. In an interview on “Meet the Press,” Chuck Todd asked him if the intelligence agencies’ report on Russia had gotten “to the bottom of this,” and Clapper responded, “It did — well, it got to the bottom of the evidence to the extent of the evidence we had at the time,” Clapper said. While Clapper has a history of not telling the truth, even under oath, he’d have little incentive to downplay evidence of Russia colluding with the Trump campaign.

Former acting CIA director and Hillary Clinton campaign surrogate Michael Morrell said, “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire, at all. … There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.” He went on to note that Steele used intermediaries to gather information from Russian sources, and that he paid people for information.

“Then I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you’re paying somebody, particularly former [Russian Federal Security Service] officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they’re going to call you up and say, ‘Hey, let’s have another meeting, I have more information for you,’ because they want to get paid some more,” Morrell said.

The Dossier’s Many Problems

Was the dossier used to secure a warrant against an American citizen in an opposing party’s campaign for president? Here are just a few problems with the dossier’s veracity and reliability.

Basic facts are in error.

As Owen Matthews wrote in January, “[T]here are several places where the author seems weirdly ignorant of basic facts about Russia. He or she refers to Alpha Bank rather than Alfa, and seems to be under the impression that the suburb of Barvikha on the tony Rublevskoe highway is a closed government compound, instead of just an expensive vacation home area favored by the new rich. The author also misspells the name of Trump associate and Azeri real estate mogul Aras Agalarov, and reports his association with Trump as news in August 2016—when Agalarov publicly organized Trump’s visit to the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 and arranged a meeting with top Russian businessmen for Trump afterward, both of which were widely reported at the time.”

Claims that are verifiably wrong.

Much of the report was vague or unverifiable. One of the few claims that could be easily checked turned out to be extremely wrong. Steele claimed that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met with Duma foreign affairs head Konstantin Kosachev in Prague “to clean up the mess left behind by western media revelations of…[former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort’s corrupt relationship with the former pro-Russian Yanukovych regime in Ukraine and Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page’s secret meetings in Moscow with senior regime figures in July 2016.” The only problem was that Cohen had never been to Prague and Kosachev said he hadn’t been there in five years.

Financially outlandish claims.

The dossier claimed Igor Sechen, who runs the Russian oil giant Rosneft and is a friend of Vladimir Putin, had a secret meeting with Page in which he offered Page a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in return for Trump lifting sanctions. That works out to $11 billion or so. The idea that Sechen would make this opening bid to an unpaid, informal advisor to a candidate observers thought was going to lose bigly, is ludicrous. For what it’s worth, Page has denied ever meeting Sechen, last year or any previous year. Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund and consulting firm specializing in the Russian and Central Asian oil and gas business.

Sexually outlandish claims.

The most exciting claim in the dossier was that Trump had paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed used by President and Mrs. Obama in a Moscow hotel. The dossier alleged various other perversions that had been explicitly enabled by Russian officials, adding that a former top-level Russian intelligence officer “asserted that Trump’s unorthodox behavior in Russia over the years had provided the authorities there with enough embarrassing material on the now Republican presidential candidate to be able to blackmail him if they so wished.”

It’s not even that these reports were unverifiable, it’s that they show no understanding of Trump’s public image as a sexual pervert. In what way would learning about his infidelities or indiscretions be a blackmailing situation? Particularly since the coordination with Russian officials would mean Trump was aware of the supposedly compromising information.

Claiming Russians had been cultivating, supporting, and assisting Trump for more than five years.

At the time the dossier claims Russians began cultivating him, Trump was a reality TV star who was just coming out of bankruptcy. Another part of the report claimed that the Kremlin had been feeding Trump information on Clinton and other opponents for “several years,” a bizarre thing for the Kremlin to do with someone who only announced his candidacy in June 2015.

Contradictory information on business deals.

The dossier claimed Trump was working hard to meet with Russian business leaders but that “so far Trump has declined serious sweetheart real estate business deals offered him in Russia.”

Questionable claims of collusion.

The report claimed that Trump and his team accepted a regular flow of intelligence on Democratic and other political rivals. Sure, but then why did they never use any of it?

Claiming a communications official controlled a dossier of compromising information on Clinton

As Matthews notes, “Why would such a dossier be controlled by [Dmitry] Peskov, whose job is to talk to the press, when it must have originated with the FSB and/or FAPSI, the federal electronic surveillance service? Peskov is a Kremlin courtier, the charming public face of the regime, not a spy.”

Claiming Manafort and Page’s views were bought.

The dossier claimed that Page and Manafort agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine and raise NATO defense commitments in exchange for the WikiLeaks operation. But Page and Manafort have publicly expressed these foreign policy views going back years. Page lived and worked in Russia for years, and is a vocal critic of anti-Russian foreign policy. Manafort worked in the Ukraine for Russian-allied political groups.

Using a document riddled with so many errors and logical flaws to justify state surveillance on a U.S. citizen is not a great look for intelligence agencies. To be sure, opposition research is always like this. Any political journalist can tell you stories about outlandish claims that they are pitched, only to find out the claims are made up in whole or part. But the idea that intelligence agencies were using such opposition research, paid for by opponents of Trump’s campaign, and considering paying the person who claimed to collect it, is something that should at least set off journalistic alarms about political use of intelligence agencies.

Media Must Ask What Justified the Warrant

The New York Times also used anonymous sources to report on the U.S. government’s surveillance of Page. The article claims “when [Page] became a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign last year and gave a Russia-friendly speech at a prestigious Moscow institute, it soon caught the bureau’s attention. That trip last July was a catalyst for the F.B.I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump’s campaign, according to current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials.”

If this is true that this was the catalyst, it is concerning. The Times article explains at great length how little a role Page had in the campaign and how far from central he was, to put it mildly. It notes that he worked in Russia and was critical of U.S. foreign policy toward Russia. At no point is anything illegal alleged. To be clear, since many in the media are not clear on this point, it is still legal in this country to be critical of U.S. foreign policy toward another country.

According to The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, federal agents need to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the “target of the surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.” Carter Page is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, businessman, and academic who will tell anyone who will listen his views that NATO enlargement was a mistaken foreign policy, and that hostility to Russia is a bad strategy for the United States.

These things are not illegal or evidence of being an agent of the Russians. In fact, going to Moscow after being named in major media as a foreign policy advisor to the president to loudly proclaim a pro-Russian line critical of existing policy at a prominent university is not exactly top spycraft. Yes, it could be double-super-secret-spycraft, and perhaps the U.S. government, which has now been revealed to have spied on a U.S. citizen, has evidence to support such surveillance. Did the FBI go to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) after corroborating the claims of the dossier? Or did the agency go to the court and characterize the information as credible based on the fact its paid opposition researcher had been an MI6 spy?

Defenders of the FBI say that the FISC judge wouldn’t have issued warrant without strong corroborating evidence and that the courts reviewing applications are very strict. However, securing warrants from a judge does not appear to be as difficult as some claim. Some 38,365 applications for FISA surveillance were made through 2015. Courts denied only 12 requests since 1979. That’s a rejection rate of .03 percent.

Until evidence is provided, journalists who care about privacy and abuse of power should be asking tough questions of everyone involved. Despite a nearly year-long campaign of leaks and innuendo to tie Trump to Russia, nothing has been provided to support the claim of collusion. Until and unless any of the people making such claims produce actual evidence of Trump associates having knowledge of Russian actions beforehand, and coordinating the placement and timing of leaks for political effect, the proper focus of journalists should be on the rampant abuse of power in a political opponent being surveilled by his own government.

Reporters like to present themselves as advocates of civil liberties. Journalism awards were thrown around for work done exposing government surveillance of U.S. citizens leading up to the Church Committee report. Democracy dies in darkness, we’re told, but who is championing the right of individuals against the overweening central power of the surveillance state?

Again, maybe the U.S. government has every reason to be spying on Carter Page. But if he was spied on for having political views or associates at odds with the Obama administration, that’s a problem. Like-minded people favoring a change in U.S. foreign policy should not be illegal. That’s politics, and precisely why elections are held in a free country. Government resources, law enforcement, and surveillance powers simply shouldn’t be put to partisan use. If nothing comes of this nearly year-long investigation into a political campaign, accountability must be demanded.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/04/20/did-the-fbi-use-garbage-opposition-research-to-spy-on-an-american/,2017-04-20
Center For National Interest Director On History Of Russia Hysteria,"Ben Domenech: We’re coming to you from Hillsdale College Kirby’s Center in Washington, DC where my guest for the hour today is Paul Saunders, who’s the Executive Director of The Center for the National Interest. You can follow him on Twitter @1796farewell which is an interesting choice for your handle, Paul. Tell us a little bit about why that is.

Paul Saunders: Well, I’m a great fan of George Washington’s farewell address and actually, Washington generally. We could do well to pay a little bit more attention to him than we do.

Ben Domenech: We should think about him more especially when it comes to the realm of foreign policy, shouldn’t we?

Paul Saunders: Well, that’s a good place to start. He has a number of useful admonitions there, some relating to having excessive sympathy for other countries, others, actually, are related to having too much antipathy for other countries which he viewed as equally dangerous.

Ben Domenech: You are, of course, a foreign policy expert and I want to talk to you about that. We spend a lot of our time on this show looking at various aspects of policy more than politics. I think that we do need to have a discussion about the politics of the Russia investigation that has been playing out in the mainstream media in the past several months. I am used to, now, seeing at 5:00 or 6:00 every evening some new report from The New York Times, The Washington Post or CNN that describes in very breathless terms something that, oftentimes, has already been reported or reported in some other fashion typically involving anonymous sources. What is your attitude toward this overall Russia investigation of the president and particularly to the naming of Former Director Mueller to head up a special counsel investigation into it?

Paul Saunders: Sure. Well, I’d say several things about that. First of all, from a political perspective, at this point, it’s probably unavoidable to have a special counsel just to maintain public confidence in the process. That said, I don’t really view it as necessary for many perspective, other than a political perspective and I’m not sure that it’s that desirable because I think our past experience with special counsels has been … They start looking for certain things that may not pan out, then they start looking at a number of other things. Once you’ve got a bunch of government lawyers with an almost unlimited budget looking for somebody who filled out a form incorrectly or something like that, it’s virtually certain that they’ll find something.

Ben Domenech: You, obviously, are someone who’s spent a lot of time looking at issues related to Russia and paying attention to them. What is your perspective on what they think of the way that this investigation is played out? We’ve seen them effectively, on a number of different instances, act as if they’re basically trolling the press or something along those lines. Do you think that their attitude towards it is this is all just a big joke? What is their assumption about it?

Paul Saunders: Well, certainly they’re denying having interfered in the election which most people don’t find especially credible at this point although obviously, there’s a manner of degree and there are a variety of other questions. Intent is another question that has yet to be established. I think their basic attitude is that this is an example of the American media and political system going just totally out of control. They have, from their point of view, seen an anti-Russia hysteria in the United States for many years now and from their point of view, this process is the culmination, really, of that.

Ben Domenech: It seems to me that we’re very early in appreciating what this administration is going to look like. One of the things that has already become evident is that the president has a tendency to just fire from the hip when it comes to a lot of the ways that he shares information. We had this conversation that took place within the White House with Russian representatives that was very quickly, in the press, depicted as being him sharing information that wasn’t appropriate. Obviously, General McMaster pushed back against that. What do you think needs to change about the way that the president approaches these types of conversations if anything?

Paul Saunders: Well, I think that it would be helpful for the president to develop a relationship of trust with some of his advisors or alternatively, to bring in some advisors with whom he already has established relationships of trust so that he is in a position to turn to others for advice and guidance and is comfortable hearing it. That’s a good departure point.

That being said, the specific circumstances of the conversation with the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador, I’m not sure that I really have a problem with that. It’s certainly within the president’s authority to decide to share information like that.

If you look back historically when President Nixon and Henry Kissinger went to China, Nixon had Kissinger give the Chinese a pretty detailed and quite classified briefing on Soviet military deployments which could not have been done in a way that didn’t reveal American capabilities to the Chinese who were, in theory, a potential adversary.

Nixon and Kissinger calculated that it was worth sharing that information partly to try to develop a relationship of trust and a common strategic understanding with the Chinese. Actually, partly to reveal to the Chinese what our capabilities were which could also be a deterrent to the Chinese.

Ben Domenech: “Here, look at this stick.”

Paul Saunders: Right. It’s appropriates for presidents to share information like that if it’s a part of, what I would call, a strategic decision-making process.

Ben Domenech: I feel like one of the things that we have trouble detecting, if we are not fully versed in this type of conversation and this level of discussion between foreign figures, is we see a lot of things that are fairly normal in the Trump era being depicted as huge breaks with normalcy as being, “Oh, this is unprecedented. I can’t believe they would do X, I can’t believe they would do Y.”

This can even take place at a very benign level. We saw the depictions on the internet of all sorts of things that are perfectly normal for a president to do as being unprecedented and as something that should rile people up in various ways.

Whether it’d came to dismissals of certain government officials or something as small as the fact that President Trump put his books on the same bookshelf that President Obama had previously been displaying his books. That type of thing seems to be true of this Russia conversation as well. I’d like to know from your perspective, what actually strikes you as being unprecedented or odd about what the Russians that’s related to our election and what is something that has happened more typically?

Paul Saunders: Well, let me maybe approach that from a slightly different way. I was listening yesterday to the Former CIA Director Mr. Brennan and his testimony. One of the things that I found interesting in his testimony was his statement that he was in touch with the head of one of Russia’s intelligence services to warn that individual that it was a mistake for Russia to interfere in the American political process and it could cause backlash in the United States and prevent any kind of favorable change in the US-Russia relationship.

What I found interesting about that is it made me think to myself so did Director Brennan warned President Obama or Secretary Clinton, then Secretary Clinton, at any point that American efforts to influence Russia’s internal politics might provoke a backlash in Russia? That that might have consequences in the US-Russia relationship and for Russian perspectives on the US-Russia relationship. It’s quite clear from the testimony of others that they felt that Putin was reacting in no small part to that very perception that the United States had been too deeply engaged in Russian politics.

The first thing that I think about in this whole situation is the context and the context is not a context of one day out of the blue, the Russian government decided to intervene in the American political process. The context is, instead, that we have a relationship of rivalry and mistrust in which the United States, well, really since the end of the Cold War, has been trying in various different ways to promote political outcomes in Russia that we want and the current Russian government doesn’t appreciate that.

Now, you asked, of course, a different question, what’s new and different or what isn’t new and different? Yeah, there are a lot of things that we still don’t know and the answers that come out during these investigations will give us more of a sense but things like Moscow-controlled media running a story that’s favorable to one or not to another. That’s very common in the Cold War era. Certainly, having operatives trying to collect and disseminate information that’s going to help somebody or hurt somebody else not really outside the historical parameters for that relationship either.

Ben Domenech: Is it outside historical parameters to have people in the media or in public eye go as crazy about this as individuals have since the election? That’s something that I’m not used to seeing play out in real time thanks to the tools of social media.

Paul Saunders: No, there actually was a time in American history when something similar did happen in the 1950s, Senator Joe McCarthy who played a central role in that. Our political process has gone completely out of control and we were talking at the beginning about George Washington and his farewell address, another important element of it, of course, was Washington’s warning about the spirit of party.

I’ll condense a little bit one of the quotes but he said the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge is its own frightful despotism. That’s what we’re living through right now and I wouldn’t hold either party blameless in that.

I don’t think it’s appropriate to but certainly, at the current time, the Democrats who are animated, clearly although a small part, by this eagerness for revenge and it has unleashed a torrent of really unprecedented invective directed at a sitting president. Plus standards of evidence and standards of logic that are far looser than I remember or really seen for quite some time.

Ben Domenech: Is this a situation you feel like there’s going to be any break to this acceleration? We’ve seen people, people who formerly held significant positions in media or in academia, make outrageous claims about various things including, of course, that Donald Trump would never actually be sworn into office, that he would be removed by now, that there is compromising material and all these different individuals and that type of thing. None of it actually coming to a conclusion, is there going to be anything that stops that or do you think it’s just going to keep going for four years?

Paul Saunders: Well, I think it’s going to go for a long time. Certainly, I hope that the various investigations will proceed expeditiously, that they’ll uncover anything that should be uncovered and that that will help us to move on as a country. My instinct, unfortunately, is that even the conclusion of these many investigations in a manner that doesn’t implicate the president in any wrong doing won’t really be enough to put an end to it. I fully expect that the 2018 mid-term election is going to be driven by this and that that’s going to create it’s own climate. I assume that’s going to start, actually, fairly soon. It’s probably sooner than anyone would wish. Unfortunately, we’re going to see this poisonous atmosphere for a long time to come.

Ben Domenech: Tell us a little bit about your background and how you ended up at the center. Tell us a little bit about what you’ve been doing as it relates to foreign policy over the years.

Paul Saunders: Well, I’ve been at The Center for the National Interest, actually, for much of the last 20 years. We changed our name during that period. It’s an organization, actually, that was founded by Former President Richard Nixon. It used to be known as The Nixon Center. We changed our name five or six years ago. I took a break in the middle of that period to work in the George W. Bush administration, I was a Senior Adviser at The Department of State and worked in the part of the State Department that deals with transnational issues. The department has been reorganized since then, actually, so that office doesn’t exist in quite the same form. It was an office that dealt with issues like human rights, refugees, international narcotics, drug trafficking, climate change, a lot of the cross border challenges is global issues that the department called them at that time.

Ben Domenech: You talked about spending that much time at the center, did you have the opportunity interact with Former President Nixon at all during those times?

Paul Saunders: I met him once late in his life which was a terrific experience. Henry Kissinger is the Honorary Chairman of our Board, still to this day, and it’s been really terrific to have a chance to meet him and to interact with him over the years.

Ben Domenech: When you think about the role that President Nixon had and his team, one of the things that, it seems to me, is that he was the last true strategist that we had in the office of the presidency. The people who have been there since have often been reactive as opposed to having a strategic agenda that is thought through from the perspective of the office. Do you think that we would be better off having people who arrived to the presidency with more of the mindset that Richard Nixon or do you think that this is a situation where now, given the challenges that we face, it’s more difficult to have someone who think in those long-term goals?

Paul Saunders: I think it’s always difficult to think long-term for anyone in an office like that because you’re constantly besieged with day-to-day challenges. Certainly, the 24-hour news cycle of today is something that Nixon and Kissinger and others in the past that they didn’t have to contend with. At the same time, that kind of strategic approach is essential. Look, the United States is certainly the dominant global power but we don’t have unlimited power, we don’t have unlimited money, we don’t have a military with unlimited capabilities. We have to establish strategic priorities and establishing strategic priorities also means establishing that some things aren’t priorities. That those other issues need to be subordinated to our priorities so that we can achieve the things that we need to achieve as a nation.

Ben Domenech: What’s been wrong with America’s dominant foreign policy establishment, for lack of a better term, in this past season of life? It seems that they often gone off in directions that are very much at odds with what Americans would prefer the foreign policy of the government be. There’s all sorts of polls and data to look at when it comes to that. Why is the foreign policy’s overall order is at such a distance from the way that Americans would prefer the country run?

Paul Saunders: Well, I see two factors. I’m sure there are many but there are two that jump out for me. One is that for many in our elites, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the American success in outlasting the USSR really seemed to leave no challenger for the United States and at the same time, to validate our approach. The consequence of that was to give many in our elites a sense that there were really unlimited possibilities for the United States, a sense of lack of constraints. At the same time, the collapse of the Soviet Union also had another consequence for our elites and how they thought about US foreign policy.

That was really the loss of intellectual discipline if I can put it that way. During the Cold War when the United States made important foreign policy decisions, our leaders always had to ask themselves, “Okay, so we have these three options. How are the Soviets going to react if we do this? How will they react if we do that? How will they react if we take this other approach?”

It required us to think not just about what we wanted and what we were to do but how others would respond to our actions and would we be better off or worse off after others responded. People in the US Military would say the enemy gets a vote and as a decision-making system and a political system, we’ve lost this ability to think about how others ar going to react when we make decisions. It leads to a situation in which people advocate particular policies assuming that if the United States does X, then we will impose our solution, everyone else will go along with that, the issue will be resolved and then we can move on to something else. It’s obviously wrong.

Ben Domenech: I feel like one of the things that we see happening around the world today is just an assertion that America needs to be much more involved in every other aspect of what’s happening, that our presence would solve the various problems and challenges that are affecting people negatively around the world. That hasn’t been something that we’ve been doing all that well recently, has it? It’s not something that we have a lot of provable situations perhaps other than disaster relief where our involvement has been a huge success, let’s put it that way. That’s something that I wonder why doesn’t make them pause, doesn’t make them reconsider their approach if their answer is always American involvement to a significant degree and that’s an unknown cost and for an unknown length of time.

Paul Saunders: Look, I certainly agree. I’m certainly surprised that it doesn’t give people pause. I would say on one level, look, we’re an exceptional country, there are a lot of amazing things about the United States. I think if we’re honest with ourselves, we also have to recognize that we have a number of challenges as a country that we have not been able, ourselves, successfully to address. In some cases, over a long periods of time. Knowing that about ourselves, the idea that we can go elsewhere and that we are uniquely suited to solve others’ problems strikes me as very, very ambitious. It’s particularly striking to me, actually, when people on the right take this view because you have individuals who, within the context of their own society, would be resolutely opposed to the idea of government as a social engineer, if I can put it that way, who very readily adopt that role for the United States government elsewhere.

Ben Domenech: It’s very odd in the sense that there’s just an assumption that we would be able to get these various things right if we were simply involved to a greater degree but that’s been what people have been pushing for. The media as it relates to a lot of different conflicts but none, it seems more so, than Syria. Do you think that American involvement to a greater degree in Syria could have any hope of having a mitigating effect on that conflict or is this a situation where what would be required of us in order to achieve that goal would be such a burden that the American people would just be unwilling to bear it there?

Paul Saunders: I think one of the important realities of, certainly, international affairs and also of our own politics is that something that might be possible at one point in time is not possible at another point in time. There may have been a point in time when a relatively modest expenditure of US resources or a modest effort could have made a difference. I think, at this point, that time has long passed.

Ben Domenech: Yeah. Well, it also just seems to me though that that hasn’t, despite that time being passed, it hasn’t necessarily been something that has changed the use of the media’s megaphone and other actors basically saying something must be done, something must be done. Sometimes, again given to your point the different context of these questions, sometimes there’s nothing that can be done in these situations, is there?

Paul Saunders: Well, look, it’s a tragic situation. In this particular case, I certainly would support diplomatic efforts to try to find some kind of a political settlement in Syria. I certainly would support efforts to try to create the largest practical coalition to fight against ISIS. Those two things make sense and wouldn’t necessarily cost the United States too much. At the same time, clearly there are limits. If we look at Iraq, if we look at Libya, if we look at Afghanistan, particularly at Afghanistan I have to say, there’s very little evidence that sustained, large scale, American troop presence and massive investment of taxpayer resources can really create sustainable situations. In Afghanistan, it’s an open question of how long that government would last absent American support, after how long?

Ben Domenech: It also seems to me that the American people have grown, I don’t want to say war weary, but weary of conflicts where they have no clear outcome, no clear, “This is what victory looks like. This is how we’re going to achieve it,” approach. Why is that? Because it seems to me that in the past that that was, at least, something that’s definitionally a part of most of the cases that we had for being involved in various conflicts, “This is the thing we want to achieve.” Now, it seems like we are signing up for permanent stability missions basically where in the absence of a massive American military presence and putting the lives of American sons and daughters at risk all the time is something that’s just expected as being part of any conflict. Why did that change?

Paul Saunders: Well, there are a couple of elements to that. One is this idea that we can’t really leave until every single problem has been fixed. We’ve got to create a stable, Jeffersonian democracy wherever we go to war. Another element of it is that there are people who have been advocating in favor of intervention for a long period of time and they keep saying, every time, over and over again, “If we don’t use force, then we’re not showing leadership.” Americans want to be leaders, they want our country to have that kind of a role so that argument worked for a certain period of time. Then, it stopped working and Americans decided, “If that’s what leadership means, then we don’t really want leadership.” During the end of the Bush administration, early in the Obama administration, you saw many Americans pulling back. There was also rejection of Obama’s particular approach to that political problem and there were many people who felt that he wasn’t doing enough which is a separate issue. These two dynamics have been at play.

Ben Domenech: You have a couple of pieces up at the National Interest site, Nationalinterest.org. If we can look at a couple of different figures who I’d like to talk to you about now. You have one up from about a week ago in which you contrasted the way the two Former Intelligence Chiefs look at Russia and look at the issues associated with it. You were looking at what Bob Gates had to say about it and what James Clapper had to say about it. Talk to me about the differences between these men and their style when it comes to Russia.

Paul Saunders: Well, I thought what was most important about Bob Gates who, certainly, has no particular sympathy for Moscow let me put it that way. What’s important about Bob Gates is that he places Russian conduct into historical context and into the context of the US-Russia relationship and he tries to think about Russian perspective and Russian motives. That doesn’t mean excusing Russian conduct, what it means is trying to understand Russian conduct so that we can deal with it. General Clapper has taken a much more simplistic approach and doesn’t really try to make that intellectual effort. Frankly, he looks much more like a politician in some respects than an intelligence official.

Ben Domenech: It seems to me that one of the things that you see from Clapper quite a lot is that he will say something and then he’ll try to distance himself from it after the fact. That he’ll get over his skis on something, a particular thing and then basically, have to do work afterwards to repair it. You certainly saw that during his tenure and the various testimonies that he offered to Congress which I still think could be particularly actionable in a number of different ways. Let’s just stick to that right now, do you think that he’s just being irresponsible when he makes the kind of assertions that he’s made recently? The assertions that sound more like the kind of things that would be coming out of the mouth of a senator, as a politician as you say, as opposed to someone who held the position that he did?

Paul Saunders: Well, look, I certainly don’t have any special insight into General Clapper for that matter and to Former Director Brennan, Former CIA Director Brennan. Brennan, he was on Obama’s White House staff before he went to the CIA. We need to remember that. In Clapper’s case, certainly we know that he was at the center of the Obama administration’s difficult parting from General Flynn. There is a legacy here. If you listen to Brennan’s recent testimony, a real hostility, really a clear, personal hostility to the president. Look, people are entitled to have their perspectives on the president but Americans are also entitled to have senior officials in key security agencies who are objective and who serve the national interest.

Ben Domenech: What do you think of General Flynn? Do you think that he is someone who is unstable? Is he someone who was never cut out for this kind of work to begin with? What is it that’s happened to him in his career?

Paul Saunders: Well, I’ve never met General Flynn. All I really know about him I know from the press which is not necessarily the most reliable source these days. What I would say is that he certainly seems to have exercised bad judgment at a number of important points. Now, bad judgment is different from doing something illegal. I would say conversely, the idea that someone could blackmail General Flynn because he left out some information in talking to the Vice-President about his conversations with the Russian ambassador is preposterous.

Ben Domenech: One of the things that we’ve seen, unfortunately, in a lot of the reports about this is a lack of skepticism when it comes to the reporting that we read. One of the things that I’m sure you’re familiar with as being a long tenured person in Washington is just that whenever you’re reading a story, you should be sure to put the hat on and look at who benefits from this being reported, why is this being reported in a particular way, why is this source not on the record, et cetera.

I feel like one of the things that we’ve seen around this Russian investigation and all the questions related to General Flynn and elsewhere is just an overheated nature of reporting that, basically, attempts to make everything sound important, puts very little context around the actual discussion of what’s going on in the country and presents the viewer or listener with information that is often incomplete or is more designed to benefit the political leanings of the source as opposed to reveal something that we should actually be concerned about. In your own discussions, because I’m sure you’ve had them with friends or colleagues about this sort of thing, what do you do to try to stamp down a little bit and say, “Calm down, this is not as crazy a thing as you’re saying.”?

Paul Saunders: Well, since I follow Russia professionally and often read the Russian media, I’m used to reading the media with a skeptical eye. I wish I didn’t have to apply some of the same analytical processes that I apply in reading the Russian media now to the American media. That’s the reality that we’re living in and certainly whenever you read the Russian media, you’re often focused actually less on what’s being reported and more on who might be behind this story and why and what are they trying to accomplish. Another element on this whole situation which really sticks in my mind goes back to the period of the campaign. One of The New York Times editors, I think his name is Jim Rutenberg, wrote an entire column about how normal standards of journalism should not apply in covering Donald Trump because he represented, from Rutenberg’s perspective, such an unprecedented threat to American democracy. There are a number of people in the mainstream liberal media who feel that way, who actually don’t believe that they’re obliged to uphold their professional standards because they believed that this is a unique situation. It’s quite remarkable. Going back though to the issue about the analytical process that you have to go through, there was a recent story in The Washington Post about this flap surrounding Congressman Kevin McCarthy’s comments about the president and one of this colleagues in the House. The most remarkable thing to me about that story was the dateline which was Kiev, Ukraine. There’s a story about this recording, of this conversation which supposedly took place when our members of Congress were meeting with officials from Ukraine. This recording leaks, the person who’s writing about it is writing about it from Ukraine but there’s no discussion in the article of what’s the source of this recording, how did The Washington Post get it? That’s unusual.

Ben Domenech: Yeah, that seems highly unusual. It is something that we’re having to get used to in depicting the coverage of this administration. You describe yourself on your Twitter handle as being a foreign policy realist, you had a piece recently about Rex Tillerson’s address to the State Department and his advocacy, his articulation of the foreign policy views of this administration. Are the realists in charge now after being away from it for awhile or is this a situation where you’ve got a lot of different people with a lot of different views trying to figure out what the president wants and what they can do to achieve it?

Paul Saunders: More the latter than the former at this point. Certainly, the president and some of his advisors seemed to have some instincts that are in line with a realist’s perspective on US foreign policy. They also have some other instincts and there are a variety of different people advising the president and increasingly spreading out through the US government. I expect that in this administration like in any other administration, there will be a variety of competing perspectives which is a good thing.

Ben Domenech: Yes. How did you view Tillerson’s address and what did you take away from it as a vision of what he is going to try to achieve as Secretary of State and what the president’s going to try to achieve?

Paul Saunders: Well, I certainly viewed it as a very important address because I saw it as the first occasion on which someone other than the president had really outlined, in a thoughtful and comprehensive way, what this America First approach means. I saw a lot there that I like. I thought it was a very sensible and practical and pragmatic approach to US foreign policy and I think if it succeeds, it’ll do a lot of good for the country.

Ben Domenech: It’s one of these things that I think is going to be a real test though because we’ve seen a Republican administration that was, for a significant part of its tenure, led by a lot of neoconservative figures. We’ve seen the consequences to their fortunes of basically having a couple of failures on their hand for, at least, let’s say the more utopian vision that they had among them of spreading democracy in the Middle East. Do you think that if President Trump’s tenure is viewed as being one that faces significant challenge or problems and when it comes to the arena of foreign policy, that this will end up discrediting the people who have advocated for maybe a more restrained or realistic approach to foreign policy?

Paul Saunders: Well, that’s certainly a danger. Beyond that, I would say that many of the people who want a more interventionist foreign policy are going to be looking for every possible opportunity to try to attack the president and the administration on precisely that access. It certainly does argue in favor of the president and his advisors taking a very thoughtful and deliberate approach in making foreign policy and making sure when they do things, that they succeed.

Ben Domenech: One of the things that we’re going to see tested, particularly as we saw in the early goings related to Syria, was whether the president is going to be someone who takes very quick action in response to things. He seems, in many ways, to be the opposite of President Obama in that respect. Given that, what do you think, internally, people who work for him need to guard against as maybe a rash decision or something that could potentially have a bigger negative effect than just throwing some Tomahawks at Syria?

Paul Saunders: Sure. Well, in any foreign policy decision-making process, you always want to pause and to think about unintended consequences of your decisions. That’s always something to take seriously and the Tomahawk strike was basically constructive. I don’t have a particular problem with that but at the same time, looking at it from the perspective of unintended consequences, one of the things that we saw fairly quickly after that was the Syrians moving many of their aircraft to new locations that were much closer to the air base that the Russians are using which will make it much harder to do anything like that again in the future.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/26/director-of-center-for-national-interest-gives-historical-context-for-russia-hysteria/,2017-05-26
Can We Escape A Second Cold War With Russia?,"Recently, I brought Peter Conradi’s “Who Lost Russia? How the World Entered a New Cold War” to a dialogue between American, European, and Russian experts convened at the Kozmetsky Center at St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas.

This book could have served as the script of our conversations—the bill of particulars from Russian participants on all the alleged and actual Western slights, mistakes, and betrayals; Western concerns over troubling Russian domestic and international behavior; the different assessments of what “partnership” should look like; whether Russia should take its place within the structures of the Euro-Atlantic world (and what leadership role it ought to play) or needs to strike out on its own as an independent pole of power in the international system; whether Russia even qualifies as a great power and global player or needs to accept a diminished role in world events; the re-litigation of the reunification of Germany, the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Ukraine.

For readers and interested parties who cannot attend such conclaves of specialists, Who Lost Russia? is a concise, accessible, and focused narrative of the tangled, complicated, and ultimately unfulfilled relationship between Russia and the West over the past 25 years. Conradi makes sure to present a wide array of Russian, European, and American voices—policymakers and politicians, statesmen, experts and analysts—and lets them speak. The foreign editor of the Sunday Times, Conradi is less interested in dazzling the reader with his own expertise and opinions (although he is not a passive relater of the events he chronicles), and instead crafted a book resting on the principle of he reports, and you, the reader, adjudicate.

In chronicling the events of the past three decades, Conradi does not break new ground with breathtaking revelations from hitherto secret archives, but what makes his work all the more important—and why his narrative needs to be read—is that he has no legacy to defend, no need to use his prose to insist on the rightness of his analysis or the policy choices made by his preferred politicians. Because he carries no water for any particular administration or country, he is not shy in calling out mistakes and missteps but also does not rush to assume the worst (or best) possible interpretation of a leader’s motives or intentions.

Contradictory Imperatives

As a veteran reporter and observer, he concentrates on providing the facts of the matter and how everyone around the table understood and perceived those facts. In his treatment of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to include new members from the former Soviet bloc—perhaps one of the most contentious issues in the post-Cold War relationship between Russia and the United States—Conradi deftly sets forward the objections of Russia, the concerns of the new member states (including the reasons impelling them to seek refuge in the alliance) and U.S. efforts at legerdemain.

This last part involved American leadership juggling the contradictory imperatives of reassuring Russia that the alliance posed no threat to Moscow, while conveying to the new members that their security would not be neglected, and that Russia could be given a substantive role in Western security matters without somehow involving an actual veto over decisions. Conradi allows those voices who supported expansion and those that did not to appear and debate on his pages. A fair and balanced treatment of other critical issues likewise characterizes his prose.

But Conradi does not simply passively chronicle events. He is critical across the board, particularly how political elites clung to their illusions and looked for ways to avoid making hard choices or bearing serious costs. On the Russian side, Conradi is unsparing in depicting a Russian leadership, especially under Boris Yeltsin, who embraced a fantastically unrealistic belief that the West would preserve a post-Soviet Russia’s great power status during its period of weakness.

Another consistent theme is Moscow’s unwillingness to reconcile the image of the role it wanted to play in the world—still as a near-peer power to the United States, in some regards—with what Russia could actually mobilize in terms of economic and military power. Likewise, Vladimir Putin’s plans to make Russia great again may end up being unrealizable, while many of his actions over the last several years have proven counterproductive to his ultimate geopolitical aims—notably how the Putin threat has helped to rejuvenate the NATO alliance.

America’s Delusions

The U.S. policy community will be more than happy with Conradi’s accounting of Russia’s missteps in the relationship, but may be less likely to take the opportunity provided by this book to take a good hard look in the mirror. Conradi is unsparing in his assessment that the United States, under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, deluded itself into believing it could achieve grand geopolitical goals with a minimum of effort—essentially hoping they could build a Porsche for the price of a Ford Taurus. The United States was unprepared to underwrite the costs of a true post-Communist rehabilitation of Russia or invest in building up the capacities of the other post-Soviet states to contain a resurgent Russia. Often, in Conradi’s narratives, U.S. efforts seemed more focused on box-checking rather than on achieving sustainable results.

In particular, the United States was prepared to write checks that it fervently hoped would never be cashed, whether making what ultimately turned out to be empty pledges to Ukraine that Washington would safeguard its territorial integrity in return for giving up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union (the so-called Budapest Memorandum) or hoping that the conundrum of NATO expansion would somehow solve itself over time. There is a clear sense that U.S. policy tended to be reactive rather than proactive, aided by the fact that the Washington policy establishment could never firmly resolve the ongoing disputes between the Russia-engagers or the Russia-skeptics, between those who saw good relations with Moscow as the key versus those who prioritized expanding the Euro-Atlantic community into the former Soviet bloc.

The stalemate between what Conradi describes as the “Putin lovers” versus the “democracy lovers” in the George W. Bush administration meant that the United States did just enough to anger the Kremlin while failing to really change the geopolitical realities of the post-Soviet space. Thus, while the United States trained and equipped the Georgian armed forces and dangled eventual membership in NATO, little was done to prevent Russia from effectively crushing the Georgian military or dismembering the Georgian state once Moscow decided that its red lines in the Caucasus had been crossed.

Indeed, the conclusion that one reaches from Conradi’s narrative is of a U.S. policy establishment that found it hard to prioritize U.S. goals and was unprepared to say “no” when confronted with competing preferences. Therefore, the United States sought to square a number of unpleasant circles—trying to come up with a Russia-NATO relationship alongside admitting new members, for instance—and usually failing at making such contortions in policy work.

The alternative was to hope that others would get the United States out of the jam, so that the U.S.-Russia reset under the Obama administration could only take off once Viktor Yanukovych himself took Ukraine out of geopolitical contention by announcing in 2010 that Ukraine would not seek NATO membership, thus allowing the Obama team to claim that the United States had not rescinded its invitation, but that Ukraine itself had “voluntarily” stopped its NATO bid. But the Ukraine issue returned front and center in 2014 when a new government indicated that it wanted to restart the process of joining the alliance, and Russia chose to directly intervene on Ukrainian soil.

Two Unpleasant Realities Converge

It also becomes clear from Conradi’s narrative that the United States did not want to consider the possibility that two unpleasant realities might converge: one, that there would never be good relations between the United States and Russia, even a post-Soviet, post-Communist one; and that Russian weakness would prove to be temporary and a resurgent Moscow would become the dominant power in Eurasia. Instead, the early assumption was that, after the Cold War, Russia would no longer have any significant differences of opinion with Washington on any international issue—and if it did, it would not matter, because Russia had ceased to be a great power in any meaningful sense.

By not taking into account these possibilities in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States failed to either create an accommodation with Russia when they would have more amenable to certain compromises that are now off the table, or to push harder to secure the destinies of the post-Soviet region by creating incontestable facts on the ground. Today, of course, much of that room to manuever is now gone, and the United States must now consider how it plans to adhere to the commitments it made, such as Article 5 defense guarantees to the Baltic States, without stumbling into a war with Russia.

Yet Conradi’s lessons still seem to be unheard in Washington policy circles. I hope that those charged with Russia and Eurasia policy read closely his chapters dealing with the “Trap” (how Moscow baited Georgia into the disastrous 2008 war) and the Ukraine crisis. In both cases, Conradi details how Russia took decisive steps before U.S. plans reached fruition.

It is a reminder that along Russia’s periphery, the United States does not control the timetable of events. No doubt there are plenty of powerpoint presentations in Washington detailing how the United States will reconstruct the Ukrainian army and make the Ukrainian government more effective; what will be lacking will be what to do when Russia intervenes again to frustrate those plans.

Conradi’s work was written as the Donald Trump administration was just taking office, and some of the assumptions about Trump’s likely policies towards Russia have been upended over the last several months, most notably with the departure of Michael Flynn as national security advisor. But even if the composition of the Trump national security team changes, and begins to favor Russia-skeptics over Trump’s initial instinct to engage the Kremlin, his administration must still deal with the Russia that has emerged in 2017.

Conradi shows why we cannot continue discussing the past 25 years and lamenting missed opportunities of the past while holding out the hope of “resetting” to some past point in time, just as Russians cannot keep complaining about NATO expansion, the Kosovo operation, and the Iraq and Afghan wars. The post-Cold War relationship did not work out as a Russian-American partnership as many had hoped for, starting with what veteran Cold War warrior and Reagan administration defense official Fred Iklé articulated for in 1990. There is no point in lamenting this past. We have to consider what opportunities—if any—lie in the future.

We Have To Take Russia’s Provocations In Eastern Europe Seriously,"While all eyes have been on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the ongoing conflict in Syria, where Russia recently warned it will track and target any U.S. or coalition aircraft flying west of the Euphrates River, Russia continues its escalation in eastern Europe. After all, it is in eastern Europe, not the Middle East, where Moscow is determined to reclaim its sphere of influence, and, in the case of Crimea, move borders. But as it does so, the U.S. reaction is split between a distracted president and a concerned administration.

On Tuesday, Ukraine’s president Petro Poroshenko visited Washington DC, amid confusion about whether or not he would be meeting with President Donald Trump. His visit was officially being hosted by Vice President Mike Pence, but Trump was reportedly hesitant about meeting with Poroshenko himself. In the end, the White House opted for a brief “drop-in” to see Trump and national security adviser H.R. McMaster.

Trump’s reluctance to host an official visit with the Ukrainian president is a sign that he’s avoiding taking a firm stance on the war in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russians in 2014. It’s troubling that the president isn’t taking a more forceful line on the issue, but not altogether surprising. Trump was fairly open during his campaign that he wanted to see more engagement with Russia, something against which both Republicans and Democrats rightly balked.

There’s Still A War Going On In Ukraine

Recall that there is still a war going on in Ukraine. This week, the New York Times turned the spotlight on this little-noticed conflict:

“All told, the conflict has displaced between two million and three and a half million people. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, at least 1.6 million Ukrainians moved west toward Ukraine’s capital, Kiev as a result of the fighting. Russia says that 2.6 million Ukrainians moved east. In its report ending March 12, the refugee agency also estimated that from mid-April 2014 to mid-March 2017, at least 9,940 people have been killed and 23,455 wounded.”

There are signs, too, that Russia could be looking to reinvigorate what it calls a natural uprising of Russian-speaking Ukrainians. The Atlantic Council reported in March that Russia appears to be positioning itself for a large-scale military operation against Ukraine:

On March 8, Moscow announced that the Russian Navy would prioritize ships capable of carrying troops that can perform amphibious operations, which could easily be used against Ukraine, the Balkans, the Caucasus, or in the Middle East. On the weekend of March 24, observers recorded dozens of tanks deploying at Pokrovskoye in the southern Rostov-On-the Don region near Ukraine. At the same time, Russia deployed airborne forces (VDV) to Belarus, making it impossible for Ukraine to reroute forces from its north to its threatened southern frontier around Mariupol. And those VDV forces also clearly threaten an invasion of Belarus.

Even if Trump isn’t convinced of the obvious threat Russia poses to Ukraine, the rest of the administration is pretty clearly siding with Ukraine, as it should be. Poroshenko was reportedly given a warm reception at the Pentagon. More importantly, the same day as Poroshenko’s visit, the Treasury Department announced the addition of 38 people and entities to its sanctions list, including two Russian government officials, and said that these sanctions would not be lifted until Russia leaves Crimea.

Trump’s Administration Can’t Give Russia a Pass

Moscow is of course very displeased with these new sanctions. On Wednesday, Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov said that he has cancelled a planned meeting with the U.S. undersecretary of state, citing the sanctions. Ryabkov said, “the situation is not conducive to holding a round of this dialogue.” The meeting was scheduled for Friday.

The Treasury’s announcement comes in addition to the Senate passage of a bill last week that would tighten sanctions against Russia while also restricting the extent to which the president can lift those sanctions. This move was seen as a reaction against Trump seeking ways to lift sanctions on Russia when he first arrived at the White House, although the bill could get stuck in the House.

The Senate’s nearly unanimous vote allays some concerns that a Trump presidency would mean giving Russia a pass for all its meddling both here in the U.S. and throughout the Baltic states, the Balkans, and Ukraine. It shows that even if Trump wants to be soft on Russia, he’ll have a hard time doing so with a Congress that appears to have bipartisan consensus on how to handle a revanchist Moscow.

Ukraine Is Just Part Of Russia’s Belligerence

But Ukraine is just part of the picture. The situation in the Baltic states—Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia—continues to escalate. Last week, NATO announced that it would deploy four multinational battalions to the three Baltic states, plus Poland, in order to send a signal to the Kremlin that it is prepared to defend alliance members. Over the weekend, the U.S. participated in the largest NATO drill in Poland since the end of the Cold War, and the first of its size on the border region between Poland and Lithuania, a weak spot if Russia ever decided to cut off the Baltic states from the rest of Europe.

But NATO’s war games, in which about 1,500 troops participated, are nothing compared to the war games Russia has planned for September. Russia’s drill, codename “Zapad” (west), which it conducts every year although never on this scale, could involve as many 100,000 troops and will take place in Russia and Belarus.

Russia has also taken to repeatedly “buzzing” U.S. plans in the Baltics. On Monday, a Russian fighter jet came within five feet of a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the Baltic sea. The military said this incident was particularly noteworthy because of the “unsafe” manner of the flight, which it described as “provocative” and “erratic.” On Wednesday, a NATO military plane buzzed a plane carrying Russia’s defense minister. NATO claims it has begun monitoring flights in the area due to “an unusually large number of Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea” lately.

Congress and the Treasury Department can and should continue to push for sanctions against Russia for its ongoing provocations in eastern Europe. But as things continue to escalate toward a tipping point, the Trump administration will need to decide on a policy for how to react in the case of another blatant act of Russian aggression along the lines of the annexation of Crimea. That will require putting D.C. manpower behind policy planning. It could also be helped by the media looking up from the ongoing Russian election probe and the Syrian civil war long enough to see that Moscow is busily—and happily—pursuing a much more important strategy in eastern Europe.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/26/take-russias-provocations-eastern-europe-seriously/,2017-06-26
"The 1980s Called, And They Want Their Russia Sanctions Back","One unfortunate outgrowth of the way the United States formulates its national security policy is the tendency to view the “battle” in Washington as the centerpiece, with the actual foreign policy effects relegated to a sideline. The debate over whether to institutionalize (and increase) sanctions on Russia has followed this pattern, with Congress’s passage of legislation over the objections of President Donald Trump viewed primarily as a domestic political “humiliating rebuke” to the administration rather than as a step that has significant foreign policy implications to the United States.

Many seem to view the heavy lifting as over and done, with all that remains to count the days until Vladimir Putin is ousted from power and Russia meekly withdraws its forces from Ukraine and Syria. In contrast to the years of careful preparation and negotiation with other key partners over the Iran sanctions, which the latest legislation took as a template, the expanded Russia sanctions have come at a low point in U.S. relations with its allies and an increased lack of trust in American leadership, calling into question how effective they will be in the absence of a new trans-Atlantic (and trans-Pacific) consensus on how to move forward.

The gamble of Congress’s approach is that the United States can put back together the coalition of states it assembled to defeat the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The problem is that, despite all the nostalgia for the 1980s—and the consistent slips by many U.S. officials who still refer to the “Soviet Union”—we aren’t living in 1985. The Russian Federation of 2017 is a smaller and weaker state than its Soviet predecessor, but paradoxically that also makes the Moscow of today far less threatening to a number of key countries than it was 30 years ago, even if a post-Soviet Russia is still the biggest kid on the immediate Eurasian block. That has important geopolitical ramifications.

Alienating Russia Is Good for China

For one thing, the Soviet threat was perhaps the biggest factor inducing the People’s Republic of China to avoid creating problems with the United States and its allies. China has always claimed extensive maritime zones in the South and East China Seas; the difference was that when the Soviet Union posed an existential threat to Beijing, the Chinese leadership was not particularly interested in ginning up problems with Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian states over disputed islands and the Nine-Dash Line.

Today, China no longer fears that a post-Soviet Russia poses a threat to its ascendancy in East Asia, and is more interested in preventing Moscow from becoming part of an encircling coalition of states. As much as many American analysts deride the Obama administration’s effort to “reset” relations with Russia as a failure, it did create heartburn in Beijing because of the prospects that Moscow might develop a closer partnership with Washington.

U.S. sanctions, in contrast, are welcomed by China. Not only does it drive Russia closer to China, it guarantees that China’s northern and western frontiers are safeguarded, while any U.S. pivot back to Europe to deal with a resurging Russia takes away from the American rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.

Seeing all of this, Japan is also not enthusiastic about new U.S. sanctions. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the principal threat to Japan; today, Russia is seen as a necessary counterbalance in northeast Asia. Japanese geoeconomic strategy calls for investment in the Russian Far East to harvest resources Japan needs for its economy (and to prevent them from all going southward to China) and to give Moscow options so as not to be driven into any shotgun marriage with Beijing.

Japan reluctantly joined its G-7 partners to impose initial sanctions on Russia after its activities in Ukraine but is not interested in ceding an economic relationship with Moscow to the Chinese, especially if, as the Russian government continues to dangle in front of Tokyo, there could be a settlement of the territorial disputes between the two nations over the Kuril Islands.

Russia’s Position in the Middle East Has Shifted

In 1985, the Soviet Union did not have diplomatic relations with Israel and was the purveyor both of Marxist revolution and militant atheism, two ideologies absolutely anathema to the Saudi Arabian monarchy. Today, Russia has a de facto strategic partnership with Israel and its conservative religiosity at home and denunciation of democracy promotion abroad are music to the ears of the dynasts of the House of Al-Saud. Both see Moscow as an important restraining force on the impetuousness of the Islamic Republic of Iran and as the likely guarantor of any Syria settlement.

The Saudis already had their bout of ’80s nostalgia when the previous government, in consultation with the United States, tried to flood global markets with oil at the end of 2014 in an effort to put economic pressure on a Russia assumed to be addicted to high energy prices to fuel its foreign policy. The end result boomeranged on the Saudis, who watched their own coffers shrink. Today, the Moscow-Riyadh axis, coordinated by the new crown prince, is attempting to stabilize world energy prices and to solidify a price “floor” that can guarantee minimum levels of revenue to both governments’ treasuries.

The Turkish Republic in 1985 saw the Soviet Union as an implacable foe and viewed itself as the easternmost bastion of the Euro-Atlantic world. A more Islamic-flavored Turkey today is less inclined to see itself as the beachhead of a Western world which itself is ambivalent about Turkey’s membership, while a geographically reduced Russia opens the possibility for a more equal partnership between Ankara and Moscow.

The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan gets no lectures on democracy from Putin, while Turkish business is bedazzled by the prospect of their country becoming one of the world’s leading transit countries for energy—and eager to take away revenues from Ukraine, in keeping with Moscow’s stated goal of stopping all energy exports via Ukraine within two years. The Turkish military, already transformed by years of AKP Party governance, is less reflexively pro-American and more willing to work with Russia on good old-fashioned spheres of influence in Syria and other parts of the Middle East.

Europe Is Less Afraid of Russia Now

The biggest change, of course, is in Europe. Thirty years ago, even far-off states like Portugal or Iceland were concerned about Soviet intentions. Today, there is a direct correlation between how close a country borders to Russia and its perception of threat. Ukraine may face an existential threat from Russia, and countries like Latvia or Georgia must contemplate the prospect of Russian domination of their affairs, but Germans, Dutch, and Belgians aren’t living under the shadow of a mad dash of Red Army tank divisions through the Fulda Gap to the English Channel.

Indeed, west of the Oder-Neisse line, there may be disgust with how the Russians conduct their affairs and annoyance at Moscow’s policies and actions (especially in Ukraine and Syria), but not a great deal of existential angst. At the same time, European solidarity is under strain, complicating the argument that if one European state has a problem with Moscow it becomes a problem for every European state.

At the same time, for many European companies, Russia is an important market and a critical source of energy and raw materials. Germany, for the last several years, has articulated a rationale for existing sanctions on Russia: exacting penalties for its transgressions in Ukraine, but not designed to provoke economic collapse in Russia itself or to create unnecessary hardships in Europe—with the hope that at some point, a more productive Europe-Russia partnership can be restored. The latest U.S. sanctions are viewed with considerable distrust in some European capitals and boardrooms, as less motivated by defending principles of international law and more about promoting U.S. economic interests.

This Is Why the World Doesn’t Take Us Seriously

Thus, while the United States has tightened up its sanctions, others are looking for new loopholes. A Japanese consortium looking to drill in the waters of the Russian Far East is calculating where wells can be sited that will avoid triggering the sanctions restrictions on “deepwater” activities (if deepwater is defined as 150 meters or more). Norway’s Statoil takes European bans on cooperation with the Russians on shale oil literally, as prohibiting oil obtained from shale formations, not unconventional oil found in limestone deposits.

Germany, Italy, and other countries are willing to consider “national interest” waivers for their companies to move ahead with Russian energy projects. One German interlocutor once remarked to me that Berlin could take America’s protestations more seriously if and when the United States ever imposed serious sanctions on Saudi Arabia for its human rights violations. I have heard echoes of this view of Russia as “Europe’s Saudi Arabia” in other trans-Atlantic dialogues as well.

None of this suggests that there is much enthusiasm among America’s closest partners for stricter economic restrictions on Moscow, and Congress does not show much interest in trying to incentivize other states to go along with our plans (for instance, subsidizing U.S. shale gas to make it more competitive with Russian pipeline gas).

The next several months will prove to be very interesting indeed. A Trump administration that is unenthusiastic about the new congressional mandates will have to negotiate with allies and friends who are themselves unenthused about further ruptures in their relations with Russia. It doesn’t sound like a great deal.

We Still Have Zero Evidence That Trump Colluded With Russia,"CNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd, who worked for the FBI when now-special counsel Robert Mueller was the director, should have caused a bigger stir when he appeared to threaten President Trump: “Let me give you one bottom line as a former government official, the government is going to kill this guy.”

That’s because the president “defends Vladimir Putin,” Mudd said. After a few comments of agreement, CNN’s Jake Tapper made sure Mudd was speaking in a “metaphor.” “Obviously,” Mudd replied. “What I’m saying is government — people talk about the deep state — when you disrespect government officials who’ve done 30 years, they’re going to say, ‘Really’?”

The intelligence community seems to have it out for Donald Trump—but why? This CNN exchange was about Trump’s tongue-in-cheek response to Russia sending home U.S. embassy officials and spooks, Russia’s response to the latest bout of sanctions from Congress.

But the ire goes much deeper. Before the G20 summit, an NBC reporter asked Trump if he would definitively say that Russia interfered in the American election. Despite the U.S. intelligence community insisting otherwise, President Trump refused to place sole blame on Russia, adding that “nobody really knows for sure.”

In the beltway, this is unacceptable conspiracy-peddling that all but proves Trump-Russia collusion. After Trump’s G20 comments, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough took time away from his budding music career to chide Trump on Facebook for “attacking US intelligence patriots.” Chuck Todd took to Twitter to call this yet another capitulation to Putin. These are but a few examples.

The problem with all this? Trump is 100 percent correct when he says, more or less, that although Russia would love to meddle in American elections, and probably did meddle to some extent, there is a troubling lack of proof that Russia was behind the release of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails and files to WikiLeaks, or the phishing of John Podesta’s email.

This isn’t just about the legitimacy of Trump’s election, or whether he will be impeached. The degree to which Russia interfered in the election affects the pace of Trump’s policy agenda, our foreign policy, our defense budget, and even the chances of open war between the world’s two predominant nuclear powers. Getting to the truth of what happened in the 2016 election could even affect the future of the republic. Because of this, the unanswered questions surrounding Russia’s election interference should trouble every American.

Russian DNC and RNC Hacking in Late 2015

Start in 2015, when the Russian hacking began, before Trump was the Republican nominee. According to reports, a sole FBI agent contacted the DNC in September 2015 to notify them of hacking, possibly tied to Russia. The DNC claims that because their employee didn’t believe the caller was an FBI agent, the employee didn’t return the agent’s subsequent calls. At this point, hackers were also attempting to enter the RNC’s systems.

Around this time the DNC hired cybersecurity consultants from Good Harbor Security Risk Management, which provided a list of recommendations for improving DNC cybersecurity. The DNC failed to take action on any of the consultants’ recommendations. Further, although Russian hackers were allegedly already in the DNC network at the time, Good Harbor did not discover any hackers in its review.

In December 2015, the failure of an internal firewall at the DNC allowed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign staffers to access team Clinton voter data. This led to a brawl that reached its zenith when team Bernie lost its access to the data, then retaliated by suing the DNC.

The DNC Announces Russia Hacked It

As a result, the DNC hired the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike in early 2016, which released their findings on the Bernie staffers’ misdeeds in April 2016, with no mention of any Russian intrusion. Only days later, however, CrowdStrike allegedly found evidence of Russian hackers in the DNC’s computers, after the hackers had accessed opposition research on then-candidate Trump. CrowdStrike and the DNC did not make public their claims of Russian hacking until mid-June of 2016.

Specifically, on June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks head Julian Assange announced that he had Hillary Clinton-related documents. On June 14, the DNC released news of the DNC’s hacking, blaming Russia. On June 15, anonymous hacker “Guccifer 2.0” claimed responsibility for the DNC hack and claimed to be the WikiLeaks source. Guccifer 2.0 started posting documents outside of WikiLeaks on June 15, 2016, and continued posting documents over the next couple months. WikiLeaks began publishing on July 22.

An important distinction must be made here. WikiLeaks posted information showing DNC staff were targeting Sanders to benefit Clinton’s campaign. This created a lot of friction, especially since the release occurred right before the Democrat National Convention. When you heard about materials gained from “Russian hacking” in the news, the materials came from WikiLeaks.

Guccifer 2.0’s releases, on the other hand, were in all likelihood a non-factor. They were also largely obtained from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), not the DNC. You likely did not hear about Guccifer 2.0’s files in the news.

A list of Guccifer’s materials include congressional passwords to news services, Lexis, and a federal courts public access system called PACER; a list of Democratic donors from 2005, files on a Democrat donor jailed in 2009, and files on a disgraced lobbyist’s donations to Republicans; opposition research on Sarah Palin and information that somewhat placed Barack Obama in a bad light; along with information on House races and candidates, almost all of it inconsequential. Guccifer also had a habit of lying, including that he or she had gained access to the Clinton Foundation donor list, when really the donors released were to the DCCC.

In other words, don’t conflate Guccifer 2.0 with WikiLeaks. Although it is possible that the two were affiliated entities in Russia’s election-interference campaign, the two groups released very different materials in consequence and scope. More on this later.

CrowdStrike and the DNC

Back at the DNC, between April, when the Russian hacking was allegedly discovered, and June, when news of the hacking went public, CrowdStrike proceeded to clean or replace all of the DNC servers. Because of this, direct confirmation of the DNC hack did not come from the FBI, but only from CrowdStrike.

According to former FBI Director James Comey, the FBI made “multiple requests at different levels” to examine the DNC servers, but the DNC refused. Ultimately, the FBI reached an agreement with the DNC that, in Comey’s words, a “highly respected private company” would report to the FBI what it found in the DNC servers.

CrowdStrike has also been wrong about Russian hacking in the past.

This is odd. Checking out the DNC servers, especially with an election and U.S. national security on the line, should be the FBI’s job. Next, CrowdStrike had incentives that might conflict with an honest assessment. Because CrowdStrike was being paid by the DNC, not taxpayers, it had a clear incentive to report whatever the DNC wanted it to report. The DNC had a political incentive to blame the hacking on Russia, which allowed the Clinton team to first falsely claim that the documents were heavily doctored or even wholly manufactured, then pivot to attacking Trump as a Putin stooge whenever WikiLeaks material came up.

Most important, CrowdStrike has a monetary incentive to find something big when skunking out hackers—the better to get its name in the public domain and go on to bigger and better contracts. In the words of Jeffrey Carr, a cybersecurity consultant who has lectured at the U.S. Army War College: “The only things that pay in the cybersecurity world are claims of attribution. Which foreign government attacked you? If you are critical of the attack, you make zero money. CrowdStrike is the poster child for companies that operate like this.”

Remember the Sony hack, supposedly perpetrated by North Korea? CrowdStrike was sure that North Korea was behind the hack, even though cybersecurity experts pointed out the evidence was thin and it was equally likely that the “hack” was the work of an insider.

CrowdStrike has also been wrong about Russian hacking in the past. Crowdstrike reported in December 2016 that the same malware used in the DNC attack had infected Ukrainian military Android devices and tracked and targeted Ukrainian artillery units. This allowed CrowdStrike to upgrade their assessment of the DNC hack to a “high degree of certainty.”

The only problem? No such “hacking” took place, and it could even be argued that by making the Ukrainian military doubt its equipment, the CrowdStrike report temporarily aided the Russian-backed rebels. CrowdStrike was roundly criticized by the Ukrainian government and cybersecurity experts as a result.

The Podesta Email Theft and Obama’s Response

After news of the DNC hacking, U.S. officials publicly expressed reticence to positively blame Russia for the DNC hacking, rightly not wanting to base U.S. national security assessments on the work of a private cybersecurity firm with ties to the Clinton campaign.

This changed in early August, when, according to the Washington Post, President Obama received a double-secret report from the CIA that Russia was indeed attempting to influence the election in favor of Trump. The NSA did not attach a high degree of confidence to the intelligence due to the nature of the source (likely an Eastern European intelligence agency), and the White House sat on the information. That changed on October 7, the very day WikiLeaks released the Podesta emails, when the Obama administration officially blamed Russia for both the DNC hack and the Podesta email theft.

There are several discrepancies to this tale. First, the Podesta email theft resulted from a ploy that tricked Podesta into giving the “hacker” his Gmail password. Phishing, the method used, isn’t hacking per se. It works by getting the victim to type his or her password into a “fake” website. Although Russian hacking groups have used the fake link trick before, saying that it can only be used by Russians is a stretch. In the words of Sam Biddle, “this isn’t a Russian technique any more than using a computer is a Russian technique.”

Although Russian hacking groups have used the fake link trick before, saying that it can only be used by Russians is a stretch.

It should also be questioned whether the Obama administration used the Podesta phishing to assess that Russia was behind the separate DNC hack, and why the Obama administration picked the very day of the Podesta email release to officially make its assessment.

Second, WikiLeaks’ Podesta email release occurred just hours after NBC released the infamous Trump-Billy Bush tape. Thus some say the Podesta emails were only released at this time to distract the hayseeds in flyover country from Trump’s vulgarity. Actually, everyone knew that WikiLeaks was set to release that day, and the NBC tape could have been shot to distract from the Podesta email trove.

Either way, the U.S. intelligence community never presented much proof, and even worse seemed to be working from the assessment of a private cybersecurity firm that had conveniently supplied the Clinton-campaign with much needed talking points for when the DNC or Podesta emails came up. During this time, former CIA director Michael Morell and former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden were calling Trump, in Morell’s words, “an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”

The Forensic Evidence of Russian Hacking

After the election, the Obama administration prompted U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct a conclusive review of Russian meddling in the election. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a report in December, and the director of national intelligence (DNI), which coordinates the appendages of the intelligence bureaucracy, released a report in January. These reports were supposed to contain definitive proof of Russian hacking.

Forensic evidence from CrowdStrike provided in the FBI and DHS report labeled the Russian cyber-campaign “Grizzly Steppe.” The Grizzly Steppe report, as proof of Russian interference, listed malware, called X-Agent, along with other “signatures,” such as hacking tools used to sort files.

One of the tools detected was attributed to the Russian government, but is commonly and widely used by hackers all over Russia and Ukraine.

CrowdStrike and the FBI reasoned that because X-Agent had been used to hack Germany’s Bundestag and a French TV network, then X-Agent must be tied to the Russian government. There are two obvious problems with this line of reasoning. First, we don’t know with certainty that the Russian government was behind the European hacks.

Second, in Carr’s words, “It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as CrowdStrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will.”

This is true across the board. For example, one of the tools detected was attributed to the Russian government, but is commonly and widely used by hackers all over Russia and Ukraine. So little in the CrowdStrike forensics pointed to the Russian government with any modicum of certainty. Matt Taibbi at Rolling Stone called the report “long on jargon and short on specifics.”

Dan Goodin at Ars Technica summed up the report: “Instead of providing smoking guns that the Russian government was behind specific hacks, it largely restates previous private-sector claims without providing any support for their validity. Even worse, it provides an effective bait and switch by promising newly declassified intelligence into Russian hackers’ ‘tradecraft and techniques’ and instead delivering generic methods carried out by just about all state-sponsored hacking groups.”

As to the two pages that did cover the supposed Russian hack of the DNC, cybersecurity and intelligence experts widely held the report to be underwhelming at best.

Robert Lee, former Air Force cyberwarfare officer and cybersecurity fellow at New America, and Errata Security CEO Rob Graham believe the generous verdict is that the FBI and DHS left out more conclusive evidence. Lee believes the report was likely rushed. Graham concluded that the forensics “can be a reflection of the fact the government has excellent information for attribution. Or, it could be a reflection that they’ve got only weak bits and pieces. It’s impossible for us outsiders to tell.”

CrowdStrike’s weak forensic evidence even led to the somewhat-laughable caper where a Vermont utility found a code listed in the report on a laptop, which prompted the Washington Post to run a story about Russians hacking the electrical grid, with quotes from breathless Vermont Democrats decrying the Russian threat. In the end, it became apparent that the malware wasn’t associated with the Russians, that the laptop wasn’t connected to the grid, and that the illustrious Washington Post hadn’t bothered to contact the Vermont utility before publishing.

The DNI report, out in January 2017, was no better. While all except the NSA pinned the DNC and Podesta hacks on Russia with a high degree of confidence, the report forgot to include any new information. A third of the DNI report was devoted to decrying RT, the Russian-owned cable channel that nobody watches. The report went on to make the ludicrous claim that Russia peddled propaganda such as “Hillary’s no-fly zone risked starting a war with Russia,” when this was a legitimate concern many voters and members of Congress held, given a no-fly zone would require that American airpower shoot down Russian aircraft over Syria.

As to the two pages that did cover the supposed Russian hack of the DNC, cybersecurity and intelligence experts widely held the report to be underwhelming at best. Much of it was yet again a regurgitation of techy-sounding but generic terms.

Flynn, Comey, and Trump Collusion

Before the election, a separate but connected narrative began to emerge, also pushed if not originated by Clinton’s campaign: since Russia had interfered in the election, maybe Trump was more than just an unwitting stooge of the Kremlin. As proof of this was the story—now largely disproven despite resurrection attempts by the media—that a Russian bank was communicating with a server in Trump Tower. We also know that during this time the BuzzFeed Trump-Russia dossier had made its way to the FBI.

Grassley is wondering why the FBI paid the former British agent for garbage opposition research.

Ostensibly because of this, a shell-shocked post-election Obama administration moved to allow any “information” on Trump’s “possible collusion with Russia” to be disseminated widely down the daisy-chain of command in the federal intelligence bureaucracies. This enabled widespread leaking and is likely what snared Michael Flynn, when his non-nefarious intercepted communication with the Russian ambassador was illegally leaked, contradicting what he had told the vice president.

Since then have been three big developments. First, there was the unverified and error-ridden BuzzFeed dossier, compiled by a discredited former British agent and paid for by Fusion GPS, a firm with ties to the Kremlin and a history of smearing conservatives and opponents of Planned Parenthood. Fusion GPS also has ties to Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian lawyer and former Russian intelligence agent, respectively, who met with Donald Jr. under the guise of promising dirt on Clinton just days before the DNC made the theft of its files public.

Currently, Fusion GPS is stonewalling Chuck Grassley’s Senate investigators. Grassley is wondering why the FBI paid the former British agent, who went on to pay Russian agents, and in so doing entertained garbage opposition research partially written using the ol’ copy-paste trick from Google and Wikipedia.

This constant drip from anonymous intelligence officials has perpetuated the narrative that Russia not only hacked the election, but that President Trump also colluded with the Russians.

Second, there was the firing of James Comey, likely because Comey was not cooperating with Congress’ investigation into the illegal leaks by intelligence officials, and the Obama administration’s unmasking of Americans’ communications. It is also likely that Trump was upset after Comey seemed to tell Congress, under oath, that President Trump was under FBI investigation, when he had told Trump privately that he was not.

Third, there was the appointment of a special counsel, former FBI director and pal of James Comey Robert Mueller, who is tasked with investigating Trump’s ties with Russia. This was only made possible by Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal from all matters related to Russia, after anonymous leaks brought into question how many times Sessions had met with the Russians during the 2016 campaign.

On top of this there is the constant drip of unverified and anonymous leaks to The New York Times and Washington Post. The leaks are themselves laughable. The best example is the “backchannel” story, if you’ve ever read a history book about the halcyon Cold War days. Thrown together, however, this constant drip from anonymous intelligence officials has perpetuated the narrative that Russia not only hacked the election, but that President Trump also colluded with the Russians.

VIPS and Guccifer 2.0

One last bombshell dropped several weeks ago, and was picked up by Bloomberg View’s Leonid Bershidsky and The Nation, a leftwing publication. A group of former U.S. intelligence officials, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), has been investigating the alleged Russian hacking of the DNC and related intelligence reports. Several VIPS members are “famous” for questioning the Bush administration’s Iraq weapons of mass destruction claims before the 2003 War in Iraq, and were quoted by The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof.

Does this forensic evidence and the lack of forensic evidence from CrowdStrike warrant more investigation and explanation? Most definitely.

VIPS is around 30 members strong, some prominent and highly experienced former intelligence officials. It has been working with two outside sources. Remember Guccifer 2.0, and this hacker’s largely inconsequential files? Each source has managed to pull the metadata from the files, something akin to each file’s fingerprint.

The first source, the “Forensicator,” has found that on July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC’s server in 87 seconds, a rate of 22.7 megabytes per second. While it’s debatable, some say this speed is virtually impossible over the Internet, but it is definitely consistent with the transfer rate when downloading information to a USB thumb-drive. The Forensicator also found that time stamps in the metadata show that the download occurred at approximately 6:45 p.m. EST.

Adam Carter, the second source, found evidence in the metadata that the first five files Guccifer made public on June 15 had each been copied-and-pasted into a “Russianified [W]ord document with Russian language settings and style headings” to make it appear as if the Russian language was used in the hacking process. The traces of Russian found in the documents had been cited as the prime evidence that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian hacking group. Carter is examining the July 5, 2016 documents to see if they were doctored in a similar fashion, but has yet to find anything.

Who are these sources? The Forensicator is someone in the Pacific Time Zone, and VIPS believes this person is “someone very good with the FBI,” given the level of expertise. Carter is located in the United Kingdom, and the pseudonym is play off a character from a BBC espionage show titled “Spooks.”

How far does VIPS go down the rabbit hole? VIPS believes the DNC experienced an internal theft then went to war, creating “Guccifer 2.0” to point to Russia whenever the stolen DNC files came up. Is this fanciful? Probably. Does this forensic evidence and the lack of forensic evidence from CrowdStrike warrant more investigation and explanation? Most definitely.

Beltway Republican Talking Points

All this brings us to today, where the latest development in the Trump-Russia story more or less says that President Obama knew about Russian hacking and didn’t do enough to stop it. It is now conventional wisdom within the Beltway that the Obama administration dropped the ball, and maybe even cost Clinton the election. Even Democrat Adam Schiff, Congress’ latest reincarnation of Joe McCarthy, was on a Sunday show saying that the Obama administration didn’t do enough to combat Russian interference in the election.

Meanwhile, there is an ongoing dispute between the DNC, its former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the DHS and FBI over how much assistance the DNC was offered during and after the alleged Russian hacking.

Most Republicans have used this as an opportunity to jump on a traditional Republican talking point: “The Democrats are weak on national security, which explains why Obama didn’t act.” Maybe true, but these developments also highlight a flaw in the “Russia hacked the election story.” If such an unprecedented attack was taking place, why wasn’t more done to stop it?

There is one potential answer we don’t hear much about: The Obama administration and the FBI didn’t take major action because Russian interference was not as clear-cut as it is being made to seem post-election. What if Russia’s election hacking and preference for Trump has been grossly exaggerated? What if the Russians could have been behind the hacks, but the only hard evidence is inconclusive?

More Evidence Before We Jump to Conclusions

Because of all the unanswered questions, most people known to the author here in flyover country—Republicans and Democrats alike—treat the intelligence community with a big healthy dose of skepticism. Too many in the Beltway fail to do the same. The GOP’s deference to intelligence agencies especially shows in the Senate, particularly the Senate Intelligence Committee. There is a reason Comey testified here, and not on Grassley’s Judiciary Committee.

Just for example, when Comey claimed during his hearings that CrowdStrike was such a high-class cybersecurity outfit that it didn’t matter that the FBI didn’t actually examine the DNC servers, there was no follow-up question.

Everybody knows what the NSA sucks up, and where the FBI spies, so there should be little problem with the government divulging any other forensic evidence found on the DNC’s computers.

Beltway types say more evidence is being withheld due to the fear of compromising “sources and methods.” But this isn’t the Cold War, where we risk exposing a human spy hiding in the Kremlin. Everybody knows what the NSA sucks up, and where the FBI spies, so there should be little problem with the government divulging any other forensic evidence found on the DNC’s computers, as has been done for previous hacking episodes perpetrated by state actors.

In the words of William Binney, a former NSA technical director and designer of many programs now in use, “Everything that they say must remain classified is already well-known; they’re playing the Wizard of Oz game.” Cybersecurity experts have mused that maybe Congress has been given more info, but members of Congress also seem left in the dark about CrowdStrike’s analysis, and clearly the president himself is ignorant of the undisclosed silver-bullet information that proves Russian interference.

Even the idea that Trump is better for Putin, so Putin wanted Trump elected, is laughable. If this is true, Putin is the real “useful idiot.” Putin’s lifeblood is oil and natural gas. We are to believe he just helped elect the most pro-energy U.S. president in decades, who plans on exporting oodles of cheap U.S. natural gas to U.S.-allied Europe?

Ditto for the revelation, first from the affably named Reality Winner, that Russian hackers got into state databases. Sure, Russia would do this, and probably did, but the only cybersecurity issue aired publicly after the election came from Georgia, Indiana, and Idaho election officials, who traced an attempted hack in their systems back to a computer at the Obama administration’s DHS (DHS has plausibly disputed at least the Georgia incident).

There’s obviously a good explanation for all of this, but given that there is a good explanation, why would state officials be complaining to the media about the DHS while they were under massive attack by Russian hackers? Wouldn’t state officials worry that they would end up looking stupid, or even losing their jobs? Is it possible that they were not properly informed by DHS, or that the hacking was less widespread than is currently being reported?

As for the reporting on state election infrastructure hacking, far too many breathless news outlets forgot to mention that little proof has been publicly provided for this episode of Russian hacking, either. It is all too likely that Russia really did hack state election databases (they certainly would like to), but, again, let’s hear the evidence before we pass sanctions that will harm our European allies, or start calling a U.S. presidential election illegitimate.

In all this, congressional Democrats, the beltway media, and too many Republican senators are woefully out of touch with the American people. It goes a long way to explain why President Trump won both the GOP nomination, and the general election. Worse, right on Russian hacking or not, is the degree to which the unelected U.S. intelligence community has been influencing policy decisions. Too many Republicans have been completely silent on this.

The American people in flyover country no longer trust any of these groups. If we can’t even trust the FBI to give an honest assessment of the Alexandria shooter’s motives, why should we trust everything the intelligence bureaucracies say if insufficient evidence is provided? What sounds like an oaf mouthing pro-Putin blather to some sounds like common sense in flyover country.

This is not the fault of flyover country. They have grown cynical for good reason. To win back its trust, start by providing more evidence to justify invalidating their political choices.

13 Questions About The Wiretapping Of Paul Manafort,"Monday’s CNN exclusive detailing that former Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was wiretapped by the government is a bombshell that raises many questions about the motives and method of such surveillance.

We know that Manafort has reportedly been the focus of Robert Mueller’s investigation for some time, including details of a dawn raid reported in the New York Times. What is less clear is the exact nature of this wiretap, the time period that it was running on Manafort, the justification by which it was restarted after a reported gap, and the identities of others—including potentially the then-president-elect—caught up during this surveillance period by the government.

Yesterday, Manafort’s spokesman released the following statement:

If true, it is a felony to reveal the existence of a FISA warrant, regardless of the fact that no charges ever emerged. The U.S Department of Justice’s Inspector General should immediately conduct an investigation into these leaks and to examine the motivations behind a previous Administration’s effort to surveil a political opponent. Mr. Manafort requests that the Department of Justice release any intercepts involving him and any non-Americans so interested parties can come to the same conclusion as the DOJ – there is nothing there.

Now let’s be clear about what this doesn’t mean: if the institutional firewalls function as intended, being surveilled by the FBI and being surveilled directly by the Obama administration are different things. This does not confirm a “wiretap of Trump” as the president’s now-infamous tweet read. But as we’ve seen with the case of Susan Rice’s potentially unjustified unmasking of Trump transition officials, that’s something where skepticism is certainly warranted.

Here, though, are 13 questions that I have, given the CNN report and others that have emerged about this surveillance of Manafort, in no particular order. I believe these questions deserve to be answered, in front of Congress or in the public square:

1. When, exactly, was Paul Manafort wiretapped by the government?

2. Did the wiretap cease when Manafort became Trump’s campaign chairman in March 2016, and did it resume after he ceased to have this role in August 2016, or did it overlap?

3. Was the FBI wiretap steady in the months before March 2016, before he had any official affiliation with the Trump campaign, during which time he was reportedly talking regularly with Trump and living in Trump Tower?

4. Given that Manafort lived there, did the wiretap cover Trump Tower—yes or no?

5. When was the wiretap renewed? On whose orders was the request made, and what new justification was involved?

6. If the evidence contained within the conversations the government wiretapped were indeed “not conclusive” about acts of collusion, as two sources tell CNN, why was the wiretap renewed (presuming that was the case) after Manafort left the campaign? Was it investigating the same activity, or new ones?

7. This was a 2014-based investigation given Manafort’s activity on behalf of a Vladimir Putin-friendly political party in Ukraine at the time. Back in April the Podesta Group revised their FARA reporting on their involvement in that Ukraine election, when their activity was directed by Manafort. Was the Podesta Group or any of its officials included in any wiretaps in 2016?

8. The piece says that the wiretapping, which related to Manafort’s work in Ukraine, was “discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence,” but that “The FBI then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year.” What evidence precipitated the request for that new warrant? Presumably not new work for Ukraine. Why the change?

9. Was there anything that changed in the intervening time preceding the restart of the investigation other than the role Manafort played with the Trump campaign in 2016?

10. Was any of the justification contained within the application for the wiretap’s renewal dependent on the Steele Memo, whose many claims cannot be substantiated or have been significantly debunked? We know according to prior CNN reporting it was used for approval from a FISA court regarding Carter Page.

CNN reports: “The conversations between Manafort and Trump continued after the President took office, long after the FBI investigation into Manafort was publicly known, the sources told CNN. They went on until lawyers for the President and Manafort insisted that they stop, according to the sources. It’s unclear whether Trump himself was picked up on the surveillance.”

11. How could it be possible that Republican nominee, president-elect, or President Trump was NOT picked up on the surveillance of Manafort if the two talked by phone as frequently as has been reported?

12. Why did Attorney General Jeff Sessions say there was no basis for Trump’s tweet when it seems clear that in fact someone as senior as Manafort, working and operating within Trump Tower, was indeed wiretapped? It is possible he was being literal and specific. But if this wiretap did indeed pick up conversations with Trump, how did Sessions not know about it? Was his recusal part of that? Did it end prior to his confirmation?

13. Finally, why are we just learning about this now? Who is the person leaking information—illegally, as Manafort’s statement notes—about a FISA court-based investigation? Who benefits from this report, and what is his or her motivation in letting it be known?",https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/20/13-questions-wiretapping-paul-manafort/,2017-09-20
Is A George W. Trump Foreign Policy Sustainable?,"Donald Trump’s speech to the United Nations does its best to form a synthesis out of Steve Bannon’s nationalism and George W. Bush’s foreign policy, but it’s not exactly a coherent combination, and we can already see its blind spots.

It has been a bit odd to see Bush-era neoconservatives applauding Trump’s speech, but it’s easy to understand why. Trump trashed the Iran deal and threw down some deadly threats against North Korea, a relief after years of the Obama administration’s passivity. (President Obama loved what I call “off-ramp diplomacy“—always seeking the “off-ramp” that would not actually resolve a crisis but temporarily remove it from the president’s plate.) More deeply, though, Trump’s speech actually incorporates recognizable elements from Bush-era foreign policy, particularly on the subject of terrorism. Like this:

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban, and others that slaughter innocent people. The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.

With the exception of one distinctively Trumpian turn of phrase (calling terrorists “losers,” which I can’t really complain about), this is a hauntingly familiar recitation of the core of the Bush Doctrine.

That’s no surprise when you look at who is left in President Trump’s cabinet. He came into office surrounded by a coterie of quasi-isolationist “nationalists” in the mold of Bannon, but one by one they have been purged from the administration, including Bannon himself. Between Trump’s new chief of staff, John Kelly, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, national security policy in the Trump White House is now largely being shaped by men who rose during the Bush years and are sympathetic to its overall foreign policy goals.

This is not a subversion of our electoral system. It is the system working as intended. Our system requires that the president act through his advisors and cabinet officers, who are mostly drawn from senior figures with experience and a long track record in government. This makes it hard for one man to radically change the country’s ideological direction or long-term policy priorities—and that’s how things are supposed to work.

The only member of the “nationalist” camp remaining in the administration in any prominent position is Stephen Miller, a White House policy advisor and Trump’s chief speechwriter. So we can see in this speech the effort to merge elements of the Bush-era policy being re-established by top military and foreign policy strategists with the rhetoric of Bannonite nationalism.

Yet there is something lost in the synthesis. What is lost, primarily, is the central idea of a freedom agenda—the idea that freedom and representative government are crucially important to the peace and security of the world, to America’s vision for the direction it wants the world to go, and even for America’s own identity.

The central theme of Trump’s speech was “sovereignty,” which Trump defined in the following way:

We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is [the] foundation for cooperation and success.

Well, all right, but what should these sovereign states do with their sovereignty to ensure the flourishing of their citizens? We get no specific answer, but we can notice one glaring omission. At almost every point where Bush might have mentioned “freedom” or “democracy,” Trump substituted something else. He talked about “culture,” “needs,” “security,” “dignity,” “peace,” and above all “interests.” Thus, “we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures.” We need “strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace.” At the end, Trump summarizes his vision this way:

[S]trong, sovereign, and independent nations—nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.

Freedom is certainly mentioned at a few spots but pointedly missing at many others. Consider Trump’s peculiar exegesis of World War II: “We must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.”

So the defeat of an aggressive nationalist dictatorship, Nazi Germany, was really a victory for…nationalism? I can only think of one country that has long held precisely this perspective on World War II. It is the Russians, who view that war not primarily as the defeat of tyranny but as a defense of Mother Russia, as the Great Patriotic War. No, I’m not suggesting that Trump’s view of World War II is a result of Russian propaganda or “collusion.” Rather, it is the sign of a vague ideological affinity with Russian-style nationalism.

Trump is never more frightening than when he is talking about America’s own history, where he inevitably leaves out the most important bits. For example, he cites John Adams on the “revolution in the minds and hearts of the people” by which Americans “understood that we were a nation.” As far as America’s history and culture were concerned, the Americans viewed themselves as British right up to the end.

As late as 1774, Thomas Jefferson wrote a pamphlet proclaiming the “rights of British America,” and the Founders always described themselves as defending the traditional “rights of Englishmen.” America would not have separated from Britain on the basis of national identity or culture, because we were British. We separated from them on the basis of individual rights and limits on the power of government. You can look it up, because we actually published a declaration detailing these causes.

But Trump doesn’t tend to think of the world in these terms. He ends his speech with a call for “a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.” And here is how he defines patriotism:

Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?

Notice that liberty is not on the list. “Interests” and “culture,” but not liberty. Yet Americans have traditionally regarded liberty as the central defining characteristic of our civic culture and as our primary interest, particularly in foreign policy. From the beginning we defined ourselves as the global standard-bearer for liberty and the chief nemesis of tyranny.

Trump’s downgrading of our national interest in liberty leads him to specifically reject the promotion of liberty. In one passage, he says, “We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.” For those who follow this closely, what he’s saying is: democracy-promotion is out, the freedom agenda is out, we’re going back to the realpolitik of “shared interests.”

Yet this is not a position that can be consistently maintained in dealing with the actual condition of the world. The importance of liberty is not just an ivory tower abstraction but a longstanding pattern borne out by history. Countries without political freedom, countries that do not gain the “consent of the governed,” governments that impose themselves on their subjects for the purpose of plunder or arbitrary rule, are inherently illegitimate, and that lack of legitimacy makes them fundamentally unstable and insecure. Such regimes are a threat to every country around them, not only because of the internal chaos and turmoil they create, but because they usually seek to protect their predatory rule by expanding it to the countries around them.

Trump is implicitly forced to acknowledge this fact. Consider his cases against North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela. His well-deserved denunciations of these regimes all end up taking account of their internal policies. North Korea, he says, “is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.” On Iran, “Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever.” Or in a marvelous passage, Trump explains:

The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.

But if national sovereignty is the central principle of international relations, isn’t this sort of thing their own business? Why is it a concern of ours? In effect, Trump is required to acknowledge that it is the oppressive nature of the governments of these countries that makes them a threat to others. So in the case of Venezuela, he ends up saying that America’s goal and that of its allies “is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.”

That’s why this speech reads more like an attempt to synthesize two different approaches to foreign policy: a lot of the rhetoric of nationalist realpolitik, along with a lot of the substance of the Bush-era freedom agenda.

But there is one glaring blind spot where we can see the substantive impact of Trump’s nationalist leanings. If sovereignty is the key principle of international relations, one country that has recently committed gross violations of another nation’s sovereignty: attempting to rig its elections then seizing part of its territory and supporting a vicious, ongoing insurgency in its eastern provinces. This is what Russia has been doing to Ukraine since 2014. Yet Russia gets no mention in Trump’s litany of complaints about the world, and Ukraine gets only a vague, passing mention about “threats” to sovereignty.

I don’t think you need to engage in any speculation to see why Trump gives Russia a pass. His sympathy for Vladimir Putin and his outlook has long been clear, based on a similar conception of national sovereignty. Putin, too, is the sort of leader who would talk about a nation’s culture and interests as the basis for its sovereignty—and omit liberty and political freedom.

There has been a drumbeat on the Right for a long time to the effect that U.S. foreign policy should be based strictly on a narrow interpretation of our interests and drop all this stuff about promoting freedom in the world. This speech is a move in that direction.

A hybridized George W. Trump foreign policy forged between the president and his top advisors will probably be better in many respects than the not-so-benign neglect the last president practiced. But we can also see the incoherence and the blind spots that such a compromise creates—and the risk that what remains of America’s role as a standard-bearer for freedom in the world will be ignored by an unenthusiastic commander-in-chief.

7 Takeaways From Mueller’s Charges In Russia Collusion Probe,"Former Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 counts, including conspiracy to launder a whopping $75 million, and false and misleading federal filings. They pleaded not guilty on Monday. In addition, Trump foreign policy advisor George Papadopolous was revealed to have pleaded guilty to making false statements in an FBI interview about his discussions with Russia-related contacts earlier in the year.

Is this a huge deal? Is Trump on course to be impeached? Is it not that big of a deal and unrelated to the long-promised proof of Trump’s illegal ties to Russia? It depends on who you ask and may take some time to determine. Here are a few takeaways.

1. Whatever It Is, It’s Not Nothing

President Trump likes to say that Manafort wasn’t his campaign chairman for long. After Special Counsel Robert Mueller raided Manafort’s home this summer, Trump said, “He was with the campaign, as you know, for a very short period of time—for a relatively short period of time.”

That’s true, but the two have known each other for decades and Manafort was not just the Republican candidate’s campaign chairman, but chairman of the campaign at a very important time, from mid-May to mid-August of 2016. This time period included the fraught Republican Convention at which Manafort orchestrated a harsh shutdown of grassroots Republican opposition to Trump’s nomination.

Gates’ indictment relates to his work with Manafort, but he has his own relationship with Trump, including being an early visitor to the White House and the vice-chair of Trump’s Inaugural Committee.

The two are accused of laundering more than $75 million in foreign funds. However you slice it, two associates of Donald Trump getting caught up in a money laundering scheme is not going to burnish the president’s image.

2. What’s Not Surprising About The Indictments

Today was not the first day the world learned that Manafort and Gates might have engaged in some shady financial dealings. The whole reason Manafort stepped down from the campaign in the first place was the rash of unfavorable stories about the financial consequences of his work in Ukraine. “Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump’s Campaign Chief,” was one New York Times headline. In August of last year, my better half wrote about possible money laundering by Manafort.

In light of this previously well-known and widely published news, a single count of money laundering along with charges related to many process and filing violations is perhaps less than reasonable observers might have expected.

3. What Is Surprising About the Indictment

The relatively restrained indictment against Manafort and Gates is mostly built around Foreign Agents Registration Act violations. Similar violations of this act are not uncommon, but criminal prosecutions for violations are uncommon. Usually the government requests a proper filing and issues a fine. Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, says there’s “not much there” in the indictment.

The indictment was also interesting for some of the information contained in it. There’s Manafort’s lavish spending, alleged to be the vehicle by which the duo laundered gobs of cash back to the United States. The indictment also mentions problematic behavior with “Company A” and “Company B,” reported to be the Podesta Group and Mercury Public Affairs. Both of these groups admitted in 2017 to doing work on behalf of Manafort’s Ukraine front group, work they’d been doing since 2012.

On Monday, Tony Podesta of the Podesta Group announced he was departing the lobbying firm he founded. Podesta Group had lobbied on behalf of Uranium One, the group at the center of questions about a bribery attempt during the previous administration. Podesta is the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, and a longtime Democratic operative.

4. Are The Indictments Related To 2016 Election Collusion With Russia?

No. The indictment is for money laundering and failing to disclose and file proper paperwork. Nothing in the indictment mentions Russia, or collusion with Russia, and nothing mentions Donald Trump. The indictment shows that Mueller has moved afield from investigating Russian election meddling and collusion with Russia, although the tangential ties to the campaign and Russia may keep observers from getting too upset with him.

5. What About George Papadopolous?

Perhaps because the Manafort/Gates indictment was unrelated to the campaign or Trump, reporters quickly turned their attention to the more surprising news that Trump policy advisor George Papadopolous had not just pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators, but had become what’s called a “proactive cooperator” with investigators. That means he may have been used to try to lure other Trump affiliates into false testimony or obstructions of justice.

The guilty plea was related to a single count of Papadopolous telling investigators false things about the timing of his discussions with Russian-connected contacts. Trump defenders say that he was an insignificant volunteer with no access to Trump while Trump critics are saying this is evidence of the Trump campaign’s intent to collude.

Former federal prosecutor McCarthy says the evidence in the plea document is exculpatory for Trump. Papadopolous was told, apparently falsely, that Russians had acquired thousands of Clinton emails. He was presumably willing to receive these emails. But if Russia had to inform a low-level campaign figure of this fact so the campaign could learn about it, that would mean they had nothing to do with the acquisition of the emails. And there is no evidence the claim was true to begin with.

While the guilty plea isn’t in and of itself bad for Trump, Papadopolous’ work as a proactive cooperator may yield additional results.

6. What’s Next?

Since Manafort was always assumed to be the big target of Mueller’s probe, today’s indictment could indicate that the investigation is wrapping up. But it’s not unreasonable to wonder if other Trump affiliates will be caught up in false statement charges or money laundering charges. Or perhaps family members or affiliates of Manafort and Gates can expect charges. Company A and Company B might also face the wrath of a special prosecutor who has found evidence of failure to properly file foreign agent paperwork.

If Mueller is serious about rooting out undisclosed lobbying work for foreign governments as well as looking at Russia’s influence in the election, the stated reason for his probe, he’ll be digging more into Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to run the Russia-Trump dossier operation. The group has been accused of doing unregistered lobbying work on behalf of Russians.

And let’s not forget Mike Flynn, Trump’s former national security advisor who was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for unregistered lobbying on behalf of Turkey during the campaign.

7. Trump Is Guilty Of Bad Judgment

It was Trump’s decision to hire Manafort, a known character, and place him at the head of his campaign. Ditto for Flynn’s role. Manafort may have been instrumental in helping Trump secure the Republican nomination, but his indictment on money laundering is not exactly an earth-shattering surprise.

Having affiliates who behave in such ways as to get in trouble with special prosecutors is not the same thing as traitorous collusion with Russia to steal an election that Hillary Clinton was supposed to win. But while Trump has many people in his cabinet and team who have good reputations, he has not always shown good judgment with those close to him.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/31/7-takeaways-from-muellers-charges-in-russia-collusion-probe/,2017-10-31
Why The Media Stopped Reporting The Russia Collusion Story,"Half the country wants to know why the press won’t cover the growing scandal now implicating the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice, and threatening to reach the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency, and perhaps even the Obama White House.

After all, the release last week of a less-redacted version of Sens. Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham’s January 4 letter showed that the FBI secured a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to search the communications of a Trump campaign adviser based on a piece of opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The Fourth Amendment rights of an American citizen were violated to allow one political party to spy on another.

If the press did its job and reported the facts, the argument goes, then it wouldn’t just be Republicans and Trump supporters demanding accountability and justice. Americans across the political spectrum would understand the nature and extent of the abuses and crimes touching not just on one political party and its presidential candidate but the rights of every American.

That’s all true, but irrelevant. The reasons the press won’t cover the story are suggested in the Graham-Grassley letter itself.

Steele Was a Media Informant

The letter details how Christopher Steele, the former British spy who allegedly authored the documents claiming ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, told the FBI he wasn’t talking to the press about his investigation. In a British court, however, Steele acknowledged briefing several media organizations on the material in his dossier.

According to the British court documents, Steele briefed the New York Times, Washington Post, Yahoo! News, The New Yorker, and CNN. In October, he talked to Mother Jones reporter David Corn by Skype. It was Corn’s October 31 article anonymously sourced to Steele that alerted the FBI their informant was speaking to the press. Grassley and Graham referred Steele to the Department of Justice for a criminal investigation because he lied to the FBI.

The list of media outfits and journalists made aware of Steele’s investigations is extensive. Reuters reported that it, too, was briefed on the dossier, and while it refrained from reporting on it before the election, its national security reporter Mark Hosenball became an advocate of the dossier’s findings after November 2016.

BBC’s Paul Wood wrote in January 2017 that he was briefed on the dossier a week before the election. Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald likely saw Steele’s work around the same time, because he published an article days before the election based on a “Western intelligence” source (i.e., Steele) who cited names and data points that could only come from the DNC- and Clinton-funded opposition research.

A line from the Grassley-Graham letter points to an even larger circle of media outfits that appear to have been in contact with either Steele or Fusion GPS, the Washington DC firm that contracted him for the opposition research the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee commissioned. “During the summer of 2016,” the Grassley-Graham letter reads, “reports of some of the dossier allegations began circulating among reporters and people involved in Russian issues.”

Planting the Carter Page Story

Indeed, it looks like Steele and Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson may have persuaded a number of major foreign policy and national security writers in Washington and New York that Trump and his team were in league with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Those journalists include New Yorker editor David Remnick, Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, former New Republic editor Franklin Foer, and Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum.

A Foer story published in Slate on July 4, 2016 appears to be central. Titled “Putin’s Puppet,” Foer’s piece argues the Trump campaign was overly Russia-friendly. Foer discusses Trump’s team, including campaign convention manager Paul Manafort, who worked with former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovich, a Putin ally; and Carter Page, who, Foer wrote, “advised the state-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom and helped it attract Western investors.”

That’s how Page described himself in a March 2016 Bloomberg interview. But as Julia Ioffe reported in a September 23, 2016 Politico article, Page was a mid-level executive at Merrill Lynch in Moscow who played no role in any of the big deals he boasted about. As Ioffe shows, almost no one in Moscow remembered Page. Until Trump read his name off a piece of paper handed to him during a March interview with the Washington Post, almost no one in the Washington foreign policy world had heard of Page either.

So what got Foer interested in Page? Were Steele and Simpson already briefing reporters on their opposition research into the Trump campaign? (Another Foer story for Slate, an October 31, 2016 article about the Trump organization’s computer servers “pinging” a Russian bank, was reportedly “pushed” to him by Fusion GPS.) Page and Manafort are the protagonists of the Steele dossier, the former one of the latter’s intermediaries with Russian officials and associates of Putin. Page’s July 7 speech in Moscow attracted wide U.S. media coverage, but Foer’s article published several days earlier.

The Slate article, then, looks like the predicate for allegations against Page made in the dossier after his July Russia trip. For instance, according to Steele’s investigations, Page was offered a 19 percent stake in Rosneft, one of the world’s energy giants, in exchange for help repealing sanctions related to Russia’s 2014 incursion into Ukraine.

Building an Echo Chamber of Opposition Research

Many have noted the absurdity that the FISA warrant on Page was chiefly based, according to a House intelligence committee memo, on the dossier and Michael Isikoff’s September 23, 2016 news story also based on the dossier. But much of the Russiagate campaign was conducted in this circular manner. Steele and Simpson built an echo chamber with their opposition research, parts of the law enforcement and intelligence communities, and the press all reinforcing one another. Plant an item in the open air and watch it grow—like Page’s role in the Trump campaign.

Why else was Foer or anyone so interested in Page? Why was Page’s Moscow speech so closely watched and widely covered? According to the Washington Post, Page “chided” American policymakers for an “often-hypocritical focus on democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” in its dealings with Russia, China, and Central Asia.

As peculiar as it may have sounded for a graduate of the Naval Academy to cast a skeptical eye on American exceptionalism, Page’s speech could hardly have struck the policy establishment as shocking, or even novel. They’d been hearing versions of it for the last eight years from the president of the United States.

In President Obama’s first speech before the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on September 23, 2009, he insisted that no country, least of all America, has the right to tell other countries how to organize their political lives. “Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside,” said Obama. “Each society must search for its own path, and no path is perfect. Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions.”

Obama sounded even more wary of American leadership on his way out of office eight years later. In his 2016 UNGA speech, the 2009 Nobel laureate said: “I do not think that America can — or should — impose our system of government on other countries.” Obama was addressing not just foreign nations but perhaps more pointedly his domestic political rivals.

In 2008 Obama campaigned against the Iraq War and the Republican policymakers who toppled Saddam Hussein to remake Iraq as a democracy. All during his presidency, Obama rebuffed critics who petitioned the administration to send arms or troops to advance U.S. interests and values abroad, most notably in Ukraine and Syria.

In 2016, it was Trump who ran against the Republican foreign policy establishment—which is why hundreds of GOP policymakers and foreign policy intellectuals signed two letters distancing themselves from the party’s candidate. The thin Republican bench of foreign policy experts available to Trump is a big reason why he named the virtually unknown Page to his team. So why was it any surprise that Page sounded like the Republican candidate, who sounded like the Democratic president?

Why Didn’t the Left Like Obama’s Ideas from a Republican?

On the Right, many national security and foreign policy writers like me heard and were worried by the clear echoes of Obama’s policies in the Trump campaign’s proposals. Did those writing from the left side of the political spectrum not see the continuities?

Writing in the Washington Post July 21, 2016, Applebaum explained how a “Trump presidency could destabilize Europe.” The issue, she explained, was Trump’s positive attitude toward Putin. “The extent of the Trump-Russia business connection has already been laid out, by Franklin Foer at Slate,” wrote Applebaum. She named Page and his “long-standing connections to Russian companies.”

Did Applebaum’s talking points come from Steele’s opposition research?

Even more suggestive to Applebaum is that just a few days before her article was published, “Trump’s campaign team helped alter the Republican party platform to remove support for Ukraine” from the Republican National Committee’s platform. Maybe, she hinted, that was because of Trump aide Manafort’s ties to Yanukovich.

Did those talking points come from Steele’s opposition research? Manafort’s relationship with Yanukovich had been widely reported in the U.S. press long before he signed on with the Trump campaign. In fact, in 2007 Glenn Simpson was one of the first to write about their shady dealings while he was still working at the Wall Street Journal. The corrupt nature of the Manafort-Yanukovich relationship is an important part of the dossier. So is the claim that in exchange for Russia releasing the DNC emails, “the TRUMP team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue.”

The reality, however, is that the Trump campaign team never removed support for Ukraine from the party platform. In a March 18, 2017 Washington Examiner article, Byron York interviewed the convention delegate who pushed for tougher language on Russia, and got it.

“In the end, the platform, already fairly strong on the Russia-Ukraine issue,” wrote York, “was strengthened, not weakened.” Maybe Applebaum just picked it up from her own paper’s mis-reporting.

For Applebaum, it was hard to understand why Trump would express skepticism about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, except to appease Putin. She referred to a recent interview in which Trump “cast doubt on the fundamental basis of transatlantic stability, NATO’s Article 5 guarantee: If Russia invades, he said, he’d have to think first before defending U.S. allies.”

The Echoes Pick Up

In an article published the very same day in the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg made many of the very same observations. Titled “It’s Official: Hillary Clinton is Running Against Vladimir Putin,” the article opens: “The Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, has chosen this week to unmask himself as a de facto agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin.” What was the evidence? Well, for one, Page’s business interests.

Trump’s expressed admiration for Putin and other “equivocating, mercenary statements,” wrote Goldberg, are “unprecedented in the history of Republican foreign policymaking.” However, insofar as Trump’s fundamental aim was to find some common ground with Putin, it’s a goal that, for better or worse, has been a 25-year U.S. policy constant, across party lines. Starting with George W.H. Bush, every American commander-in-chief since the end of the Cold War sought to “reset” relations with Russia.

Starting with George W.H. Bush, every American commander-in-chief since the end of the Cold War sought to ‘reset’ relations with Russia.

But Trump, according to Goldberg, was different. “Trump’s understanding of America’s role in the world aligns with Russia’s geostrategic interests.” Here Goldberg rang the same bells as Applebaum—the Trump campaign “watered down” the RNC’s platform on Ukraine; the GOP nominee “questioned whether the U.S., under his leadership, would keep its [NATO] commitments,” including Article 5. Thus, Goldberg concluded: “Donald Trump, should he be elected president, would bring an end to the postwar international order.”

That last bit sounds very bad. Coincidentally, it’s similar to a claim made in the very first paragraph of the Steele dossier — the “Russian regime,” claims one of Steele’s unnamed sources, has been cultivating Trump to “encourage splits and divisions in the western alliance.”

The West won the Cold War because the United States kept it unified. David Remnick saw it up close. Assigned to the Washington Post’s Moscow bureau in 1988, Remnick witnessed the end of the Soviet Union, which he documented in his award-winning book, “Lenin’s Tomb.” So it’s hardly surprising that in his August 3, 2016 New Yorker article, “Trump and Putin: A Love Story,” Remnick sounded alarms concerning the Republican presidential candidate’s manifest affection for the Russian president.

Citing the “original reporting” of Foer’s seminal Slate article, the New Yorker editor contended “that one reason for Trump’s attitude has to do with his business ambitions.” As Remnick elaborated, “one of Trump’s foreign-policy advisers, has longstanding ties to Gazprom, a pillar of Russia’s energy industry.” Who could that be? Right—Carter Page. With Applebaum and Goldberg, Remnick was worried about Trump’s lack of support for Ukraine and the fact that Trump “has declared NATO ‘obsolete’ and has suggested that he might do away with Article 5.”

Where Did All These Echoes Come From?

This brings us to the fundamental question: Is it possible that these top national security and foreign policy journalists were focused on something else during Obama’s two terms in office, something that had nothing to do with foreign policy or national security? It seems we must even entertain the possibility they slept for eight years because nearly everything that frightened them about the prospects of a Trump presidency had already transpired under Obama.

Whatever one thinks of Obama’s foreign policy, it is hardly arguable that he ceded American interests in Europe and the Middle East in an effort to avoid conflict with Russia.

The Trump team wanted to stop short of having the RNC platform promise lethal support to Ukraine—which was in keeping with official U.S. policy. Obama didn’t want to arm the Ukrainians. He ignored numerous congressional efforts to get him to change his mind. “There has been a strong bipartisan well of support for quite some time for providing lethal support,” said California Rep. Adam Schiff. But Obama refused.

As for the western alliance or international order or however you want to put it, it was under the Obama administration that Russia set up shop on NATO’s southern border. With the Syrian conflict, Moscow re-established its foothold in the Middle East after 40 years of American policy designed to keep it from meddling in U.S. spheres of influence. Under Obama, Russia’s enhanced regional position threatened three U.S. allies: Israel, Jordan, and NATO member Turkey.

In 2012, Moscow’s Syrian client brought down a Turkish air force reconnaissance plane. According to a 2013 Wall Street Journal article, “Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised alarms in the U.S. by suggesting that Turkey might invoke NATO’s Article V.” However, according to the Journal, “neither the U.S. nor NATO was interested in rushing to Article V… NATO was so wary of getting pulled into Syria that top alliance officials balked at even contingency planning for an intervention force to protect Syrian civilians. ‘For better or worse, [Syrian president Bashar al- Assad] feels he can count on NATO not to intervene right now,’ a senior Western official said.”

Whatever one thinks of Obama’s foreign policy, it is hardly arguable that he—wisely, cautiously, in the most educated and creative ways, or unwisely, stupidly, cravenly, the choice of adjectives is yours—ceded American interests and those of key allies in Europe and the Middle East in an effort to avoid conflict with Russia.

When Russia occupied Crimea and the eastern portion of Ukraine, there was little pushback from the White House. The Obama administration blinked even when Putin’s escalation of forces in Syria sent millions more refugees fleeing abroad, including Europe.

Was Anyone Paying Attention When This Happened?

Surely it couldn’t have escaped Applebaum’s notice that Obama’s posture toward Russia made Europe vulnerable. She’s a specialist in Europe and Russia—she’s written books on both. Her husband is the former foreign minister of Poland. So how, after eight years of Obama’s appeasement of a Russia that threatened to withhold natural gas supplies from the continent, did the Trump team pose a unique threat to European stability?

Is it possible that Goldberg never bothered to research the foreign policy priorities of a president he interviewed five times between 2008 and 2016?

What about Goldberg? Is it possible that he’d never bothered to research the foreign policy priorities of a president he interviewed five times between 2008 and 2016? In the last interview, from March 2016, Obama told him he was “very proud” of the moment in 2013 when he declined to attack Assad for deploying chemical weapons. As Obama put it, that’s when he broke with the “Washington playbook.” He chose diplomacy instead. He made a deal with Russia over Assad’s conventional arsenal—which Syria continued to use against civilians throughout Obama’s term.

Again, regardless of how you feel about Obama’s decisions, the fact is that he struck an agreement with Moscow that ensured the continued reign of its Syrian ally, who gassed little children. Yet only four months later, Goldberg worried that a Trump presidency would “liberate dictators, first and foremost his ally Vladimir Putin, to advance their own interests.”

Remnick wrote a 2010 biography of Obama, but did he, too, pay no attention to the policies of the man he interviewed frequently over nearly a decade? How is this possible? Did some of America’s top journalists really sleepwalk through Obama’s two terms in office, only to wake in 2016 and find Donald Trump and his campaign becoming dangerously cozy with a historical American adversary?

All’s Fair in War and Politics

Of course not. They enlisted their bylines in a political campaign on behalf of the Democratic candidate for president and rehearsed the talking points Steele later documented. But weren’t the authors of these articles, big-name journalists, embarrassed to be seen reading from a single script and publishing the same article with similar titles within the space of two weeks? Weren’t they worried it would look like they were taking opposition research, from the same source?

The stories were vessels built only to launch thousands of 140-character salvos to then sink into the memory hole.

No, not really. In a sense, these stories weren’t actually meant to be read. They existed for the purpose of validating the ensuing social media messaging. The stories were written around the headlines, which were written for Twitter: “Putin’s Puppet”; “It’s Official: Hillary Clinton is Running Against Vladimir Putin”; “Trump and Putin: A Love Story”; “The Kremlin’s Candidate.” The stories were vessels built only to launch thousands of 140-character salvos to then sink into the memory hole.

Since everyone took Clinton’s victory for granted, journalists assumed extravagant claims alleging an American presidential candidate’s illicit ties to an adversarial power would fade just as the fireworks punctuating Hillary’s acceptance speech would vanish in the cool November evening. And the sooner the stories were forgotten the better, since they frankly sounded kooky, conspiratorial, as if the heirs to the Algonquin round table sported tin-foil hats while tossing back martinis and trading saucy limericks.

Yes, the Trump-Russia collusion media campaign really was delusional and deranged; it really was a conspiracy theory. So after the unexpected happened, after Trump won the election, the Russiagate campaign morphed into something more urgent, something twisted and delirious.

Quick, Pin Our Garbage Story on Someone

When CNN broke the story—co-written by Evan Perez, a former colleague and friend of Fusion GPS principals—that the Obama administration’s intelligence chiefs had briefed Trump on the existence of the dossier, it not only cleared the way for BuzzFeed to publish the document, it also signaled the press that the intelligence community was on side. This completed the echo chamber, binding one American institution chartered to steal and keep secrets to another embodying our right to free speech. We know which ethic prevailed.

Now Russiagate was no longer part of a political campaign directed at Trump, it was a disinformation operation pointed at the American public.

Now Russiagate was no longer part of a political campaign directed at Trump, it was a disinformation operation pointed at the American public, as the pre-election media offensive resonated more fully with the dossier now in the open. You see, said the press: everything we published about Trump and Putin is really true—there’s a document proving it. What the press corps neglected to add is that they’d been reporting talking points from the same opposition research since before the election, and were now showcasing “evidence” to prove it was all true.

The reason the media will not report on the scandal now unfolding before the country, how the Obama administration and Clinton campaign used the resources of the federal government to spy on the party out of power, is not because the press is partisan. No, it is because the press has played an active role in the Trump-Russia collusion story since its inception. It helped birth it.

To report how the dossier was made and marketed, and how it was used to violate the privacy rights of an American citizen—Page—would require admitting complicity in manufacturing Russiagate. Against conventional Washington wisdom, the cover-up in this case is not worse than the crime: Both weigh equally in a scandal signaling that the institution where American citizens are supposed to discuss and debate the choices about how we live with each other has been turned against a large part of the public to delegitimize their political choices.

This Isn’t the 27-Year-Olds’ Fault

I’ve argued over the last year that the phony collusion narrative is a symptom of the structural problems with the press. The rise of the Internet, then social media, and gross corporate mismanagement damaged traditional media institutions. As newspapers and magazines around the country went bankrupt when ownership couldn’t figure out how to make money off the new digital advertising model, an entire generation of journalistic experience, expertise, and ethics was lost. It was replaced, as one Obama White House official famously explained, by 27-year-olds who “literally know nothing.”

But the first vehicles of the Russiagate campaign were not bloggers or recent J-school grads lacking wisdom or guidance to wave off a piece of patent nonsense. They were journalists at the top of their profession—editors-in-chief, columnists, specialists in precisely the subjects that the dossier alleges to treat: foreign policy and national security. They didn’t get fooled. They volunteered their reputations to perpetrate a hoax on the American public.

That’s why, after a year of thousands of furious allegations, all of which concerning Trump are unsubstantiated, the press will not report the real scandal, in which it plays a leading role. When the reckoning comes, Russiagate is likely to be seen not as a symptom of the collapse of the American press, but as one of the causes for it.

Ukraine’s Puppet Church Prefigures Francis’s Capitulation To China,"Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime is not the first to employ a puppet church to absorb, and finally dissolve, the genuine one. In the Ukraine of the 1920s, the so-called Living Church prefigured the Catholic Patriotic Association, a creature of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) in the 1950s. It is to this counter-church that Pope Francis bows, in effect making the Catholic Church in China a client of the CPC.

Unlike China’s Patriotic Association, the Living Church was not created by the government. It began as part of a broader reform movement—Renovationism—within the Russian Orthodox Church. Relations between the Orthodox Church and the Bolsheviks were multifaceted and tangled. The Living Church, formed in 1922, began in tension between ecclesiastical reform and issues of loyalty to Soviet aims.

Of relevance here is that the Living Church, with Soviet support, evolved rapidly into a tool of the State Political Police (GPU). It functioned within the orbit of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), an intelligence agency charged with suppressing “counter-revolutionary activity.” In similar fashion, China’s Catholic Patriotic Association is answerable, ultimately, to the Central Committee of the CPC as its sole governing authority. The CPC’s surveillance, confiscatory, and punitive powers hang over the Patriotic Association like the sword of Damocles.

The Ultimate Goal Was Eliminating Faith Entirely

Traditional religious faith—“dross of the old society”—was necessarily as anathema to the Bolsheviks as it is to the CPC. The religion most under assault in the Ukraine was Christianity. In the judgment of both regimes, a substitute for the church, whether Orthodox or Roman Catholic, would gradually eliminate Christianity by attrition.

Atheistic Communism presumed that all religion would wither as ideological propaganda eroded the class conditions thought to produce it. Soviets had a word for the process: samotek. Xi’s analogous strategy is sinocization. In a 2015 meeting with the United Front, Xi repeated old Maoist warnings against ideological pollution from the West. Contamination resides in Christianity, seen as a Western religion.

In the Ukraine, a gradualist approach was meant to reconcile the Living Church and the patriarchal one by degrees. It was believed that Orthodox faithful would slowly, imperceptibly, accept the quisling leadership of the Living Church.

Moreover, indirection avoided alienating potential sympathizers, especially those abroad. Philip Walters, an authority in Soviet religious policy, explained: “The aim was now a form of hidden schism; the infiltration of Trojan horses within that church to which the believing population had demonstrated its continuing allegiance.”

No Private Worship, Only State-Controlled Worship

Despite intimidation, the mass of believers remained stubbornly loyal to Orthodoxy. It was the schismatic church that dwindled instead, whereupon the Soviets heightened attacks on the church, especially in the countryside against the peasantry. Offensives culminated in the rural terror of 1930-33.

Mao Zedong, repeating Soviet tactics, employed calculated schism with longer patience and better luck than the Stalinists. The church in China has been in de facto schism since the imposition of the Patriotic Association. In exchange for surrendering to the CPC’s separatist creation, Pope Francis receives the fig leaf of an illusory hold on authority no firmer than the pious boilerplate of Vatican diplomats.

Even before holy water had dried on moves toward appeasement, China’s State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) tightened strictures on the underground (canonically legitimate) church. Asia News, an online publication of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions, follows realities on the ground. Editor Bernardo Cervellera writes of “a new Cultural Revolution”:

Just like then, it is forbidden for believers to pray even in private, in their homes. The police threaten that if they find two people praying together in their home, they will be arrested and forced to undergo re-education. Under the new regulations on religious activities, proposed last September and implemented last February 1st, worship can only be carried out in church, at the times set by the government. Any other place is considered an ‘illegal place’ and those who break such regulations will be subject to prison, fines, expropriation of the building that houses illegal religious activity. Even private homes are now considered an ‘illegal place of worship’: in every private house religious conversation or prayer is forbidden, under threat of arrest. The faithful can pray only in [a Party-approved] church, during Sunday service. All churches must display a sign at their entrance announcing that the building is ‘forbidden to minors under the age of 18’ must be exposed because children and young people are prohibited from participating in religious rites.

Christians are barred from government positions. Religious beliefs of any kind are forbidden to Communist Party members. To be considered “under the law,” all religions must be directed by the government. County and village authorities have the right to intervene in religious activities. Cameras have been placed at all religious sites and celebrations are subject to police checks. Denunciation, facilitated by smartphone photos, is encouraged.

Communism Isn’t So Bad, Right?

Even before the regulations became the norm on February 1, police and representatives of the Religious Affairs Bureau have been “advising” priests and lay faithful from underground communities to register. Registration with the bureau automatically implies membership in the Patriotic Association. Nevertheless, behind the Vatican wall, anti-Communism remains yesterday’s phobia, a Cold War relic unsuited to global cooperation.

To some extent, Pope Francis is simply accelerating a genuflection to the world begun by Pope John XXIII. John convened the Second Vatican Council in the very year that marked the end of Mao’s Great Leap Forward (1958-62), the deadliest reign of mass murder in recorded history.

Yet Pacem in Terris (1963) brought a manic naiveté to John XXIII’s effort to come to terms with communism and socialism. It took issue with the belief that Marxism is inherently antithetical to Christianity. While the pope named Marxism “a false philosophy,” he believed its precepts have been misinterpreted. Although things can get out of hand in practice, Communism might well hold “good and commendable elements.”

Vatican II had been convened 30 years before Soviet bloc archives were opened. The crimes—terror, deliberate famine, mass deportations, and executions—of a Marxist-Leninist state were as yet not widely known. So perhaps an excuse can be made for John XXIII’s apparent ignorance of the brutal Ukrainian genocide, the Holodomor, that took at least 11 million lives (a conservative estimate, according to historian Robert Conquest). Still, papal credence in the beneficent potential of communist systems concurrent with Mao’s atrocities is difficult to fathom.

The ‘Vivacity, Joy, Serenity’ of Totalitarianism

John XXIII was not alone. In the era of Pacem in Terris, the Great Helmsman’s prestige was strong in the West. His “Little Red Book” was second only to the Bible in global circulation. A hundred flowers bloomed in the minds of Western intellectuals, confirming Stalin’s old confidence in the gullibility of the West.

The exalted view of Mao’s achievement by two influential Italian Catholics, who traveled to China at the height of the blood-soaked Cultural Revolution, was not untypical. Gianpaolo Meucci, a Florentine jurist, and Raniero La Valle, a distinguished chronicler of Vatican II, memorialized their 1973 visit with this:

Chinese society is full of vivacity, joy, serenity. During a month-long stay in China there has never been even the most fleeting impression of the existence of a domineering police power. Even the guards at the government building, who try in every way to give themselves a martial air, appear almost ridiculous when compared with their counterparts in the West, such that in comparison with them our rookie soldiers guarding the barracks or monuments look like Nazis.

The piles of corpses did not enter their memoir.

In “Harvest of Sorrow,” Conquest emphasized what is commonly overlooked in popular treatments of the man-made famine that reduced the Ukraine to “a vast Belsen”: The so-called kulaks, designated a class enemy, were predominantly Orthodox. Dekulakization doubled as a means of dechristianization. Conquest wrote:

A major concerted assault on the churches began in late 1929, and came to a climax in the first three months of 1930. . . .Dekulakization was the occasion for attacks on the church and the individual priest. A party view was that ‘The church is the kulak’s agitprop.’ . . . Collectivization usually involved the closure of the local church as well. Icons were confiscated as a matter of routine and burned along with other objects of religious worship. . . . Bell seizure and church closure went hand in hand.

Similarly, Xi’s sinocization is functional dechristianization. It takes a cue from Lenin, whose famous letter to Maxim Gorki referred to the idea of God as “contagion of the most abominable kind.” With all clergy subject to orders from the CPC, the church will be reduced to promoting the regime’s political and economic agendas. It will be crippled in making the truth claims that distinguish it from Meals on Wheels or any other social service organization.

Unlike John XXIII, Pope Francis cannot be thought innocent of the full spectrum of communism’s monstrous means toward material ends. But he has set about annihilating distinction between secular and spiritual ends, an erasure apparent in his gospel-coated embrace of environmentalism and the tropes of climate change.

In their forward to “The Black Book of Communism” (1999), the authors write that in the contemporary age “morality is not primarily a matter of eternal verities or transcendental imperatives. It is above all a matter of political allegiances. That is, it is a matter of left versus right . . . .”

The mission of the Christian church is not political. And diplomacy has value only insofar as it facilitates the church’s mission. But Francis, a man of his time and of the Left, has made politics into an idol. To every idol sacrifice must be offered. The Chinese faithful are first on the pyre.

"Liberals Are Wrong To Count On Sanity Of Kim Jong Un, Putin Over Trump","“The View” host Joy Behar recently drew a moral equivalence between President Donald Trump, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. She went as far as proclaim the world has to rely on “the sanity of Kim Jong Un and [Vladimir] Putin over the president of the United States.”

When Meghan McCain, the only conservative co-host on the talk show, said it’s dangerous to suggest there’s a moral equivalence between Trump and dictators responsible for genocide, Behar doubled down. “What, you think Kim Jong Un is less moral than Trump?” she asked. “Do you?”

A shocked McCain immediately replied, “Oh, my God. I think Putin’s aiding and abetting Assad right now. Chemical gassing of children — last time I checked, America isn’t doing that to anyone.”

Viewers of “The View” should be glad that McCain is available to bring some reason and logic to Behar’s utterly wrong argument. Most Americans, including many who voted for Trump, acknowledge that Trump is a deeply flawed individual. Yes, he is known for his infidelity, just like Bill Clinton. We all heard his past derogatory comments degrading women. Yes, he sometimes is vain and ruthless. But it is a fallacy to suggest there is no moral difference between Trump’s personal misdeeds and authoritarian dictators who commit major atrocities.

For the sake of the argument, let’s do a side by side comparison of Putin, Kim and Trump.

Putin won his third presidential term virtually unopposed by either jailing or assassinating his critics; by having total control over state media and the election committee, which counts the votes and decides who makes it onto the ballot. Unlike Putin, Trump rose to power by competing fairly and squarely, first against 15 experienced Republican politicians for party nomination and then running against Hillary Clinton, who had raised more campaign funds and was supported by well-oiled political organizations.

From his candidacy until now in his presidency, Trump has faced a largely liberal media who are hostile to him and criticize everything he says and does on a daily basis. None of his critics lost their jobs or lives under Trump’s order. He hasn’t even fired Robert Muller, who is in charge of finding Trump campaign collusion with Russia and who did a Ken Starr by raiding Trump’s personal lawyer’s office looking for evidence of cover up for an extramarital affair.

Putin is also known for either instigating unrests or extending chaos around the world. He annexed Crimea from Ukraine, a sovereign nation. Under his leadership, the Russian government provided missiles to Russia-supported rebels in Ukraine, who used one to shoot down Malaysia Airline flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board.

Russia was supposed to help Syria destroy chemical weapons, yet as Megan McCain points out, it’s Russia’s aid to Assad that not only provides a lifeline to the Assad regime, but also enables the Assad regime to use chemical weapons against its own people, including children. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Putin has blood on his hands. Unlike most European Union leaders, Trump is openly calling out both Russia and Assad for their despicable act and is actively planning on doing something to prevent it from happening again.

What about Kim Jong Un? Is he more moral or does he have more sanity than Trump, in Behar’s words? We can find the answer in a 374-page report released by the UN in 2015, detailing the “unspeakable” scale of human suffering inside North Korea and the vast state apparatus the regime uses to control its people. Here are a few key findings:

People were either sent to labor camps to work themselves to death or were executed in school grounds, marketplaces and on river banks for pitiful crimes that include distributing South Korean media and stealing copper. Their bodies were burned and ashes were used as fertilizer.

Children are forced into weekly “confession and criticism” sessions as part of their indoctrination: Children are taught to draw either pictures of the Dear Leader or of stabbing U.S. and Japanese soldiers.

Every home is fitted with a speaker through which North Korean propaganda can be blared.

Violence against women is not limited to the home, and it is common to see women being beaten and sexually assaulted in public.

The North Korean regime is estimated to have kidnapped 200,000 foreigners since 1950, including women abducted so they could be taken as wives.

Given that Kim Jong Un executed his uncle in cold blood and assassinated his own half brother abroad, no one should be surprised by the suffering he put his people through. Just like Putin, Kim Jong Un has blood on his hands too. A good question for Joy Behar, then, is which of Kim Jong Un’s deeds prove he’s morally superior to Trump?

The truth is Behar’s comments betrayed her own historical ignorance and delusion. She is fortunate to live in a free country where she can freely express her thoughts without fear. Had she lived in Russia or North Korea and made similar comments about either Putin or Kim Jong-un, she probably would have been pulled off air immediately and would have to spend the rest of her life languishing in a jail or labor camp.

Unfortunately, Behar is not the first liberal, and she won’t be the last liberal, who fails to see the moral difference between a ruthless dictator and a fellow American whose personal deeds, ideology or policies they disagree with, or make a moral equivalency between a totalitarian regime and a free country. Thus, liberals tell us, Trump is no better than Kim Jong Un; people who support the 2nd Amendment are not different from those who committed mass murders; Israel, the only democracy in the Mideast, is no better than the terrorist group Hamas.

By making such morally relativist statements, liberals in the U.S. are doing four things.

They demonstrate their own ignorance and give people reason not to take them seriously. They show disrespect to fellow Americans who have a different political ideology. They insult millions of people like me who either suffered through or have family members who suffered through true atrocities. They contribute to the rise of Trump.

Liberals don’t want to admit this: as much as they hate Trump and Trump supporters, the liberals have themselves to blame for Trump’s rise to power. Republicans used to choose good and decent people to represent them, like Bush 41 and Bush 43, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. These are traditional gentlemen, who are faithful to their wives, who are deeply religious, who have long public service experience, who speak gently and kindly, who are thoughtful, and who are ready to compromise across the aisle for the good of the country. Liberals vilified everyone of them: Bush 43 was called a war monger; Mitt Romney was cast as a coldhearted 1 percenter who cares more about making money than ordinary people’s lives; Paul Ryan was depicted as the guy who pushed a grandma off the cliff through welfare reform.

After destroying the reputations of these decent people, now liberals find themselves face to face with Trump, someone who will go lower if you go low and who will punch you back three times harder if you punch him. As the saying goes,” be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.” In Trump, liberals like Behar get exactly what they deserve.

11 Key Points From The Explosive Manafort Hearing The Media Missed,"Choice quotes from Judge T.S. Ellis have dominated the news cycle since Friday, when the lively 77-year-old Ronald Reagan appointee put the screws to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team in a Russia investigation hearing on Paul Manafort’s motion to dismiss the criminal charges brought against him. But the spattering of isolated quotes fail to fully capture the deficiencies Ellis exposed in Mueller’s handling of the case.

A full read of the nearly 50 pages of transcript from the hour-plus long hearing bares eleven facts worth noting beyond their entertainment value.

Let’s take a look.

1. Everything Old Is New Again

Ellis struck immediately in the hearing, demanding Mueller’s lead attorney, Michael Dreeben, explain how the pending charges against Manafort, which consisted of multiple counts of tax evasion, bank fraud, and failing to report foreign bank accounts stemming from decades old conduct, could possibly fall within the scope of Mueller’s authority to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 Presidential Election.

Here’s the set-up:

And the pitch:

But Dreeben leaned in, claiming “our investigatory scope does cover the activities that led to the indictment in this case.”

Unpersuaded, Ellis retorted: “It covers bank fraud in 2005 and 2007?”

2. Lies, Damn Lies, And The Special Counsel Appointment

Dreeben responded by turning to Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s May 17, 2017, appointment order. That order, which Ellis noted “I have it right in front of me,” provided:

Relying first on subsection (i), Dreeben argued, albeit with little success as the next exchange shows, that Manafort’s association with the Trump campaign placed the criminal charges within the Special Counsel’s authority.

After some more back-and-forths (more on that later), and reading his audience, Dreeben changed gears, pointing to an Aug. 2 memorandum Rosenstein issued to Mueller’s office:

Relying on the second bullet, Dreeben argued the charges against Manafort were within Mueller’s authority, as seen here:

At that point in the hearing, Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing, took to the podium to rebut Mueller’s argument. Downing hit many points, but most forcibly stressed the complete absence of authority in the May 17 appointment order for Mueller to charge Manafort with the tax evasion, mail fraud, and other counts currently pending before the Virginia federal district court.

Dreeben countered Downing’s claim in the following exchange, arguing the May 17 order didn’t need to publicly state Mueller’s authority:

It was in response to this argument that Ellis stung Mueller’s team with one of his more colorful commentaries — and a more biting characterization of the Mueller argument as, “We weren’t really telling the truth in that May 17 letter.”

And yet Dreeben persisted, arguing Congress did not require the Attorney General (or acting Attorney General) to publicly define Mueller’s authority in the May appointment order.

3. Ukraine Ain’t Russia … Yet.

Ellis also challenged the Special Counsel’s office on its contention that the Aug. 2 letter provided Mueller’s team the authority to investigate Manafort’s alleged crimes. That letter purported to clarify that Mueller’s jurisdiction included investigating “crimes arising out of payments [Manafort] received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.” But the May 17 appointment order spoke only of Russian-affiliated connections, and the indictment against Manafort identified only crimes related to his Ukrainian work.

This led Ellis on another tour down memory lane, to the time he visited the Ukraine in his youth. He noted the locals believed there was a huge difference between Ukraine and Russia.

Dreeben handled this exchange much better, explaining that Manafort had both Ukraine and Russia connections — and that the Ukrainian president whose government paid Manafort was Russian-backed.

4. How Exactly Did The Charges “Arise” Out Of The Mueller Investigation?

Dreeben floundered, however, when Ellis confronted him with the slight-of-hand Mueller’s team sought to advance by claiming the charges against Manafort “arose out of” the Mueller’s investigation.

Here’s how Ellis put it:

In response to the court’s questioning, Dreeben had no choice but to admit that the Special Counsel’s office “inherited” the preexisting investigation into Manafort from other U.S. Attorney’s offices — something, Manafort’s attorneys, in rebuttal, stressed Mueller’s office had never previously admitted.

5. He Might Sing Like A Canary — Or Compose His Own Score.

How exactly then did Manafort’s case end up with Mueller?

Ellis wanted to know:

And once Dreeben acknowledged the Special Counsel’s office inherited the “investigatory threads,” as he put it, Ellis knew the score — and tossed out his best line of the day — in this exchange.

He laid out Mueller’s real motive for charging Manafort:

Ellis reiterated this point several more times during the morning argument, much to Mueller’s chagrin (and Trump’s delight).

First here:

Then here, adding that the case against Manafort “has nothing whatever to do with” Mueller’s appointment:

And finally, the bit Trump seized upon during his speech to the National Rifle Association on Friday:

6. Why The Double Standard?

To bring home his point, Ellis also cornered Dreeben on Mueller’s seemingly incongruous treatment of Manafort and Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Mueller turned over the case against Cohen to the Eastern District of New York’s U.S. Attorney’s office, while retaining the equally unrelated-to-Russia case involving Manafort.

Why? To get Trump:

7. I’ve Got My Super-Duper Secret Decoder Ring

Ellis also called out the Special Counsel’s office for attempting to short-circuit his questioning by playing the “classified” card. The issue first arose when Dreeben referenced Rosenstein’s Aug. 2, 2017, memorandum that purportedly clarified Mueller’s authority.

Here’s Ellis asking why 75 percent of the document was blacked out:

And when Dreeben decided to play coy behind the “classified” label, Ellis decided to have a little fun with this exchange:

Dreeben, though, missed his cue, and again pushed the “classified” angle when trying to explain why Rosenstein’s May 17 appointment order was necessarily cryptic:

Ellis did a quick brush back to this argument, feigning surprise that Manafort’s case may need to proceed as a Classified Information Procedures Act (“CIPA”) case since the issue had never been raised before.

When called on his bluff, though, Dreeben backed away from the “classified” canard, as seen in this exchange:

8. It’s Not Law Law — It’s These Internal Things

Ellis also called out the Special Counsel’s office for positing that it wasn’t bound by the Department of Justice’s internal regulations governing Special Counsel appointments.

See below:

Ellis hammered this point again later:

9. Unfettered Power Is Un-American

Then, speaking for Americans who aren’t consumed with hatred for Trump, Ellis proclaimed:

He then asked how much of the $10 million allotted the Special Counsel had been spent, and when the investigation would end.

Dreeben, of course, was not at liberty to say, so Ellis merely put an exclamation point on the matter:

10. I Knew Archie Cox. And You’re A Lot Like Him.

After stressing “that the American people feel pretty strongly about no one having unfettered power,” Ellis recalled a judicial conference in the early ’90s on a special prosecutor.

“I think it was at the Greenbrier,” he said. “I was the chair of that judicial conference. It was a very interesting time. There were many special prosecutors who appeared, including my former constitutional law professor, Archie Cox, and others. So I had a wonderful opportunity to meet and speak to them and hear their variety of views.”

Dreeben interrupted Ellis’ reminiscence to “clarify one thing.”

“We are not operating with unfettered power,” Dreeben said. “We’re operating within a framework of regulations that contemplate regular reporting to the acting attorney general, who is supervising the work of our office within the framework.”

“This is not the Independent Counsel Act that Your Honor was referring to in the conference that you spoke of,” he added. “This is not a separate court-appointed prosecutor who’s operating under statutory independence. We are within the Department of Justice. We’re being supervised by an acting attorney general who has conferred upon us specific jurisdiction and who regularly is in a position to describe to us the metes and bounds of that.”

Ellis found this a difference without a distinction, noting that changes from the earlier-controlling independent counsel scheme to the special counsel paradigm were likely “not significant,” as this portion of the transcript highlights:

11. Who Invited Cinderella? Ellis Did.

Dreeben also attempted to refute the comparison to Independent Counsels of the past by stressing that Mueller’s team is but one branch of the big happy Department of Justice family. Oh, really, Ellis mentally intoned.

He reminded Dreeben that the Special Counsel’s office had balked when he had suggested bringing in local counsel, but then suddenly Uzo Asonye, from the Eastern District of Virginia, joined the trial team:

Apparently, that was one hint Mueller’s team did catch.

"Mueller Team’s Extra Powers Aren’t Abusive Yet, But Could Be","Last week, Politico and The Hill ran parallel stories highlighting that several attorneys on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team identified themselves as special assistant United States attorneys (SAUSA) in the criminal case pending against Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chair. Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel’s office, told Politico the SAUSA designation gave the attorneys “the same powers as a regular U.S. attorney.” SAUSA status allows a lawyer who is not a member of the local federal prosecutor’s office to act on behalf of the local U.S. attorney’s office.

From this fact, Politico’s Josh Gerstein reasoned that this “obscure special status . . . could prevent a judge from ousting Mueller’s lawyers from their role in the prosecution of” Manafort. The Hill concurred, suggesting SAUSA status would make it harder for Manafort to have the indictment tossed based on claims that Mueller’s team acted beyond the special counsel’s authority.

Yet Politico and The Hill misread the context of the special counsel’s use of the SAUSA designation. At this point, there is no evidence Mueller used attorneys with a dual status for inappropriate reasons, but the potential for abuse exists.

Let’s Start By Revisiting Where We Are

First, though, the necessary backdrop. Mueller charged Manafort in the Eastern District of Virginia with numerous counts of tax evasion, bank fraud, and failing to report foreign bank accounts. Manafort moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Mueller exceeded his authority as special counsel in charging Manafort with crimes unrelated to Russia’s interference with the 2016 presidential election.

Last month, Judge T.S. Ellis heard arguments on the motion and his direct questioning of the special counsel’s team and somewhat sympathetic ear to Manafort’s position dominated the news cycle for several days. Ellis questioned why the special counsel’s office was prosecuting Manafort for crimes that occurred years earlier and had nothing to do with the 2016 election. And why did the special counsel’s office maintain control over Manafort’s criminal case, while referring its separate case against President Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to the Manhattan-based U.S. attorney’s office?

Ellis also wanted to know the full scope of the special counsel’s authority, and ordered Mueller to file an unredacted copy of acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein’s August 2, 2017 memo that purported to clarify the authority granted Mueller in the May 2017 special counsel appointment. Mueller’s team complied with that directive last week. That led Sen. Charles Grassley to direct Rosenstein to provide the Senate Judiciary Committee—which he chairs—with the same information.

Against the backdrop of Ellis’ comments, Politico and The Hill read Mueller’s decision to obtain a joint designation of SAUSA for at least four of his attorneys (Andrew Weissmann, Greg Andres, Kyle Freeny, and Scott Meisler) as significant. It is not. Rather, the SAUSA designation allowed the special counsel’s office to comply with the local rules for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Those rules require “federal government attorneys representing the interests of the United States, including the United States Department of Justice,” to “secure local counsel by working with an assistant United States attorney [AUSA] assigned to the Eastern District of Virginia.” Mueller, however, wanted to keep tight control over the Russia investigation. So rather than work with a local AUSA, the special counsel apparently elected instead to obtain the SAUSA designation for his own lawyers, which is allowed. (Mueller later relented, though, telling Ellis “[w]e took your admonition to heart,” and thus arranged for a local AUSA to join them for the proceedings.)

In this context, then, Mueller’s use of the SAUSA designation proves nothing nefarious. It also has no effect on Manafort’s motion to dismiss. In that motion, Manafort argued Mueller acted beyond his special counsel authority and that any criminal case would thus need to be brought by the Eastern District of Virginia’s U.S. attorney’s office. The SAUSA designation did not affect this argument because the filings were still submitted on behalf of Robert S. Mueller III, as special counsel.

Further, in opposing Manafort’s motion to dismiss, Mueller’s office did not argue that the SAUSA status allowed the government to pursue charges outside the scope of the special counsel’s appointment. By not making that argument, the government waived any reliance on the SAUSA appointment as a basis for prosecution.

Mueller Doesn’t Need SAUSA Power to Prosecute Manafort

While the SAUSA appointment will not help the special counsel fend off Manafort’s motion to dismiss, Mueller doesn’t need to rely on the additional authority SAUSAs possess as a representative of the local U.S. attorney’s office because, as I explained last month, Manafort is destined to lose. That’s because Rosenstein granted “Mueller broad powers, including the authority to investigate ‘any links . . . between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.'”

“While Manafort’s time with the Trump team proved transient, his association with the presidential campaign, links with Russia, and work for the government of the Russian-backed Ukrainian president fell within the special counsel’s expansive reach.”

Since then, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over the special counsel’s second criminal case against Manafort in the D.C. District Court—where he is facing multiple counts of money-laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine—rejected an identical argument by Manafort’s legal team. Although Jackson’s decision does not bind Ellis, the same analysis will likely result in Ellis denying Manafort’s motion to dismiss the criminal charges pending in the Virginia district court.

But while Manafort is primed to lose on the merits of his motion to dismiss, Mueller is poised to lose in the court of public opinion. As I explained following the proceedings before Ellis, the cantankerous Ronald Reagan holdover brought media attention to several key facts: that the “charges against Manafort are unrelated to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election;” “that the government had long known of Manafort’s dealings with Ukraine but only decided to indict him after Mueller gained control of the investigation—to make him ‘sing,’”; and “that Rosenstein manipulated his statutory right to appoint a special counsel, something supposedly allowed only in limited circumstances.”

Now, thanks to The Hill and Politico’s reporting, we see that Mueller’s team members not only possess the virtually unlimited authority granted the special counsel’s office by Rosenstein, they also have the broader, general powers of SAUSA—should they ever decide to exercise that authority. Further, while there is no evidence at this time that the dual-designated attorneys are misusing their status to exceed the already broad reach of the special counsel’s investigation, Grassley should consider expanding the questions he posed to Rosenstein to assure that is the case—and remains the case.

Why No North Korea Summit May Be The Best Outcome Possible,"As the media spin changes from “legitimizing a despot” to “President Trump lost a historic chance of peace,” it is important to remember a fundamental reality of global politics. Sometimes, ambiguity and unpredictability is the best negotiating tactic.

President Trump’s summit cancellation letter to Kim Jong-Un subtly references nuclear deterrence working both ways, and that the optics favor the United States. Consider the ongoing scenario. American hostages who were jailed in North Korea are now back in the United States. Kim Jong-Un just publicly destroyed his nuclear testing tunnels. South Korean President Moon Jae-In is on record saying Trump should win a Nobel Prize for his willingness to bring peace to the peninsula. But Trump walked away from this the moment Kim threatened nuclear war.

China’s President Xi Jinping, who did a photo shoot looking like a poignant Greek philosopher lecturing Kim, the young Roman senator, now rests with the idea that he has essentially zero control over any of these proceedings. If foreign policy is all about optics, resonance to the domestic audience, and regime stability, as some international relations theory suggests, Kim, Xi, and Moon are toast.

‘Sticking to the Carcass of Dead Policies’

“The commonest error in politics,” Lord Salisbury said in 1877 regarding Britain’s foreign policy with Russia and Eastern Europe, “is sticking to the carcass of dead policies.” American foreign policy towards North Korea faced such a scenario. The stalemate of the last two decades was predicated on two simple scenarios: that China would liberalize politically, and in turn pressure North Korea to liberalize, and that the liberal international order would prevail.

As Francis Fukuyama found out, to his intense discomfort and a new book deal, both those assertions were flawed. China didn’t politically liberalize. Instead, China got the taste of being a great power and is now cozying up with the European Union to confront the United States. North Korea developed nuclear weapons. The much vaunted “liberal order,” which was never an “order” per se, but rather a form of hegemonic peace backed by American martial prowess, is increasingly looking fragile. American relative power is equilibrating with other rising and revanchist great powers, and imperial fatigue setting in.

In light of that, the summit with North Korea looked like a way out of the quagmire. It all started with Trump calling Kim a “little Rocket Man,” and Kim calling Trump a “Dotard” while shooting missiles in the Sea of Japan. There were reasons to celebrate, of course.

Kim’s overtures looked promising, but simplistic. The South Korean leader incidentally called for Trump to get a Nobel Peace Prize for bringing the North to the negotiation table. If Barack Obama can get a Nobel Prize for being elected as the first black president of the United States, Trump is at least definitely eligible if peace breaks out in the Korean peninsula.

It’s Very Rare for States to Give Up Power

However, there were reasons to be skeptical about Kim’s promises. Regardless of regime type, states don’t usually give up power on their own, especially power that assures their survival in their current form. The international system we inhabit is anarchical, and nation-states simply don’t trust bigger powers.

Consider the only two instances where a nation-state gave up its nuclear capabilities. Apartheid-era South Africa destroyed nuclear weapons and capabilities, so it didn’t fall into the hands of Marxist revolutionaries. The second was Ukraine, which for a short period of time was the third-largest nuclear power in the world (after the United States and Russia) immediately after the Soviet collapse. Ukraine gave it all up, with the explicit guarantee that Russia will never invade its neighbor and if it does, the United Kingdom and United States would provide deterrence.

Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Syria’s Bashar Assad also wanted nuclear weapons. Gaddafi gave up the pursuit voluntarily after 9/11, and allied himself with the West, hunting down Islamists. Assad’s facility was bombed by Israel. Consider how that worked out for Ukraine or Gaddafi. Assad would have met Gaddafi’s fate, too, if not for the Russian nuclear umbrella.

That is precisely the lesson Kim junior drew from these episodes. Contrary to popular wisdom, CIA research suggests Kim is extremely rational. He’s savage to his own people, but completely logical in foreign affairs. Any dictatorship is inherently built on a system of cronyism, where the primary motive for existence is, therefore, regime survival.

Yes, dictators do overreach sometimes. But those are either miscalculation about adversaries’ resolve or a false understanding of the balance of power. Neither is true for North Korea. In the eventuality of any war initiated by North Korea, Kim knows it will be his last act before he and his entire regime are obliterated. Kim’s intention is therefore to stall that scenario, to project a force that can impose an insufferable cost on South Korea, Japan, and even the United States.

The entire rationale for Kim to develop even crude forms of nuclear weapons is to declare that yes, the Kim regime might be destroyed in a war, but so will millions of South Koreans, Japanese, or Americans in Hawaii or California. Deterrence works both ways, and Kim had no intention of suffering Gaddafi’s fate. Kim cannot solely rely on China, like Assad relied on Russia, either. Geopolitics is unpredictable. If tomorrow China and the United States reach a grand bargain and G2 in Asia, Kim will be toast.

Kim Just Got Trumped

What is important is not to look like surrendering everything and getting nothing in return. By that logic, Trump’s cancellation immediately after Kim’s threat of nuclear war seems appropriate. It is also important to ignore partisan and sophomoric analysis in news and media ascribing a win-lose scenario in what is essentially a complex multivariate situation.

Put simply, if one thinks this was good or terrible for the United States, reflect on his or her worldview rather than the situation. It is a good day to remember that the liberal President Moon of South Korea is possibly feeling suicidal now, just as the conservative prime minister of Japan is feeling elated. If one views national security from a narrow conservative and realist prism, Kim just got Trumped, “bigly.”

It defies logic that Kim would, under any circumstances, be willing to give up his nuclear weapons, the ultimate guarantor of his life and rule in his small personal fiefdom. Nor should true-blue conservatives and foreign policy realists expect that to happen, regardless of any guarantee from Kim’s side.

Trump or his administration, whichever way one looks at it, deserves credit for the détente. Trump’s version of Madman Theory, his strategic ambiguity, worked to bring Kim to the table. If that leads in the future to a permanent peace in the region and the slow withdrawal of American forces, then that’s worth the effort and praise.

But it would be better to be a realist than an optimist about the prospects of total denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula. And one should always be ready to walk away.

"Despite Botched Summit with Putin, Trump Admin Still Pressuring Russia","On Monday, President Donald Trump managed to make a bad situation much, much worse. In a press conference held after his summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump strongly implied he agreed with Putin’s assessment that the Russians did not meddle in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though U.S. intelligence has concluded that they did. Despite Trump’s spectacular bungling of this diplomatic moment with Putin, the Trump administration is still pushing back hard against Moscow.

The optics going into the summit were already terrible. The U.S. foreign policy establishment, along with national security junkies and armchair quarterbacks, had been waiting with bated breath to see what would happen today when the two men met behind closed doors. The meeting was announced a couple of weeks ago to the surprise and feigned horror of many. For some, Trump’s decision to meet with Putin was further evidence of collusion between the two countries.

That’s no doubt partly why Trump agreed to the meeting. The U.S. president loves nothing so much as triggering his opponents on the Left, and this meeting certainly delivered on that promise. But no one was quite ready for the brazenness with which Trump appeared to side with Russia’s authoritarian leader.

At the press conference, Trump said, “[U.S.] intelligence agencies think it’s Russia. I have President Putin — he just said it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Putin, for his part, magnanimously offered to have Russian intelligence work with U.S, intelligence in investigating the alleged meddling, an offer that Trump called “incredible.”

The response to Trump’s comments has bordered on hysterical, and for good reason. Trump made both himself and the United States look utterly foolish in front of the steely eyed Putin, who no doubt is reveling in his ability to play both the president and the U.S. media. The ensuing chaos is music to his ears.

Not unlike Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the meeting with Putin validates a regime that has violated the borders of other sovereign nations, is propping up the Assad regime’s bloody war in Syria, is constantly provoking its neighbors, and has attempted to meddle in America’s elections. Russia is an adversary of the United States, plain and simple, and Trump just submissively rolled over onto his back — in front of the entire world.

But is this proof that Trump is in Putin’s pocket? That he’s beholden to Russia? That the United States has been utterly infiltrated by a foreign country? No, although that’s what the hysterical say. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted Monday that she continually wonders what the Russians have on Trump, writing that it’s the “only thing that explains [Trump’s] behavior & his refusal to stand up to Putin.”

But there’s a far simpler explanation: Trump was more concerned with sticking it to his domestic opponents than being tough with Putin. He’s trolling the Left in America — but he’s recklessly doing it on the international stage. He has allowed his own ego and his fight with the mainstream media and the Left over the Russia collusion narrative to dictate how he engages the leader of an adversarial foreign country.

Trump might be a pawn of Putin, but not in the way the media like to portray it. He’s a pawn because Putin has a good read on Trump and the domestic climate in America. He knows just which buttons to press, and how to play on Trump’s weaknesses.

Although Trump’s incredible statements at the press conference were irresponsible, naïve, and even dangerous, they do not reflect current U.S. policy toward Russia. And that’s a very good thing.

Consider what has actually happened since Trump took office. Congress has repeatedly sanctioned Russia and the Justice Department has indicted Russians for their various nefarious actions, including meddling with the 2016 election. The latest indictment came on Friday when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking the Democratic National Convention.

That indictment follows a separate, but related, indictment of 13 Russians and three Russian entities earlier this year. Let’s not forget that back in February, U.S. commandos killed as many as 300 Russian mercenaries in Syria, where the Trump administration has repeatedly pushed back against Russia’s military adventurism.

The same day as the Trump-Putin summit, two separate events took place. First, the Justice Department charged a Russian woman with being a foreign agent who was trying to arrange secret meetings between Trump and Putin. Second, U.S. Marines were training with their Ukrainian counterparts in military drills clearly aimed at preparing Ukraine for further conflict with Russia.

The Trump administration has also done something that the Obama administration refused to do: it authorized the sale of lethal arms to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, to help the country in its fight against separatists — that is to say, Russian forces — in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine.

The Trump administration has more or less adopted the correct policy toward Russia. Moreover, Trump does not wield dictatorial authority. He can’t unilaterally prop up or protect Russia, even if he wanted to. He’s restrained in these matters, as all presidents ought to be and, so far, he’s pursued rather punitive policies toward Moscow, his behavior in front of the cameras notwithstanding.

To be sure, Trump’s statements at the summit were startlingly reckless. They hurt America’s position in the world and weakened it in front of the unflappable Putin. But amid all the chaos and concern, it’s important to remember that for pushing back against Moscow, actions speak louder than words.

Why The Russians Are The Baddies Again,"The dominant mood of Donald Trump’s presidency, for those of us who care about the key causes of freedom and small government, is one of overhanging existential dread. Every so often, just when we begin to think Trump is tolerable, that we’ll get some good things out of this—deregulation at the Environmental Protection Agency, or a more reliable conservative majority on the Supreme Court—Trump goes out and does something that is simply inexcusable for an American president.

Last summer, it was calling Nazis “very fine people.” This summer, it’s holding a press conference with Vladimir Putin where Trump flipped his foreign policy from America First to Blame America First.

It started, naturally enough, with that national blight, Twitter. On the morning of his summit with Putin, Trump tweeted, “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” This retweet from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it all.

This is recognizable as a resurrection, from the Right, of the Left’s Cold War pastime of “blame America first,” in which anything that went wrong in the world, any tension between a free country and a brutal and aggressive dictatorship, was always America’s fault.

This wasn’t just Trump shooting his mouth off one time. It’s a point he repeated at the disastrous press conference following the meeting. Trump reiterated that the root of our problems with Russia is that “the United States has been foolish.” He even went so far as to throw his own director of national intelligence under the bus.

Asked about Russia’s role in hacking Democratic Party e-mails to interfere in the 2016 election, Trump replied, “My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”

Remember that Coats is not some shadowy “deep state” operative. He is Trump’s own appointee, charged with sifting through and coordinating our latest and best intelligence about what is going on in the world. One presumes that as Trump’s choice, he would have the president’s confidence, but in criticizing Russia, it appears that no one has the president’s confidence.

As with last summer’s statement about the Charlottesville Nazis, this is a situation where Trump is specifically called upon to dispel suspicions he is sympathetic to an enemy of American freedom and tolerance. The fact that he could not make the slightest effort to do so gives us no choice but to conclude that he is sympathetic and really does have a man-crush on Putin.

Is the mainstream media and the political left making that case in a hysterical and hyperbolic way? Of course they are. That’s like asking if the sky is still blue. But that’s no reason to dismiss the issue or to concoct some preposterous rationalization about how this is all really brilliant diplomacy and only looks like a total surrender.

Part of the problem is that it is now the Left who see Russians hiding under their beds, indulging themselves in all the paranoia they used to accuse us of back in the Cold War. But they’re so busy freaking out that they do a poor job of explaining exactly why Russia is bad and why Putin is so dangerous. Allow me to fill that gap with an overview of the Russian threat, because Mitt Romney was right all along: Russia is our number one geopolitical foe.

This is not to say that Russia is as direct a threat today as when they were the center of the Soviet empire during the Cold War. Russia has smaller and less well-equipped armed forces than it did back in the day, and while it still has plenty of nuclear weapons, we don’t face the kind of imminent threat of nuclear war that we did during the harrowing Cold War standoffs.

What remains, though, is the essence of the Cold War contest, just in a slightly new form. The fundamental contest in global politics is a choice between political models. Every country seeks to promote its own version of the ideal political system, in the hope that if other countries adopt the same institutions and values, their interests will naturally align.

The Communists sought to make every other country Communist, whether through propaganda, subversion, or outright invasion. Free nations—the ones with representative government, free markets, and the rule of law—seek common cause with other nations organized on those principles and try to spread our form of government wherever we can. This has been a central goal of America’s post-Cold War foreign policy, and not just under George W. Bush.

Today, Russia has flipped from Communism to nationalism, from a totalitarian dictatorship to one that is more authoritarian—though with the same old KGB guys in charge, funnily enough. They are also following the same basic foreign policy imperative: dictatorships always seek to remake the world in their own image.

So let us look at the basic elements of the Russian system and how they are working to spread it globally. The Russian system is rule by a strongman and his cronies, whose loyalty is rewarded with plenty of opportunities for special favors and state-sanctioned theft. His rule is supported by the prosecution of political rivals on trumped-up charges and the murder of dissidents and reporters. Most of all, Putin masterminded information manipulation by a state-controlled media that hides the truth in a maelstrom of propaganda and lies and prevents political opponents from breaking through to a mass audience.

All of this is bad enough if it’s just happening in Russia, but Putin has been projecting all of these political pathologies beyond Russia’s borders in every direction.

The old Soviet Union was an engine of global conflict, spurring numerous civil wars and insurgencies across the globe—in Asia, Africa, Latin America—in the hope of installing people’s republics that were not republics and didn’t answer to the people but to the Kremlin. Putin’s Russia has done the same thing on a somewhat smaller scale and closer to home, stoking a series of small wars and unresolved “frozen conflicts” along Russia’s borders. The idea is to create a zone of chaos around Russia, ensuring that its citizens will never encounter a nearby model of a free country.

Putin has specifically targeted Ukraine, which poses a uniquely powerful threat to his regime. As a nation with a large population of Russian speakers and a culture closely connected to Russia—it has long been considered by Russians to be a natural part of their domains—Ukraine has become a mecca for Russian dissidents and critics of the Putin regime. That’s why Putin wants to keep Ukraine permanently destabilized by sponsoring a rebellion of Russian speakers in the country’s Eastern provinces. It’s a “spontaneous” uprising that just happens to be carried out by mysteriously appearing Russian soldiers with lots of Russian military equipment—the so-called Little Green Men.

Russia has also attempted to pursue its interests by carrying its campaign of political murder across international borders. In Ukraine, this led to a recent real-life version of a spy novel, in which a Russian journalist and Putin critic living in Kiev faked his own death in cooperation with Ukrainian security services in order to expose a Russian assassination plot. Then, of course, there is the poisoning of a former KGB defector in Britain with a Russian-developed nerve agent, which has since led to the poisoning of two more Britons who live in the area—collateral damage in Putin’s global war of assassination against his rivals and critics.

Most of all, Russia is projecting into the world Putin’s permanent war of propaganda and disinformation. Russia’s FSB, the successor to Putin’s old KGB, runs “troll farms” where paid propagandists create anonymous social media accounts and try to inject the Kremlin’s agenda into other countries’ political discussions. Russia pioneered this approach in Finland and the Baltic states (where the trolls were opposed by a volunteer brigade of “elves”).

Aside from being places Putin still cherishes ambitions of Russian dominion, these countries have relatively small populations that can be overwhelmed by office buildings full of Russian propagandists sitting at computers. America is a much larger country, so Russian troll farms have had a more marginal impact, and those who think Russian trolls tipped the election are surely exaggerating. But it wasn’t from lack of trying.

Yet Putin doesn’t have to tip elections to achieve his goal. He achieves it merely by sowing chaos and discord, which serves his goal of discrediting free countries as a superior model of government. Those who have followed my work for a while know my fascination with the concept of “normal life,” the revolutionary notion that living in a vibrant free society is, or should be, a kind of metaphysical norm. The more conflict Putin sows in the West, the more he is able to point to the world’s vaunted democracies and sneer that this kind of “normal life” is all an arrogant delusion.

From that perspective, Trump’s presidency is a triumph of Putin’s information war. Trump’s comments at yesterday’s press conference were in response to exactly the kind of domestic discord the troll armies set out to amplify. Trump is now far more determined to fight his internal enemies and their “Rigged Witch Hunt” than he is to stand up to America’s geopolitical foes. The FSB ought to hang up a “Mission Accomplished” banner.

Remember that the big contest is between different models of government, which is why in addition to his troll army’s information war, Putin has been backing nationalist agitators in Europe and Eastern European politicians who want to follow his lead. Putin’s model is one of personal rule, strongman authoritarianism, and endless internal disinformation, all of it based on appeals to a narrow and intolerant version of “traditional values,” outright xenophobia, a touchy, defensive nationalism, and calls for national “greatness” that are cover for fear of national decline. Trump is a Russian triumph in that regard, too, because he has bought into all of this hook, line, and sinker—and so have his reflexive, hard-core defenders.

That has always been the danger of Trump—not some kind of overt “collusion” with the Russians, but the prospect that he defines national greatness the same way Putin does and wants to achieve it through the same means. This would be a disaster for actual American interests in the same way it has been a disaster for Russia’s actual interests. But the biggest disaster is that it undermines our model of government in its contest with Russia’s model of the nationalist strongman.

This is why Russia is, once again, America’s main geopolitical antipode. It didn’t have to be this way, and Trump’s predecessors certainly could have done a lot more about it, rather than dismissing the threat. But Trump has done far worse, giving the Putin model of government the kind of ideological victory it craves. If the president of the United States is supposed to be “leader of the free world,” then the free world finds itself with a leader who is under the influence of the enemy.

Here’s What Trump And NATO Should Do About Russia’s Aggressions,"President Trump’s North Atlantic Treaty Organization visit caused quite a stir. He rebuffed the Europeans and Canadians for their lack of will to spend even the minimum of what they pledged on defense.

Beleaguered German Prime Minister Angela Merkel was rebuked for working back-channel deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin to purchase 69 percent of her nation’s energy needs from Russia. This makes Germany the Achilles heel of the alliance. While other nations such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are working hard to get off Russian oil and gas, Germany is becoming addicted to it.

Finally, Trump admonished the NATO alliance for taking advantage of America’s generosity and goodwill in defending them by creating socialist utopias on the backs of the American taxpayers. The president’s comments regarding many of the NATO member states are justified. The strategic environment in Europe changed abruptly in 2014 when Putin began his four-year war against Ukraine.

Although all of the NATO members pledged to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product, few have achieved that goal. This shortcoming includes several of the economically prosperous nations, such as Germany, Canada and France. The United States has been very patient, perhaps too patient on this issue, especially when Germany’s Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron, and Canada’s Justin Trudeau have no misgivings about shamelessly ranting against American foreign policy.

Vladimir Putin’s Series of Escalating Aggressions

Now it’s Putin’s turn. His rise as the uncontested leader of Russia has unleashed a troubling reactionary ethno-centric nationalism. This included glorifying even the dark days of the Soviet Empire and doing all that could be to raise Russia back to an important international player.

The first manifestation of Russia’s growing hostility towards NATO and NATO-inclined nations began in 2007 when Moscow unleashed a crippling cyber-attack against Estonia. This was punishment for moving a Soviet-era memorial located in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. This was followed in 2008 by a devastating Russian attack on Georgia, resulting in the complete loss of the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

But not until 2014 did NATO begin to dispel its fantasy of a post-Cold War world with a friendly and cooperative Russia. That year, the pro-Moscow government was replaced by a pro-western one. Fearing the loss of its strategically vital Black Sea ports, Putin unleashed his army. So-called “little green men” appeared across Crimea and, without firing a shot, seized this Ukrainian territory.

At first Putin denied that these “little green men” were Russian troops. This flabbergasted the weak President Obama and feckless European leaders, who dithered about what to do. Putin then quickly annexed Crimea, declaring that it was his duty to protect ethnic Russians wherever they live. Not since Adolf Hitler’s 1938 Sudetenland speech did a leader declare such a policy in the continent.

This was followed quickly by a Moscow-orchestrated “ethnic Russian” uprising in eastern Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk). The war has been raging now for four years with no resolution or abatement in sight. The Kremlin’s new adaptive approach is what I call the “Strategy of Ambiguity.”

Moscow’s Strategy of Ambiguity

The “Strategy of Ambiguity” exploits the advantage Moscow has with any ethnic Russian population residing in neighboring countries. It practice, this begins with Russian special forces and intelligence officers appearing in ethnic Russian enclaves in neighboring countries, dressed as civilians and endeavoring to export an uprising to destabilize and area.

The purpose of this ambiguity is to avoid a direct confrontation with NATO. Should NATO uncharacteristically quickly respond to such a threat, Putin has plausible deniability and simply walks back from a potential clash with the West. He used such a cloak of ambiguity to confound North American and European decision makers regarding Ukraine.

Should the NATO alliance get caught up in endless debates and inaction, it would then be time to turn up the heat with a “local” and “civilian” proxy takeover of the enclave that would eventually appeal to Moscow to send in its army to help the besieged ethnic Russian populace.

At risk for such a Moscow-inspired “attack” are the NATO Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three have a border with Russia, with Estonia and Latvia including a sizeable ethnic Russian population living in their nations.

Compounding matters is their geography. The so called “unsinkable Russian aircraft carrier” of Kaliningrad sits astride Lithuania and Poland and is positioned to make air and sea reinforcement of the Baltic nations difficult, if not impossible, with its advanced weaponry. This leaves a narrow land corridor only 60 miles wide connecting Poland to the region. Called the Suwalki Gap, this area is of vital strategic importance should war come to the area.

How This All Bears on Trump’s Meeting with Putin

President Trump’s first meeting with Putin was designed to begin healing of some of the issues standing between the Russian Federation and the United States. Putin may have captured the essence of the Democrat Party’s unusual hostility towards Moscow by rebuffing them for trying to implicate Russia in a domestic internal power struggle.

This seems to be the rub for the American Left. Despite the hand-wringing and remonstrations about what President Trump did and did not say to Putin, there is much to contend with between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. Sadly, the ongoing Mueller investigation and its ill-timed indictments of 12 Russian operatives shifted focus from more pressing issues concerning American relations with Russia.

One of the most important issues that should be addressed is regional security in Europe. President Trump should make clear that, although the United States has concerns with NATO, America stands by its commitment to Article 5 (an attack upon one is an attack upon all). Putin needs to understand that no infringement of NATO nations will be tolerated and that the Kremlin’s propaganda blitz directed toward the Russian diaspora living in the Baltics must end.

What Else the Administration Should Do about Russia

Additionally, Moscow’s war against Ukraine must end, with a return of Crimea to Kiev. Trump should also announce a modest increase to the American force posture in Northern Europe to back up his commitment with action, fulfilling his policy of peace through strength. The current rotational force levels are woefully inadequate to serve as a deterrent against Putin-inspired adventurism in the Baltic States.

As one Estonian official told me, 300 American soldiers in the Baltics are worth more than 30,000 in Germany. Russia has a long history of attacking weak nations, and Putin must understand that he can’t meddle or intervene in any NATO country, especially Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Kremlin perceiving a misstep or perceived weakness in the NATO alliance could have catastrophic consequences. A moderately stronger forward U.S. troop presence in the Baltics would go far to draw a line in the sand against any foolish notions that Putin may entertain.

If anything, the lessons of history are clear: weakness results in war, while strength and resolve leads to peace. We have a president who speaks the hard truth to advance an America First agenda. Peace and stability in Europe are in the interests of the United States.

Yes, the allies must do much more to share the burden of defense. Yes, the allies must renegotiate one-sided trade deals that rob American wealth. And yes, American prestige is on the line should Putin attempt to undermine the NATO alliance with a risky move. Reaffirming the American commitment to Article 5 of the Washington treaty would go a long way to send a clear message to Putin that he must not meddle with our allies in Europe.

"Just Like Obama, Trump’s Russia Policy Speaks Louder Than His Words","Following Monday’s summit in Helsinki, many American pundits and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized President Trump for what they perceived as his failure to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) slammed Trump’s “shameful” performance, and former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan went so far as to call Putin the “master puppeteer” of the Oval Office.

Some may expect me to lend my voice to this chorus of condemnation. After all, I have personally experienced the devastating consequences of Putin’s expansionism. In 2008, when I was the president of Georgia, Russia shocked the world by invading my country. To this day, one-fifth of Georgia’s territory remains under illegal Russian occupation, and Georgia lacks a clear roadmap to NATO membership.

The Helsinki summit did not change my view of the Russian president. As I have reiterated many times, Putin is pure evil. There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. intelligence agencies arrived at the correct conclusion: Russia did meddle in the U.S. 2016 election, and Putin himself directed the operation. Again, I speak from personal experience on this topic: In 2012, Russian intelligence services interfered in the Georgian parliamentary elections, boosting the Kremlin’s preferred candidate through disinformation operations.

Thus, my opinion of President Trump’s policy vis-à-vis Russia is perhaps more positive than one might assume from my background. My reasoning is two-fold: After a lifetime of firsthand experience with Russian aggression, I must evaluate Trump’s actions against the proper historical context. In doing so, I have found that Trump’s actions speak for themselves.

The Outrage Seems Selective

On the first point, I consider it unfair that Trump’s performance in Helsinki has garnered harsher criticism than other incidents in recent memory. In 2012, for example, a hot microphone at a global nuclear security summit picked up then-President Barack Obama assuring Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” to negotiate with Putin after the presidential election.

During a debate with GOP opponent Mitt Romney the same year, Obama casually dismissed the Russian threat, quipping: “The 1980s called; they want their foreign policy back.” Although Trump could certainly have been more forceful by condemning Putin’s crimes, his statements at the Helsinki press conference were nowhere near as concerning as his predecessor’s remarks about Russia.

This brings me to my second point: Trump’s actions toward Russia speak louder than words—and so did his predecessor’s. Indeed, the Obama administration’s foreign policy undermined America’s credibility in my region, which Putin considers Russia’s “backyard.” There are many opinions about Trump’s rhetoric on Crimea, but it is a fact that the Russian land grab in Ukraine happened on Obama’s watch.

How, exactly, did this happen? During and after Ukraine’s revolution of 2014, which ousted a Kremlin-backed dictator, on a daily basis the United States cautioned Ukraine not to escalate in response to Russian aggression. Thus, Putin saw an opportunity to annex Crimea without risking a direct confrontation with the West—and he seized it. Putin is a bully, but not a fool.

What a Difference Two Years Makes

Rather than changing his course after Moscow redrew the borders of Europe by force, Obama doubled down. Despite bipartisan consensus in favor of selling lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, and vocal support from his own administration officials (including Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton), Obama repeatedly refused to authorize the sales.

Instead of anti-tank weapons, the Ukrainians defending their territory from Russian invasion received hot blankets and canned goods from the Obama administration. At the same time, Obama asserted that the Ukraine conflict had “no military solution.” With these words—and more importantly, these actions—he was perceived by some on the Russian side as accepting the Kremlin’s sphere of influence in Ukraine.

Despite my warnings, the Obama administration also essentially turned a blind eye to Russian meddling in Georgia’s 2012 elections. The result was devastating not only for Georgia, but for American interests: A Kremlin-backed oligarch (who has substantial interests in Russian energy firm Gazprom) ascended to power in a strategic U.S. ally. Moreover, Russia’s meddling in Georgia’s elections functioned as a proving ground for information operations later used in the United States. To his credit, Obama accepted this reality in 2016, when he expelled dozens of Russian diplomats, but this response was too little, too late.

By contrast, Trump authorized the sale of lethal defensive weapons to both Ukraine and Georgia in 2017. The Trump administration went beyond the congressional mandate in sanctioning Russian authorities involved in the annexation of Crimea. Earlier this year, the United States imposed the harshest sanctions yet, targeting Russian oligarchs as well as government officials.

Trump’s rhetoric on energy at the Helsinki summit, which has been largely overlooked, is also a reason for optimism. The backbone of the Russian economy is energy, and Russia’s dependence on fossil fuels is Putin’s Achilles heel. At Monday’s press conference, Trump stated that U.S. liquefied natural gas exports would “compete” with Russian gas in Europe. This reflects Trump’s comments at the NATO summit, where he criticized Germany for supporting the Nord Stream II pipeline. Trump was correct to call attention to this project, which will enrich the Kremlin at the expense of struggling pro-Western allies like Ukraine.

Trump Should Amp Up American Commitments

Nevertheless, I must caution President Trump that criticizing domestic opponents in front of foreign adversaries could have been misperceived by Putin as a concession. To quell this impression and fend off undesirable consequences, I recommend taking several steps.

First, the U.S. should return to the Reagan-era policy of containing Russia on every front. Trump’s support for a stronger military is central to this strategy. Just as President Reagan advanced “peace through strength,” Trump’s proposal for a Space Force echoes Reagan’s “Star Wars” defense program.

Reagan-era increases in military spending escalated the collapse of the USSR, as the Soviet economy could no longer sustain competition with the United States on military innovation and readiness. Likewise, Trump’s strengthening of U.S. defense will overstretch Russia’s resources to the breaking point. This is especially true when the Russian economy is weak, as it is today, and Russian power-brokers are cut off from capital markets due to sanctions.

Another way to contain Putin’s ambitions is to step up NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe, offering countries like Georgia and Ukraine a roadmap to accession. In calling on NATO allies to increase military spending in line with their commitments to collective defense—while increasing the Pentagon’s budget—Trump is already taking a step in the right direction.

In his interview with Chris Wallace after the summit, Putin again articulated Russia’s bid for an exclusive zone of influence in Eastern Europe, stating that Russia would never allow Georgia or Ukraine to join NATO. The United States must also unequivocally refuse Russia’s bid for hegemony. America is at its strongest when conducting foreign policy that upholds American values.

Second, if Russian adventurism continues, Trump should respond by activating the “nuclear option” of sanctions: Blocking Russia’s access to the SWIFT international payment system. Moreover, Trump could amplify the impact of the effective sanctions against Russian oligarchs, by expanding these sanctions to Kremlin-connected businesses and individuals outside Russia, and their offshore accounts worldwide. The United States should also consider restricting the registration of Russian shell companies, which are often used for money laundering.

While these tough measures on Russia would advance U.S. interests and the security of my region, diplomacy is also necessary. We do not know what Trump and Putin discussed behind closed doors in Helsinki, and we should not make assumptions. As Reagan continued to meet with Soviet leadership until the Axis of Evil disintegrated, so Trump should continue talking to Putin.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/07/18/just-like-obama-trumps-russia-policy-speaks-louder-words/,2018-07-18
10 Key Takeaways From Released FISA Warrants Against Carter Page,"In a surprise move, on Saturday evening the Department of Justice released copies of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications used to obtain a secret court order to conduct electronic surveillance on former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. The 412 pages of documents turned over in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by several media outlets included the initial October 2016 application and the three applications for renewal of the surveillance order.

While the newly released documents remain heavily redacted, the details revealed confirm the charges of abuse laid out early this year by House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA). The documents also provide additional evidence that the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and career DOJ, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and State Department employees misused the FISA court system to spy on the Trump campaign. Here are ten key take-aways.

1. The State Department Had Its Fingers In this Mess

Last month, during a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing, it was revealed for the first time that “[f]ormer British spy Christopher Steele visited the State Department in October 2016 and briefed officials there about his work on the infamous anti-Trump dossier.” During questioning of President Barack Obama’s assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland, committee Chairman Richard Burr disclosed that “[b]ased upon our review of the visitor logs at the State Department, Mr. Steele visited the State Department, briefing officials on the dossier in October 2016.”

Nuland, who in June 2016 had authorized the FBI to meet with Steele in London, denied attending the October 2016 meeting with Steele. She also “said in previous interviews that she and other State Department officials referred the dossier to the FBI,” but as The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross noted, “Burr’s revelations suggest the agency maintained interest in Steele and his report much longer than previously known.”

Saturday’s release of the FISA applications now exposes a new troubling detail: The DOJ sought the FISA surveillance order based on the information provided “by the U.S. Department of State” “in or about October 2016.” When considered in light of last month’s revelation that Steele had met with State Department officials in October, it now appears that the Obama administration’s State Department bore equal responsibility for presenting the FISA court unverified hearsay to justify spying on the Trump campaign.

2. The Applications Relied Heavily on the Steele Dossier

In charging the DOJ and FBI with abusing the FISA system, Republicans have long maintained that the FISA applications relied heavily on the Steele dossier’s unverified information—information the former British spook compiled for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

Democrats challenge that assertion, stressing the bulk of the FISA applications and other information included. Although the redactions make it impossible to fully refute these claims, the FISA applications demonstrate the DOJ’s heavy reliance on the Steele dossier.

First, while the initial FISA application totals some 50 pages, large swaths of the double-spaced length consist of boilerplate jargon detailing the requested scope of the surveillance, claiming “compliance” with the statutory requirements for certification by FBI officials, and efforts to minimization the unintentional interception of third-party information.

Then there are the long narratives of background information concerning Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Only a relatively small portion of the total applications go to the question of whether probable cause exists to surveil Page. Those sections rely on the information the Steele dossier provided.

3. The FBI Paid Christopher Steele

It has long been known that the Clinton campaign and DNC paid Steele to compile the dossier. Media outlets have also reported, though, that the FBI did not compensate Steele. For instance, the Washington Post ran a story asserting, based on “several people familiar with the arrangement,” that Steele “had reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him,” but “[u]ltimately, the FBI did not pay Steele.” In another article, the Washington Post again claimed Steele was “not being paid as an informant,” but added that he may have been reimbursed for some travel expenses.

Those reports now appear questionable: The FISA applications state that Steele (identified as Source #1), “has been compensated” “by the FBI.” The redactions, though, leave open the question of how much and whether any of the payments compensated Steele for investigating the Trump campaign.

4. Warrants Relied On Hearsay from Tertiary Sources

The newly released FISA applications also confirm a fourth significant fact: To obtain the surveillance warrant, the DOJ and FBI relied on unverified hearsay from sub-sources (i.e., Steele’s sources) of unknown reliability.

While the government may rely on unverified information provided by an informant who has a history of providing reliable information, to establish probable cause with evidence coming from a source of unknown reliability, the government must corroborate that information. The FISA applications make no mention of corroboration of the sub-sources’ claims concerning Page’s purported conversations with two Russian agents.

Further, the FISA applications reveal that the DOJ only established Steele’s reliability, not that of “sub-sources.” But as former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy first highlighted in February 2018:

The only reliability that counts is the reliability of the factual informants, not of the investigator who purports to channel the informants. The judge wants to know why the court should believe the specific factual claims: Was the informant truly in a position to witness what is alleged, and if so, does the informant have a track record of providing verified information? The track record of the investigator who locates the sources is beside the point. A judge would need to know whether Steele’s sources were reliable, not whether Steele himself was reliable.

While we do not know what lay behind the redacted portions of the applications, it seems clear from the placement, context, size of the blackouts that the FBI did not include information in the application either establishing the sub-sources’ reliability or detailing any efforts to corroborate Page’s claimed collusion with the Russian agents.

5. The DOJ Used News Outlets to Establish Probable Cause

The FISA applications further exposed the extent to which the DOJ relied on unverified media reports to support their request for court-ordered electronic surveillance of Page. Contrary to Democrat claims that the applications’ reliance on a Yahoo News article was passing, the FISA documents detailed the Yahoo News article’s assertion that a “well-placed Western intelligence source,” told the news organization that Page met with the Russian agents in July.

Just as statements from unverified “sub-sources” could not establish probable cause, unverified newspaper articles could not either. The DOJ, however, did not limit itself to repeating the Yahoo News article’s claims, which the public later learned had also originated from Steele. The FISA application also cited two other media reports.

One was apparently Josh Rogin’s Washington Post opinion article, which reported claims that Trump campaign members “worked behind the scenes to make sure [the GOP]’s platform would not call for giving weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces.” The DOJ also relied on an article from August 2016—likely the Michael Crowley Politico piece—that “opined that while the reason for [Trump’s] shift [in Russian policy] was not clear, [Trump]’s more conciliatory words, which contradict [the GOP]’s official platform, follow [Trump]’s recent association with several people sympathetic to Russian influence in Ukraine, including foreign policy advisor Carter Page.”

There are two fundamental problems with this portion of the FISA application. First, as the Washington Examiner’s Byron York explained, the GOP platform narrative the Washington Post and Politico pushed was extremely misleading. Second, when I asked Page whether he participated in the GOP Russia platform debate, the former Trump advisor responded with an emphatic “NEVER,” and shared this excerpt from his defamation lawsuit against a media conglomerate:

Plaintiff, Dr. Page arrived on Delta flight 5353 at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport at 1:36 p.m. on July 18, 2016, the same day that the Washington Post published the following report: ‘Trump campaign guts GOP’s anti-Russia stance on Ukraine’. (Delta Air Lines flight confirmation attached as Exhibit 19(a)) Dr. Page played no role whatsoever in the drafting of the 2016 Republican party platform.

The FISA applications create the false impression that Page was involved with the GOP platform debate. The DOJ then used that misleading inference to support its claim that Page was a foreign agent.

6. The DOJ Effectively Criminalized GOP Foreign Policy

The above discussion also reveals another troubling aspect of the Obama administration’s investigation into the Trump campaign: The DOJ used leaked information from internal GOP’s platform debates as “evidence” of collusion.

Also disconcerting is the DOJ’s reliance on Trump’s “conciliatory words” toward Russia in conflict with GOP insiders to justify spying on the Trump campaign—in effect criminalizing foreign policy differences concerning Ukraine.

7. Why Were the Dates Redacted?

There is yet another oddity in Saturday’s release, but of unknown relevance: The dates in the applications and warrants were redacted. Why? One possibility: The dates of the verification of the applications coincide with (or near) the dates the FISA court issued the surveillance orders, demonstrating that the judges served as a mere rubber stamp on the requests and did not do a thorough review of the information.

8. The FISA Applications Didn’t Establish Probable Cause

The next three key-take away from the FISA applications prove more global in scope.

First, the unredacted portions of the FISA applications present a detailed theory of collusion but lack the supporting evidence necessary to establish probable cause. The FBI—in its own words— “believes that the Russian Government’s [interference] efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Trump.”

The DOJ storyline then runs that Russian agents connected to Vladimir Putin promised Page an ownership interest in a Russian company and dirt on Hillary Clinton in exchange for Trump resetting relations with Russia following his election. Their “evidence” of Page’s collusion was unverified hearsay from sub-sources and the GOP’s platform fight—the latter of which Page had nothing to do with.

9. The FISA Court Clearly Needs Revamping

I’ve spent nearly 25 years reviewing probable cause affidavits and court records, so I can say this “evidence” is laughable. Yet four separate FISA court judges approved the wiretap orders. There seems to be only one logical conclusion: The FISA court system has become a rubber stamp to whatever applications the DOJ submits.

As soon as Republicans clean up Spygate, they should turn their eyes to the FISA court. But that might take some time, given that the expansive Deep State stench points to an Augean stable to clean.

10. Heavy Redactions Will Give Dems Cover

While the just-released FISA applications provide further evidence of abuse by the Obama administration and career DOJ, FBI, and State Department employees, Democrats are hiding behind the extensive redactions to claim the government properly sought the Page surveillance order. However, the previously released House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes’ memo, Rep. Adam Schiff’s Democratic response, and Sen. Chuck Grassley’s (IA-R) criminal referral of Steele provide great insight into the content of the redacted information.

As I detailed last week, it is extremely likely that the yet-to-be disclosed information includes several additional false DOJ narratives. Nunes, who has access to the unredacted FISA documents, should now revisit the applications and release a supplemental memo addressing these concerns.

Meet Ukrainian Victims Of The United States’s Proxy War With Russia,"My parents escaped from the Soviet Union for political freedom. I have found from my experiences that evolution is not solely the transmission of genes, but also of hopes and dreams. Their desire to spread liberty lives inside me.

It is also carried on by my relatives in Ukraine, who spill their sweat and blood on battlefields and in factories to hold true to these principles. In America, we consider them freedom fighters who yearn for autonomy from an encroaching political powerhouse. The opposing rebels are painted in the same light in the Russian Federation. Two peoples, fighting for the same ideals, give their lives for a land that only 16 percent of Americans can find on a map.

The date was February 23, 2014. Pro-Putin Ukrainian President Yanukovych succumbed to the pressure from a bloody, five-month-long riot, and decided to pull back his mercenary guards and flee the country. The event spiraled into the Russian annexation of Crimea and a Russian-sponsored separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine that plagues the country and its impoverished inhabitants to this day.

The date was June 23, 2015. It had not been long long since Russian separatists had shot down a civilian plane, killing the nearly 300 innocent people on board and then (per usual) denying any and all responsibility. Despite the poor track record with flights, my family showed little fear in visiting our relatives in Ukraine. After all, they live more thaan a hundred miles from the battlefields, and I had not seen my grandparents in ages. We soon realized they too fight the war.

Prices are high and supplies of essentials are low. My aunt, a physician, witnesses every day how trucks carrying injured soldiers, and even body parts, arrive at the hospital. Many young men are beyond salvation. However, she has learned to do whatever can and needs to be done. These are the daily casualties of a war that the West helped to start, but has long since forgotten about.

My septuagenarian grandfather, who drags his swollen legs to a military factory on three buses daily, fell ill while we were visiting. His heart is weak, and due to the shortage of medications and emotional burden of war, he was hospitalized. His job pays under a hundred dollars a month, five times less than the inflated cost of the life-essential drugs he needs.

If he were to retire, he would receive half as much. Unless you are an oligarch, retirement in Ukraine means starvation. Savings are worthless thanks to the astronomical inflation of the currency brought about by war. Worst of all, he is unable to even apply for a green card to the United States, because Ukraine considers his knowledge of military production a “state secret.” The only secret is that their technology is woefully behind that of Russia and the developed world.

My cousin Alex, inspired by his mother and grandfather, has enrolled in medical school. Unfortunately, he stands the risk of being drafted into the Ukrainian military at any point. He fears joining the scores of maimed young men that his mother treats daily. He is an avid swimmer and medical student like me. He has grown up without knowing half of his family, as have I. However, unlike me, he was not born in the United States, and is not even allowed to visit for a few weeks, let alone immigrate.

His and his mother’s plights are especially shameful considering that the United States is expecting a shortage of 120,000 physicians by the year 2030. Nevertheless, under the orders of the U.S. State Department, Alex has been denied a visitor’s visa countless times. The United States is all too eager to waste billions supporting “democracy” abroad. Yet they cannot afford the money to improve legal immigration to help provide essential freedoms, such as the ability to see a doctor, here at home.

My relatives are the faces of the many victims of U.S. military involvement. Ukraine’s revolution, fueled by empty Western promises of European integration and CIA propaganda, has ground to a standstill. The war rages on with no end in sight, fought with Russian and American weapons and Ukrainian lives.

Despite the seven hundred civilians who perished in the “revolution,” and the thousands of young men who continue to die every year, the Soviet culture of oligarchs and kickbacks rebelled remains unchanged. As much as 50 percent of the nation’s annual healthcare budget is embezzled and stolen, as is likely the case with other sectors as well. Recently, Ikea was unable to open its first Ukrainian store because the company could not figure out who to bribe, and why. Whether under new leadership or old, Ukraine’s legacy of corruption has persisted, warding away foreign investment and skirting its chances at entering the EU.

In fact, the only way Ukraine can seem to get any attention anymore from the United States is through military involvement. When the pro-Russia separatists mistakenly shot down a civilian plane in 2015, Ukraine was thrust back into the news cycle for a few weeks. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has any incentive to tone down the hostilities. With every bullet fired, the Ukrainian government gets more military aid from the West, while Putin wards NATO away from his borders. Ukraine has even stooped to inviting wealthy tourists to shoot, drive tanks, or detonate explosives as a means of raise funds. Of course, the Ukrainian people get nothing.

Ukraine sought the right to self-determination but ended up a perpetual clashing ground for two competing superpowers. Although the conflict has lost the world’s attention, thousands of young Ukrainian men continue to perish annually. According to my aunt, who interacts with the soldiers daily, many are sent out without proper training and equipment. They are a lost generation. Some gladly agree to the pitiful salary (with bonuses based on battles fought), while others are drafted against their will. Those fighting on the Russian side go completely unregistered, dying as mercenaries without their families ever learning where or why.

The soldiers tell my aunt that sometimes the battles are more show than substance. Both sides agree to planned artillery fire in order to please their sponsors. “You bomb our warehouse at 6, we’ll bomb yours at 8, both Russia and the United States will be happy, and our middle-man employers will offer us a small bonus for our troubles.” This is the kind of Catch-22-esque “struggle for democracy” on which we waste billions of dollars.

As George Santayana adroitly put it, “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”

The Ukrainian “struggle for freedom” is matched only by the suffering of the denizens of Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Syria, who have seen their lives and livelihoods perish in a geopolitical game of poker. No one ever calls the bluff, and the proxy wars carry on, eating away at the surpluses of the developed world, and squandering entire generations. Among these are my grandparents, aunts and cousins, who could benefit both their country and ours better in peace than war.

We must learn from our past mistakes and work diplomatically with Russia rather than antagonizing them with special investigations and unproven accusations. We cannot blame and punish their voiceless citizenry for the authoritarian regimes under which they live, many of which we, at one point or another, helped to enable.

Our best path forward is to welcome Russians, Ukrainians and other victims of autocracy into our country, and back into the fold of reality and freedom, with open arms. At the same time, we must never give in to relativism and relinquish our moral high ground over communism, teaching these lost others by example. Halfway across the world, my family must fight and die for the freedoms that we take for granted. The best way to honor their sacrifice is to uphold the rights we preach, at home and abroad.

Why Putin’s Game Of Russian Roulette With Ukraine Is A Big Deal,"In a stunning sequence of events, the Russian military opened fire then seized three Ukrainian navy vessels in an unprovoked attack on the Black Sea last Sunday. In the melee, several Ukrainian sailors were wounded and 24 captured. Moscow followed up this flagrant act of war by parading the sailors on Russian television to give clearly coerced confessions of guilt.

This attack is but the latest escalation in the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine that has been churning since 2014. It’s also the first great test for the Trump administration regarding Russia and one that will have lasting consequences on the future of Europe and the world.

Moscow’s Strategy Of Ambiguity

The war in Ukraine began in 2014 after Russian special forces seized Crimea. The tactic Moscow used is what I dubbed, in U.S. Army publications, “the strategy of ambiguity.” Putin directed that his troops remove all symbols and anything else that would identify them as Russian soldiers.

This had the desired effect, as American journalists breathlessly reported of the ridiculously labeled “little green men” from unknown origins taking control of Crimea. President Obama and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies wrung their hands on what to do. The tactic worked––as President Obama dithered, Russia seized Crimea within a week without firing a shot in anger.

The takeover of Crimea was quickly followed by local referenda to ascertain if Crimea desired to become part of Russia––a vote, of course, that overwhelmingly supported the idea. The deal was sealed just a month after the little green men seized the country, with Putin announcing that Crimea would be annexed by Russia.

His speech was given to the Duma (Russia’s parliament) with much fanfare, but had chilling similarities to another dark time in history. Putin proclaimed that it was his duty and responsibility to protect ethnic Russians wherever they reside. This begs the question: how far geographically does his ethnic-based strategy extend?

Although Putin’s war against Ukraine is going into its fourth year, there has been a disconcerting pattern of aggression from him for more than a decade. The first test was an all-out cyber attack against NATO member Estonia in 2007, attributable to Russia. The attack was launched by Moscow in retaliation for Estonia’s decision to move a Soviet-era war shrine out of the center of its capital, Tallinn, after it became a hotbed of ethnic Russian unrest. The cyber attack punished Estonia for not heeding Moscow’s demands not to move the monument.

The next test came in 2008, when Russia launched a massive invasion of the nation of Georgia, which had most of its small army deployed in Iraq fighting an American war. When the guns fell silent, Moscow formally annexed two large swaths of Georgian territory, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Encouraged by the lack of resolve in the United States and its allies, Moscow followed up in 2014 with the invasion and annexation of Crimea, and with Putin’s now-infamous speech of ethnic expansionism. President Obama faltered in the face of the Russian aggression and failed to do anything substantive to deter further aggression.

Putin’s Quiet War

Buoyed by this appeasement and weakness, Putin took the next bold step of exporting an ethnic Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine. That war has droned on now for four years, leaving behind 10,000 dead and a rebel force largely in Luhansk and Donetsk with more tanks (compliments of Moscow) than the German army has in its inventory. The Ukrainians have done well in blunting the Moscow-led, -planned, and -orchestrated attack on their nation, but at a high cost in lives and treasure.

Putin’s problem is that, at this point, he needs to avoid a direct confrontation with the United States and NATO. He is in a precarious position economically and his military is still two years from completing part of its modernization and overhaul. Moscow has found in the latest rounds of aggression that using a fabricated proxy force in Ukraine as a cover to provide plausible deniability that it’s truly behind the conflict. This is what makes the Russian naval attack on Ukraine significant. It is the first overt and direct confrontation between Moscow and Kiev since 2014.

The stalemate in Eastern Ukraine is costly to Putin financially and politically. When Moscow deployed its special forces and intelligence operatives into Donesk and Luhansk in early 2014, by all accounts, Russia expected a quick victory by the “rebels” who would then ask to be incorporated into greater Russia. This did not happen and Ukraine’s armed forces have been able to prevent Moscow from declaring any sort of victory there.

It seems that the Russian navy attack in the Black Sea is another avenue to bring Ukraine to its knees, by severing its access to the Kerch Straits and the Azov Sea. Putin has slowly strangled Kiev’s lifeline to this vital area over the past months by limiting the number of vessels that could pass through the straits where 25 percent of Ukrainian exports flow to the west and elsewhere.

The Russian attack on the Ukrainian navy this past Sunday is Putin’s pretext to seal off the Kerch Straits from all Ukrainian shipping, and will bring Kiev to its knees economically. The move is a brilliant one for Moscow. By taking this “indirect approach,” Putin will be in a position to break the Ukrainians economically and outflank them militarily by sea east of Crimea.

Appeasement Only Emboldens Expansionist Leaders

The lesson of the past is that appeasement and accommodation only emboldens expansionist leaders. Putin pressed the West for more than a decade and faced tepid responses. If this latest provocation by Putin remains unchallenged, the Ukrainian economy will collapse, and the relative stalemate on its eastern front will result in a Russian breakthrough. The simple fact is that Kiev cannot maintain its forces there with the disintegration of its economy or being entirely cut off from the Sea of Azov.

This need not be an American war; Ukraine can fight and win it with the right policy and tools at its disposal. In the short term, the United States and NATO should increase its supply of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to tip the scales back into balance in the land battle. Additionally, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles should be provided to Kiev to defend against this latest Russian provocation.

Furthermore, all NATO countries, especially Germany, must cease purchasing Russian oil and gas. Europe’s addiction to Moscow’s energy has made them unwilling and unable to take a determined stand against Putin’s expanding torrent of aggression in the region. This explains Angela Merkel’s consistently tepid response to Russian aggression––Merkel needs Russian oil and gas, and any interruption of it would have catastrophic results for Germany’s economy.

Since most of Western Europe spends barely 1 percent of their GDP on defense, they owe it to the United States to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on the North Sea and pay a little extra to import American energy. It is madness to enrich a leader in Russia who spends that revenue to create a military force that threatens European security. Once Europe is weaned off Russian energy, an effective economic embargo can be implemented that will discourage Russia from behaving badly.

We Must Not Tolerate This

It is time to draw the line in the sand and not tolerate this provocation. President Trump is facing his first test from Putin and must come out with an unequivocal statement condemning Moscow for its blatant aggression against Ukraine, then follow it up with concerted action.

Putin is a regional bully who only understands strength. America is being tested, both in its commitment to the European alliance and its resolve to maintain the international order. Failure to act will result in the collapse of Ukraine’s economy and rout of its forces on its eastern front. If this happens, the spark of freedom there will be snuffed out yet again by Russian imperialism.

It is imperative that the United States and the entire NATO membership stand unified against Putin’s “ethnic-Russian” ambitions in Europe and meet any further challenges with concerted action and force. If the United States falters, expect Russia to test NATO’s resolve in the Baltics, especially Estonia and Latvia, both of which have large ethnic Russian populations.

This would be a show-changer for the United States, as these nations are NATO members and, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, we are obligated to come to their aid if they are attacked. How such a war would look I address extensively in a publicly available document called Project 1721.

But it need not come to this. Putin can be stopped in Ukraine, and if he is stopped there, we will have averted a global war and given Europe another generation of peace.

"Now The Collusion Narrative Is Deflating, The Left Is Shifting Goalposts","Nate Silver, of all people, recently tweeted that the scale of Russian involvement in the 2016 election was quite small, and its effect was not visible. Silver is of course not a Russian agent, nor should this sentiment be out of place.

After all, it seems so obvious that it shouldn’t even need mentioning in analytical circles. But it’s not often that we see an otherwise shrill and religiously anti-Republican national publication write a normal analytical opinion. It’s a signal of the scaling down of the Russian influence narrative that has been pushed for the last two years.

NPR’s essay on Russia collusion being unproven was a surprise: “Prosecutors say that [Paul] Manafort shouldn’t get any consideration for the information he has given the feds because he has been lying to them; Manafort’s lawyers say he gave the government valuable information. Nonetheless, the crimes for which the feds want Manafort to be locked up aren’t a Russian conspiracy to throw the election.”

It was followed by The Nation, no right-wing MAGA hatters, with a thorough essay discussing the differences of the ones charged, the charges, and the original narrative of the collusion story. In an absurd irony, the piece notes how Manafort might go to jail for a “crime” of ostensibly tilting the Ukrainian government towards the European Union — weaning them away from Russia:

When it comes to his work in Ukraine, Manafort, as former Fusion GPS researcher Graham Stack writes, was convicted for ‘doing the opposite of colluding with Russia.’ In Ukraine, Manafort pushed a pro-Western agenda … Internal documents released by Mueller make clear that Manafort tried to steer his client, then – Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, to align with the European Union and away from Russia, or, in Manafort’s own words, promote ‘the key geopolitical messaging of how “Europe and the U.S. should not risk losing Ukraine to Russia.”‘

On former Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, the piece notes, “The only Russia-related criminal activity comes in Cohen’s lies to Congress about the effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, a failure that never got beyond a letter of intent.”

So, while Manafort and Cohen are guilty of several felonies like campaign finance misappropriation, or perjury, or even corruption, the “original sin” is still unsubstantiated. The article adds:

That Cohen was indicted for lying about a failed deal, but not for testifying that he never witnessed ‘any form of Russian collusion,’ should raise doubts that he has given Mueller anything on collusion. Mueller’s statement that Cohen gave ‘useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core’ to the Russia probe does not change that. The ambiguous wording could be interpreted either way — that information is deemed ‘useful’ does not tell us whether it is incriminating, exonerating, or neither.

This is fascinating. Ever since Trump won the election, there has been a sustained assertion in liberal sophisticate circles about active collusion between his campaign and the Russian FSB. From what we were made to believe initially, the First Directorate at the Lubyanka was active in infiltrating the random rubes across the West, had coordinated efforts with the incoming administration, and was grooming the prospective candidate as an agent of destruction of the United States.

From neocons who fled the Soviet Union and have an instinctive aversion to anything Russian, to British grifters and failed politicians, to PR agents of Georgian and Ukrainian government masquerading as information warfare experts, to social science academics looking to make a quick buck monetizing this hysteria, everyone sold the same narrative. That, eventually, slowly morphed into a new narrative that Russians were just “sowing confusion.” Now the final narrative is taking hold. It has nothing to do with Russia, and everything to do with Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigating corruption in the Trump campaign and administration.

Fair enough. The second point actually makes sense. Russians are not a friendly, allied power, and they never will be. Russia, like any other great power, even though it is materially declining, has a set of interests that will automatically, forever clash with those of the United Sates. That, added to the Russian sense of victimhood and betrayal, compels them to lash out and sow distrust.

Consider the Russian interference in what Russia considers to be Moscow’s sphere of influence. It is futile to imagine that Moscow would someday be an ally. That window has been shut off since 1993. However, it was also an idiotic threat inflation to imagine the current situation to be like the 1930s, to make Russia look like Nazi Germany, and to cast Trump as a fascist and Putin as the next Hitler. It leads to what I call the “Hyperbole Trap.”

For the sake of argument, if one accepts Putin to be the next Hitler, the rational counterargument would be to go to war against him — bog him down in quagmires and crush his forces to the last man. But to reach that level, one then needs to admit, for good or for bad, that men from Manchester, or Melbourne, or Massachusetts, need to fight and die for Mariupol, Ukraine.

Yet no one is making that argument. It’s always an argument for sanctions and “empowering civil society.” Hitler wasn’t defeated with sanctions. Likewise, if Brexit, French riots, and Trump leads to fascism across Euro-Atlantic, the logical argument would be to take up arms and go to civil war. Instead, there are passionate calls to vote out the fascist Brexiters or Trump. Which fascists, throughout history, were ever “voted out?”

The second irony is what Sohrab Ahmari pointed out in his latest column. Trump’s administration, despite its rhetoric, has actually been more aggressive than both his predecessors on Russia, he writes:

President Trump didn’t help with some of his gross rhetoric and refusal to criticize Vladimir Putin. But as a matter of policy, he has proved far tougher on Moscow than President Barack Obama. Trump has armed Ukraine, bombed Russian operatives in Syria and squeezed Putin’s clients in Tehran, among other things.

Again, this is not surprising, and I wrote about it in November 2016, right after Trump won: “It is unlikely that the United States, led by Trump, will suddenly renege on American security commitments and alliance structures overnight. Geopolitical reality, converging and overarching trans-Atlantic interests, and simple structural great power rivalry will not let that happen.”

Structure, and checks and balances of a system, more often than not triumph over individual agency. We don’t live in feudal times, when a king could decide on foreign policy based on personal whims and fancies. Anyone who has actually worked in foreign policy can vouch for that — at least anyone genuine, nuanced, and unbiased.

Russians are not allies, and I have written a whole paper on that. And there has been interference in Western societies by Russian intelligence. However, the sources of our problems of polarization and social distrust, whether in Europe or in the United States, are much deeper than that. The two simple but important questions to look for in the future are these.

One: Is or was there any direct collusion between Russian intel and the Trump admin (or, in our case, Brexiters)? Two: How much interference was there in American society through social media, which the left now wants to control? Also, what empirical evidence is there to show how much of that swayed the actual vote count in the election or the Brexit vote?

Conservatives in the United States should let the Mueller investigation answer these two specific questions, because that is all that matters. However, conservatives should be also wary of changing narratives and shifting goalposts, and the grifters trying to sell a used car. As an old saying goes from where I come, “No one wants to pet a spaniel after being promised a wolf.”

Russia Hysteria Proves Foreign Policy Establishment Is A Dumpster Fire,"Chuck Todd got his MSNBC pals together on “Meet the Press Daily” to have a serious, objective, and intellectual discussion of foreign policy and politics. Just kidding.

The Senate Intelligence Committee had just announced it found “no direct evidence” of collusion between President Trump and Russia. Democrats dispute this, without giving much reason why, which is a story in itself.

But Todd and his panel largely ignored that. They were laser-focused on former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort’s legal troubles, which is supposedly the next bombshell in the Russia investigation. Earlier this week, a federal judge found that Manafort lied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, breaking his plea agreement with Mueller’s team.

One of the things Manafort allegedly lied about was his interactions with his longtime business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national, while Manafort was Trump campaign chairman. That Manafort worked with Kilimnik for years is not news. Several years before his work on the Trump campaign, Manafort, along with many other D.C. types including connected Democrats, did a lot of work for Ukraine’s then Russia-backed government.

But Manafort’s meeting with Kilimnik is supposed to be nefarious. Manafort met Kilimnik on August 2, 2016, just weeks before Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign after it emerged that Manafort had long before received undisclosed money from Ukraine’s pro-Russia government. During the meeting with Kilimnik, Mueller’s team alleges that Manafort discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine with Kilimnik, which CNN said “could have had ramifications on U.S. sanctions against Russia.”

Now Manafort faces decades in prison for crimes including and stemming from not paying his taxes and not registering as a lobbyist for a foreign government, which occurred years before he joined the Trump campaign. But back to Todd’s panel.

Todd focused on the “importance of this meeting” with Kilimnik that occurred in a cigar bar. After painting the meeting as without-question nefarious with the help of “Former Senior FBI Official” Chuck Rosenberg, Todd pivoted to paint Trump as a Russian stooge:

Chuck Todd: You know, the other part of this [cigar bar meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik] was how President Trump as a candidate in that same period… August 2nd is the meeting… Here is Donald Trump on July 31st, obviously two days earlier on a Sunday show, being asked about Ukraine. Take a listen.

Then, a clip rolls of Trump’s interview with George Stephanopoulos on July 31, 2016:

Trump: That whole part of the world is a mess under Obama, with all the strength that you’re talking about, and all of the power of NATO and all of this, in the meantime he’s going away [Vladimir Putin] takes Crimea… George Stephanopoulos: But you said you might recognize that. Trump: I’m going to take a look at it, but you know the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia from what they were and you have to look at that also.

The flashback ends, and back at the MSNBC studio Todd asks the Washington Post’s Robert Costa, “Who would it be in telling Donald Trump, at the middle of July, that giving him that Kremlin talking point, that most of those people speak Russian? Was it Mike Flynn, was it Paul Manafort?”

Costa says it could have been either one. Then Chuck asks Evelyn Farkas—a “Former Pentagon Russia Expert” in the Obama administration—where Trump could have gotten such a talking point, because “nobody else was saying that… nobody in the foreign policy community was saying this?” Here, Todd is implying that Trump, unwitting or not, only could have gotten such a talking point from Russia.

Farkas answers: “If I remember correctly I was in Miami, and I was woken from my vacation revelry, because what he said was outrageous. The idea that he’s basically spouting the Russian line, the Russian propaganda about Crimea, saying ‘Well these people were Russian speakers and they wanted to be part of Russia.’ That’s irrelevant.”

Then Todd adds: “There are Spanish speakers in states in this country, does that mean they want to be part of Mexico?” Finally, Todd asks, “Was there any mainstream American foreign policy person pushing this” other than Manafort and Flynn?

Farkas says no, but adds that “Thankfully President Obama and all the western leaders and the United Nations as a whole said this will not stand.”

Our Foreign Policy Establishment Gets Nothing

From listening to Farkas, you would think Crimea was back in Ukrainian hands. Obama and foreign countries slapped sanctions on Russia, for goodness sakes! The real problem is that Farkas and Todd—and most of our country’s foreign policy establishment—don’t understand realpolitik.

Crimea had been part of Russia since 1783, when tsarist forces won it from the Ottoman Turks, until 1954. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev gifted Crimea from Soviet Russia to Soviet Ukraine—which, at the time, was essentially the same thing. The transfer was likely meant to reduce ethnic differences between the two Soviet entities, as Crimea’s Russian population could be added to Ukraine’s already sizeable Russian minority. So yes, Trump was factually correct, and it shouldn’t be Russian propaganda to point out Crimea’s Russian population.

Likewise, it isn’t being a Russia apologist to point out that Putin’s motivations at the time were largely driven by realpolitik, not an ethnically driven land grab. Russia has an important naval base in Crimea, which allows it to project power in the Black Sea, which is highly strategically important for Russia. Russia had leased the base from Ukraine until 2042, but the fall of Ukraine’s pro-Russia government in 2014—which Washington had at least something to do with—caused concern about Russia’s continued use of the base. So Putin snapped up Crimea that same year.

That doesn’t excuse Putin’s actions. But knowing the motivations of your opponent, and what he truly seeks, is an essential element to a successful foreign policy.

Don’t forget that when Trump was talking to Stephanopoulos, there was savage fighting in Ukraine, between forces loyal to the Ukraine government in the west and ethnic Russian forces being aided by Russia in the east. Although Trump would eventually send more help to the Ukrainians than Obama did, at the time Trump and many others were worried about America getting sucked into a war with Russia.

Right or wrong, Trump, the consummate deal maker, was surely eyeing ways to end the fighting in Ukraine without escalation—which is and was in America’s interest. As such, in Trump’s mind, it would be foolish to take the Crimea issue off the table.

Trump didn’t have to hear this from a campaign staffer who was somehow secretly connected to the Russians. This is common sense to average Americans, and certainly common sense to Trump. Basically everybody aside from the likes of the people on the MSNBC panel get this.

Likewise, it doesn’t justify Putin’s actions, or delegitimize agreed-upon international boundaries, to point out that the whole Ukraine issue is highly complicated, and America needs to tread lightly. America should have some very real concerns about propping up a corrupt and incompetent government in Kiev. It isn’t pro-Putin to point that out. Fundamentally, does America want to increase the risk of nuclear armed war with Russia over Crimea, or a chunk of eastern Ukraine?

You can’t deviate in any way from their approved mantras or they’ll get mad and call you a traitor. It almost sounds like a religion.

That’s why, at the very least, we should all be able to have a reasonable debate about these issues. But the public discourse is so poisoned by the likes of Todd, Farkas, and their MSNBC panel that a reasonable debate has long ago become impossible. The MSNBC foreign policy gurus think Trump is crazy, but they quite literally don’t know what they are talking about. They think that smart, nuanced foreign policy must be a sign of collusion. You can’t deviate in any way from their approved mantras or they’ll get mad and call you a traitor. It almost sounds like a religion.

By their standards, many of our foreign policy elite—and many Democrats—are colluding with China. And have been for decades. See how this works, and where this gets us?

That’s why our foreign policy establishment is the worst. They have bad ideas about just about everything, and are utterly unwilling to engage about their ideas in a civil manner. That often makes their ideas the only game in town, so that the problem is bipartisan. Sen. Mitch McConnell can’t find enough Senate votes for conservative causes, but he easily found 68 Senate votes to keep us in Afghanistan and Syria. But it’s a bad idea to stay in Syria. And we’ve been in Afghanistan for 18 years, and the situation on the ground isn’t getting any better.

To borrow from an old saying, five people picked at random out of a small-town USA phonebook would do better at foreign policy than that MSNBC panel, or much of our foreign policy establishment. Maybe we start to have a foreign policy that reflects what the people in the phonebook want?

You’ll Never Guess Who Is Trump’s Biggest Competitor For Putin Puppet,"In 2016, Paul Krugman famously dubbed Donald Trump “the Siberian Candidate,” alleging “indications that Mr. Trump would, in office, actually follow a pro-Putin foreign policy, at the expense of America’s allies and her own self-interest.”

Subsequent to his election, Trump’s detractors insisted that Trump, either voluntarily or under blackmail, has been acting as the cat’s paw of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has declined to criticize Putin publicly; has arguably undermined Euro-Atlantic solidarity by squabbling with America’s allies and labeling the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) obsolete; has seemed at times to accept Putin’s denials about Russian interference in U.S. elections, contradicting his own intelligence services; and has provided the Kremlin a windfall with his precipitous decision to pull U.S. ground forces out of Syria.

Trump’s unsuccessful business forays into Russia have been minutely examined for clues about his possible recruitment as a Russian agent, and his most suspiciously inclined critics have conjectured that Trump’s one-on-one meetings with Putin provide the venue for Trump to receive instructions from his Kremlin handler.

Such circumstantial evidence has been sufficient to convict Trump of treason in the court of liberal public opinion. Ominously, however, delirium Trumpens has blinded observers to a far more plausible and infinitely more destructive agent of Kremlin influence long active within the ranks of Western leaders.

The Migrant Crisis Was the Tipoff

In retrospect, the European Union migration crisis of 2015 should have been the tip-off. Faced with a crush of would-be immigrants clamoring for admission to Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gamely chose to throw the doors open. Wir schaffen das! (“We can do this!”) was her battle cry.

The baleful consequences quickly became manifest. The million-plus immigrants constitute a long-term underclass that will take generations to assimilate, if they ever do. Terrorist attacks emanating from this particular group of “refugees” have created, along with incidents like the mass public harassment of women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve 2015-16, a widespread public perception of heightened danger.

The immigration question has given an enormous impetus to the populist unrest roiling much of the European Union. It has sown enmity between those EU countries reluctant to resettle immigrants, and those states that consider the concept of burden-sharing to apply primarily to migrants rather than defense spending.

Did no one foresee the far-reaching tragic results of Merkel’s decision? Or did someone perhaps understand exactly what would transpire? Were the events of 2015, in fact, an intelligence operation of breathtaking audacity, setting in motion an insidious time-bomb for Europe under cover of an ostensibly humanitarian gesture? One can visualize Putin grinning malevolently and muttering “Wir schaffen das!” with a very different das in mind.

European security provides another highly instructive indicator. Trump has been roundly criticized for denigrating NATO, and while it was an error to label the Euro-Atlantic alliance obsolete, Trump actually wasn’t far off the mark. The problem is not that the alliance is obsolete, but that its European military component has been allowed to grow obsolescent. No country is more responsible for this deplorable state of affairs than Merkel’s Germany.

Which Western leader, then, has done greater damage to NATO? The one who has honestly called out the alliance’s shortcomings and demanded a more responsible approach from European partners, or the one who has quietly, complacently allowed her military to slide into senescence? Need we ask Putin which policy he prefers?

Consider the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline

The overriding humanitarian impulse that opened the immigration floodgates in 2015 is curiously absent from Merkel’s policies toward Ukraine. Economically, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that Merkel champions is a scheme to divert several billion dollars annually from indigent, embattled Ukraine to a consortium of well-heeled European energy companies. Politically, Nord Stream 2 would lay the groundwork for wider Russian aggression against Ukraine by freeing Moscow to launch a military campaign without jeopardizing the vital revenue from Russian gas exports that currently transit Ukraine.

In short, Merkel appears determined to safeguard Russia’s hydrocarbon revenues and maximize European dependence on Russian gas while opening up a veritable second front against Ukraine. Several years ago, a senior politician from one of the Baltic States characterized Russian policy toward his region by quipping that “Molotov is looking for his Ribbentrop.” But perhaps Molotov has already found her?

Putin’s putative American stooge, by contrast, has repeatedly denounced Nord Stream 2, threatened sanctions against companies that participate in the project, and undercut Russian hydrocarbon revenues more broadly by spurring on U.S. energy production. Trump also ignored Merkel’s longstanding objections by providing lethal military assistance to Ukraine.

Moreover, in the Balkans, the Trump administration has endorsed the concept of a voluntary land swap between Serbia and Kosovo. Merkel has rejected the idea of a territorial swap, which, among other things, would seriously undercut Russian leverage in the Balkans. Coincidence?

If Meetings Are a Pretext, Merkel’s Got Those Too

If Trump’s few, brief unchaperoned encounters with Putin have generated speculation about the U.S. president receiving his marching orders from his Russian counterpart, then what are we to make of Merkel’s lengthier and more frequent têtes-à-têtes with the German-speaking Putin? One might well suspect that she needs additional face time with Putin in order to receive more fulsome and detailed instructions.

Trump has been condemned for his failure to criticize Putin publicly. By contrast, Merkel has denounced Putin as—well, come to think of it, what has she said about the man? Has she ever used expressions like “KGB thug,” “the Evil Kremlin Dwarf,” or any of the other terms of endearment for the Russian president currently popular in Western parlance? Not to my knowledge. Does this reticence not give rise to suspicion?

Astonishingly, no one seems to have looked into the possibility that Merkel was recruited as an agent by none other than Putin himself. It is no accident, as the saying goes, that Merkel hails from the former East Germany. That’s precisely where Putin earned his spurs as a KGB agent in the run-up to the fall of the Berlin Wall. No doubt a careful reconstruction of their movements in the fateful years from 1985-89 would identify multiple occasions when they were “coincidentally” together in the same city, and her recruitment by Putin can thereby be logically presumed.

Moreover, Merkel certainly knew people in East Germany who knew other people who in turn knew Putin. Identify these connections, and the strings binding the marionette to the puppet-master have been established. There is surely enough material here to keep a small army of special prosecutors and investigative journalists gainfully employed for many years. What are the reporters waiting for? Forget about Trump’s tax returns—has anyone seen Merkel’s Stasi file?

It’s the Perfect Cover, You Have to Admit

“Preposterous!” some might cry. “Angela Merkel is a pillar of the Liberal World Order, while Trump is a bumptious parvenu and an enemy of everything we hold dear!”

But that’s precisely the point! How else could Putin insinuate his super-agent into our midst and deftly elevate her to presumptive leadership of the Free World, except by having her embrace our values publicly while persistently destroying, with a quiet determination that draws no attention to itself, the very foundations of the West?

Think about it—raging discord in the EU, the functional debilitation of NATO, the undermining of Ukraine. Who would do such things, and why? And after all, whom would a master spy like Putin entrust with so delicate and fraught a mission—the swaggering, loud-mouthed Trump, or the discreet, tight-lipped Merkel?

Whom, indeed? If we would but allow the scales of prejudice to drop from our eyes, the answer is staring us in the face.

Top Obama WH Lawyer Charged With Lying About Foreign Collusion,"A federal grand jury on Thursday charged Greg Craig with conspiring to hide his paid collusion with a foreign government and lying about that work to federal officials. Craig, a high-powered Beltway lawyer, served as President Barack Obama’s top White House lawyer during the former president’s first year in office.

According to the formal indictment of Craig, which the Department of Justice released Thursday afternoon, the Democrat superlawyer “did unlawfully, knowingly, and willfully falsify, conceal, and cover up” his work on behalf of the Ukrainian government.

“The purpose of the scheme was for CRAIG to avoid registration as an agent of Ukraine,” the indictment alleges. “Registration would require disclosure of the fact that” an unnamed Ukrainian had “paid CRAIG and the Law Firm more than $4 million[.]”

The indictment alleges that Craig cooked up a scheme to avoid registering as a foreign agent, as required by the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), after he was hired to run interference on behalf of the controversial politically charged prosecution of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenka. In exchange for $4 million, Greg was expected to produce a report showing that the prosecution accorded with Western legal standards and was not tainted by corruption, the indictment alleges.

Instead of properly disclosing the amount of the payment and the terms of the contract, Craig allegedly drew up paperwork that falsely claimed his compensation would only be $12,000.

“The engagement letter omitted any mention of the amount of money CRAIG would be paid or the source of that money,” the indictment claims. “CRAIG’s letter did not disclose that he and the Law Firm would be paid more than $4 million for their services and that the money would be paid by the Private Ukrainian.”

Craig deliberately hid the true nature and compensation of his work for Ukraine in order to maximize the public relations value of the report he wrote for the Eastern European government, according to the indictment.

The FARA law requires disclosure and registration of work done on behalf of foreign governments or principals by anyone who “acts within the United States as a public relations counsel, publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such foreign principal[.]” The law further defines a “public relations counsel” as “any person who engages directly or indirectly in informing, advising, or in any way representing a principal in any public relations matter pertaining to political or public interests, policies, or relations” on behalf of a foreign government or principal.

The indictment alleges that, in addition to concealing his foreign agent work from the government, Craig also lied to his law firm about it and falsely claimed that he had no contact with the media about the report he had prepared. Based on his statements, the law firm filed false statements about its public relations contacts to the Department of Justice.

Craig “knowingly and willfully caused to be made false statements of material fact in documents filed with and furnished to the Attorney General,” the indictment alleges. “[D]uring an interview conducted by the Special Counsel’s office, CRAIG repeated certain of the false and misleading statements he made to the FARA Unit concerning the timing and nature of his contacts with journalists about the Report.”

The case against Craig stemmed from the wide-ranging probe overseen by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The indictment even alleges that several of Craig’s false statements were made during interviews conducted by Mueller’s investigative team. While Mueller charged multiple Trump affiliates — such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn — with false statements charges, he chose not to charge a prominent Democrat attorney who worked in the Obama White House with any wrongdoing. It is not clear why Mueller prosecuted alleged violations by Trump associates but not of a former high-ranking Obama administration official.

Instead, the charges were announced by federal prosecutors within the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Craig is the first former Democrat official to be charged in connection with the Mueller probe.

If convicted, Craig could face up to ten years in prison. The full indictment can be read here.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/11/obamas-top-white-house-lawyer-indicted-for-concealing-lying-about-foreign-collusion/,2019-04-11
7 Ways The Mueller Report Exposed The Media’s Fake ‘Bombshell’ Stories,"After two and a half years of countless mainstream media “scoops” and “bombshells” that turned out to be false or nonexistent, the American people finally have some concrete answers on Russiagate. When Special Counsel Robert Mueller released his 448-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 election on Thursday, some of the investigation’s conclusions debunked once and for all many misleading, and anonymously sourced, conspiracy theories.

Here are some of the most prominent stories the press got wrong about the Russian collusion narrative.

1. Michael Cohen Never Went To Prague

The infamous Christopher Steele dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, alleged that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with Federation Council foreign affairs head Konstantin Kosachev in Prague. Desperately wanting to confirm this, news outlets sent reporters to hotels all over Prague checking hotel logs.

In April 2018, McClatchy reported Mueller had obtained evidence of Cohen’s visit to the Czech Republic, according to two anonymous sources. In December 2018, they reported that Cohen’s cell phone, or a device registered to him, was pinged off towers near Prague.

The Mueller report debunked this piece of the dossier once and for all when the special counsel wrote, “Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.” McClatchy has now added a two sentence editor’s note to their two reports on Cohen.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Robert Mueller’s report to the attorney general states that Mr. Cohen was not in Prague. It is silent on whether the investigation received evidence that Mr. Cohen’s phone pinged in or near Prague, as McClatchy reported.

2. Carter Page Was Not a Russian Agent

Carter Page was the main link between the Trump campaign and Russia. He was a one-time foreign policy adviser on the Trump campaign, has spent time in Russia, and has many contacts with the foreign adversary. The dubious Steele dossier alleged that Page held secret meetings with allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trips to Moscow.

These connections are perhaps the only evidence presented by the media who were convinced Page was a Russian spy (and the only evidence used by the FBI to seek a surveillance warrant against Page, but I digress).

Mueller finally put this myth to rest in his report, asserting they found no evidence Page coordinated with Russia on behalf of the Trump campaign.

Russian intelligence officials had formed relationships with Page in 2008 and 2013 and Russian officials may have focused on Page in 2016 because of his affiliation with the Campaign. However, the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

3. Donald Trump Did Not Direct Cohen to Lie to Congress

In January 2019, BuzzFeed News dropped what was supposed to be “bombshell” report, alleging that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress about a potential real estate deal in Moscow. They also reported that Mueller’s office had evidence of these alleged lies.

The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.

In February, Cohen told Congress under oath that the president never directed him to lie, and now the Mueller report is confirming the contrary report as false:

Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony.

4. Cohen’s Call With a Russian Did Not Prove Collusion

In November 2018, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes reported on live television that “The President was compromised by a hostile foreign government, full stop.” Hayes proposed this was the only conclusion to take from Cohen’s admission that he lied to Congress.

The Mueller report investigated Cohen’s phone call with a personal assistant to a Russian official, and found no evidence that they ever followed up or acted on that initial phone call about a Trump Tower in Moscow.

“Cohen could not recall any direct follow-up from Poliakova or from any other representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct follow-up,” the Mueller report concluded.

5. Paul Manafort Was Not Funneling Polling Data to Putin

Many reporters used Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s past business dealings in Russia to prove he was a Russian stooge, but one reporter, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo, was particularly confident that Manafort’s activities proved collusion on the Trump campaign once and for all.

These new revelations combined with earlier reports effectively end the debate about whether there was ‘collusion’ between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. There was. It wasn’t marginal. It was happening at the very top of the campaign. The campaign manager was secretly funneling campaign data and information to a Russian oligarch closely tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin…

The Mueller report thoroughly debunked the theory that Manafort was sharing polling data with Putin in order to win the election.

The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort’s sharing polling data and Russia’s interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

6. The Trump Campaign Did Not Make Republicans Soften Their Position on Ukraine

MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow passionately presented her theory that in 2016, before the Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign convinced Republicans to soften their policy positions on Russia, and to abandon advocating for supplying Ukraine with weapons to fight off Russian invasion.

“We definitely do have evidence that the Trump campaign was working to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue,” Maddow said.

The Mueller report debunked this conspiracy theory outright:

The investigation did not establish that one Campaign official’s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia.

7. Jeff Sessions Was Not a Russian Spy

The Washington Post reported a “big scoop” in March 2017, alleging that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russians and lied about it in his confirmation hearing. They reported that, as a Senator, Sessions had a private meeting in his office with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“The previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia’s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election,” the Post wrote.

They also reported that Sessions and Kislyak met and talked at an event, which turned out to be a Heritage Foundation event that included 50 other ambassadors in the room.

The Mueller report states that the special counsel investigated Kislyak’s encounters with both Sessions and members of the Trump campaign, and found neither to be evidence of collusion. He wrote that Kislyak’s interactions with Trump campaign officials were “brief, public, and non-substantive,” and that Kislyak and Sessions’s meeting in the Senator’s office discussed nothing “more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.”

These are just a few of the truths finally unearthed in the aftermath of Russiagate. At this point, the damage these media outlets have done to their own credibility may be beyond repair.

"Before The U.S. Makes Any Moves On Ukraine, It Needs A Strategy","What is the British and American grand strategy in Ukraine? What do we really want from that region? Is it to push Russia away from the European balance of power? Is it to arm every single state that is adversarial to Russia, so they can bog Russian forces down and drive up the cost? Is it the duty of only the British and American taxpayers, or should the Europeans be more responsible for their own security? What is the ultimate endgame?

If we go by two recent reports, the answers to those questions are as confusing as they come. On one hand, the United States wants to ease Ukraine’s dependency on Russian gas and energy resources. Rick Perry, the current U.S. energy secretary, said in Warsaw after meeting officials from Poland and Ukraine that the United States wants to ease the dependence on Russian energy and Russian coercion.

The Polish and Ukrainians agree, of course, and the reason is purely material. Poland and Ukraine want to buy American liquified natural gas (LNG), which will cut down Russian coercion and influence. Germany, on the other hand, wants to have Russian gas. Naturally, a geopolitical stalemate is certain.

The second instance is the Trump administration rethinking a $250 million weapons aid to Ukraine. According to Politico, “President Donald Trump asked his national security team to review the funding program, known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, in order to ensure the money is being used in the best interest of the United States.”

It is again a valid question, as $250 million is a hefty sum of cash to be spent on weapons to Ukraine, without even knowing where the money is going or what the endgame is. For those unaware, the security initiative is a program primarily by the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, to transfer nonlethal equipment, deploy advisers to assist with a reform of the Ukrainian defense forces, and provide training to selected Ukrainian units.

Interestingly, once again, the countries that actually border Ukraine, especially Germany, are reluctant to arm or train Ukrainians. In the recent G7, the rift was clearer, with French President Emmanuel Macron planning a detente with Moscow, and the Germans refusing it.

If Russia Loses Ukraine, It Ceases to Be a Great Power

To understand the situation, one needs to understand why Ukraine is more important to Russia than it is to the United States, and will always be. Recently in the Kerch Strait, Russian navy rammed, fired upon, and then seized three Ukrainian patrol boats. It was a sudden spike of tension after a year of relative calm and sporadic violence in the embattled Eastern Ukraine.

The Kerch Strait is the gateway to this landlocked water that borders Ukraine and Russia. Russia’s fundamental aim is to have control of the entire water, which gives the Russian navy a free ride as it de facto controls Eastern Ukraine as well as the Crimean Peninsula. The reason is geopolitical.

Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the greatest grand strategists of modern times, wrote in one of his last books about why Ukraine is pivotal in the grand chessboard of Europe. According to Brzezinski, Ukraine is the breadbasket of Europe and the strategic focal point. To put simply, without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a European great power, or even a great power at all.

Research suggests Eastern Ukraine is invaluable to Russia because Russian military depends on the Ukrainian military industrial complex. This is not just about Crimea, or the Sevastopol naval base, which gives Russia a foothold in the Black Sea. This is about the industries in Mariupol and next to Donbas, which provides supplies from jet engines to missile parts to naval radars for the Russian forces.

Ukraine’s accession to the European Union would stop two things. Ukraine being attached to the European security umbrella would mean Ukraine not being able to trade with Russia on military parts, and without those spares and upgrades, Russian armed forces would be paralyzed. Ukraine as part of a new security architecture would also mean regular military ties with Russia would be cancelled. Ukraine is also a market of Russian products, especially food, which would be stopped if Ukraine cedes sovereignty to the EU and Russian products do not pass EU customs checks.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin might have underestimated the divisions within Ukraine. Ukraine isn’t as tiny as Georgia. And Russian armed forces know that while they would be able to win any war with Ukraine, keeping control of the huge land is another story altogether.

Other than Eastern Ukraine, Russians don’t enjoy popular support. The historical legacy of Ukraine’s suffering under Joseph Stalin is too strong. Ukrainians are extremely nationalist ever since World War I. And the American experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya should give any great power a pause about sending an occupying force for a long time, and risk a withering war of attrition. It is unlikely that Russia, alone and with an economy smaller than Italy, is intending for that.

The West Must Determine an Endgame

Other than that, the Russian strategy seems pretty straightforward. Russia’s intention is to stop Ukraine from joining NATO or the EU. NATO wouldn’t accept any country where a war is going on, which is going to be a security burden. EU won’t accept any country that isn’t whole or democratic. The war in Eastern Ukraine will stop both and result in a status quo, which will continue in Russian favor and result in a new fait accompli, which will be hard to break.

But what is the endgame on this side? At this point, it is neither engagement nor containment, and there is a huge difference in opinion within the West as to what we need to do. It is unlikely that anyone from Michigan, U.S., or Manchester, U.K., or Manitoba, Canada, or Melbourne, Australia, wants to die defending Mariupol, Ukraine. America, Britain, and others simply do not face the threat from Russia that the Soviet Union used to be, and Ukraine is simply not that strategically important.

Second, the combined manpower of EU is five times that of Russia, and the combined GDP of the EU is 15 times higher than Moscow. Yet on security burden, Europe is happy to pass the buck to the rest of the Anglosphere.

Ukraine is already receiving arms, and that would continue as NATO rearms and positions brigades in Eastern Europe, resulting in the security dilemma and spiral increasing. Also, any conflict has a momentum of its own and would continue to spiral regardless of who wants it. Single renegade commanders, rogue agents, a mistimed naval war, and a serious lack of communication might lead to a situation in which there would be another land war in Europe. That is not a future anyone should want.

But what needs to be decided is a clear strategy and endgame. If the endgame is to push Russia out of the European balance, then that should be stated clearly, and offensive weapons that raise Russian casualties in Ukraine and Georgia should be contemplated. Alongside, Europeans must do more to deter Russia and share the security burden.

If the strategy is to engage Moscow and let it have its sphere of influence while focusing on China, then that should be stated as well. In that case, all arms sales should be stopped and a detente should be initiated, meaning also that Europeans should be coerced, under Macron if needed, to start the process and take more burden.

Either way, the West needs to choose a strategy depending on the final aim and the endgame. So far, it is not clear there is one, either in London or in Washington.

Is Hysteria Over Whistleblower A Distraction From Biden’s Ukraine Policy?,"President Trump has come under fire for a whistleblower complaint that alleges the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky to work with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in a July phone call. Much of the coverage of the whistleblower complaint has focused upon Trump’s potential impropriety. Some Democrats, such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), have hysterically claimed that impeachment may be the only answer to Trump’s refusal to make the complaint and phone call transcript public.

This framing leaves out a few key pieces of information that, if included, would paint a vastly different picture. For instance, buried halfway through this CNN article is the fact that the complaint, filed with the intelligence inspector general, was deemed by the administration to have failed to meet the reporting requirements of the intelligence whistleblower law.

Why? Because the complaint was based on hearsay. According to an official briefed on the matter, the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications.” Instead, the information in the complaint apparently came from “learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work.” This fact is why, despite the inspector general signing off the complaint as “urgent and credible,” the director of national intelligence did not forward the complaint to Congress.

Furthermore, much of the discussion of the whistleblower complaint has centered on amplifying and condemning Trump’s behavior without much mention of what Joe Biden’s son was doing in Ukraine. There’s a pervasive attitude among those in the media and on the left that if Trump improperly requested an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter, the impropriety of the request somehow makes the potential behavior of Hunter Biden and his father acceptable. This reaction is incoherent and bizarre.

In an ep-ed on Saturday, Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer provided a lengthy walkthrough of Hunter’s activity in Ukraine and his father’s potential role in shielding him from an investigation by the Ukrainian government.

In April 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, which had been struggling to adopt a more transparent model of operation after the removal of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych. It’s worth noting that Hunter had no experience within the energy sector, but was paid as much as $50,000 per month for his work at Burisma. His presence on the board was seen as a way for the company to legitimize its Western pivot. As the New York Times reported:

Their [Hunter Biden and others’] support allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans at a time when Ukraine was especially dependent on aid and strategic backing from the United States and its allies, according to people who worked in Ukraine at the time.

At the time Hunter joined the board, his father was overseeing the White House’s Ukraine policy, and Burisma was embroiled in controversy. The British government had put a temporary freeze on the London accounts of Burisma’s owner, which was later lifted due to “lack of cooperation from the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor who preceded Mr. Shokin.” Additionally and more importantly, the Ukrainian government was launching its own investigation into potential corruption at the company.

In early 2016, then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s controversial prosecutor general who was overseeing the investigation into Burisma. Biden had made firing Shokin part of his anti-corruption crusade, a move even back in 2015 the New York Times had expressed some skepticism over, given Hunter’s role at Burisma.

In a 2018 speech, Joe Biden confirmed his pressure campaign, which involved withholding U.S. loans from the Ukraine if Shokin was not fired: “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b—-. He got fired.” Later interviews with half-dozen senior Ukrainian officials reveal the pressure campaign spanned months.

Shokin was fired in March 2016. The investigation into Burisma was dropped six months later. The case was later reopened in 2018 with a new prosecutor. In written answers to Hill contributor John Solomon, former prosecutor Shokin acknowledged he had developed “specific plans” for the Burisma investigation, “include[ing] interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”

It would be hard for then-Vice President Biden to not have known about Hunter’s role at Burisma or about Shokin’s role in the investigation when he had the prosecutor fired. Not only was Hunter’s new position reported by the New York Times in 2014, Biden’s office even went on record in 2015 after being questioned about Hunter’s ties, the New York Times reporting that “Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the vice president, said Hunter Biden’s business dealings had no impact on his father’s policy positions in connection with Ukraine.”

It also doesn’t help that, according to an interview in July with The New Yorker, Hunter admitted to discussing his Burisma involvement briefly with his father once, making Joe Biden’s recent vehement denial to ever having it discussed it that much odder.

On Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” expressing that he would support an investigation of Joe Biden if evidence were to reveal that the 2020 Democratic rival had improperly interfered in a Ukrainian investigation in order to shield his son from potential charges. “I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,” Pompeo said.

Given the incessant calls for impeaching Trump since his election, it seems many on the left are banking on the hope that the public and media will focus on Trump’s impropriety rather than on the possibility that Biden used his diplomatic position to shield his son from investigation. As Politico points out, ginning up hysteria against Trump may end up backfiring on Biden, who will be forced to relitigate an issue that only hurt his image during the Obama years.

As the New York Times editorial board wrote in 2015, “It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father’s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.”

Best-case scenario, it’s just bad imaging that Joe Biden had the prosecutor investigating his son’s company fired. Worst case scenario, Biden leveraged his position as vice president in grossly unseemly ways. In either case, to pretend that such relationships aren’t worthy of investigation because Trump suggested they were is a farce. It’s worth getting to the bottom of the whistleblower’s hearsay that prompted Trump’s requests.

If done “correctly,” the left’s hysteria about the phone call will conveniently shield Joe Biden from inevitable criticism regarding his past Ukraine policy, should he win the nomination. But if not, the call may just revive ethical questions regarding Joe Biden’s role in U.S.-Ukraine relations, concerns he likely had long hoped to put to rest.

"Like Russian Collusion, Ukraine Hysteria Is Projection By Dems, Media","If the latest media-manufactured hysteria over President Donald Trump’s interactions with the Ukrainian government looks familiar, it’s because it is. The same tired playbook is being run by the same discredited people with the same goal: get rid of Trump, by any means necessary.

Just as the Clinton campaign, Obama administration holdovers, and complicit media allies peddled lies about Russian collusion while engaging in literal Russian collusion during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, so too did Joseph Biden literally threaten to withhold money from Ukraine if it failed to fire the prosecutor investigating his son’s company.

To hear the media tell it, Trump committed treason. The walls are closing in. The end is nigh. Why? Well, the details there are a little fuzzy, as they always seem to be. Somebody heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another that Trump had threatened Ukraine that it must investigate Hunter Biden, the troubled son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden…or else.

The media initially hyped their latest faux scandal by claiming a deeply connected “whistleblower” listened to a phone call between Trump and the head of Ukraine’s government, in which Trump allegedly threatened to withhold money if the Eastern European nation failed to investigate allegations of corruption by Hunter Biden. Then it morphed into the source reading a transcript or readout of the phone call. And eventually it was buried in the 22nd paragraph of a breathless CNN story that the alleged “whistleblower” hadn’t in fact directly read or seen or heard anything he or she was allegedly blowing the whistle on:

The whistleblower didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower’s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration’s determination that the complaint didn’t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

There’s burying the lede, and then there’s fitting the lede for cement boots, pushing it down an elevator shaft into a pool of bullets, and then tossing the remains overboard somewhere over the Marianas Trench. CNN opted for the latter. One man’s “whistleblower” is apparently another man’s rumor-monger or anonymous gossip columnist. The Wall Street Journal later disclosed that there was no quid pro quo and no discussion of U.S. financial aid during the call the whistleblower cum axe-grinder never even heard.

On Sunday, Trump did admit that he raised the topic of Biden and his son Hunter with the Ukrainian president within the context of needing to root out corruption in Ukraine, which raises all sorts of questions Democrats and their media allies would desperately like to avoid, such as: did Hunter Biden have sketchy business dealings in Ukraine? Did he benefit financially from those arrangements? Were any Ukrainian companies he worked for being investigated? Did his father, as the vice president of the United States, personally intervene to shut down Ukrainian officials who were investigating Hunter Biden’s Ukrainian business arrangements?

The answer to all those questions is a resounding YES. Despite being kicked out of the Navy for cocaine abuse and having no demonstrable business acumen, Hunter Biden nonetheless in 2014 landed a $50,000 per month gig on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian oil and gas concern.

Coincidentally, the law firm that helped arrange the sinecure, Boies Schiller, previously hired Fusion GPS, the shady opposition research firm retained by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee to concoct the Russian collusion hoax, to run interference for Theranos, the infamous fake blood testing company whose founder was charged with wire fraud.

When Burisma later attracted the attention of Ukrainian law enforcement, Joe Biden personally intervened to make sure Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor looking into the company’s finances, was fired. You don’t have to take my word for this, because Joe Biden bragged about his efforts to fire the prosecutor investigating the company that paid Hunter Biden a $50,000 per month sinecure. On camera. In detail. Last year (the specific statement from Biden begins at 52:20 in the video):

And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t. So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.

Well, then.

The similarities between the anti-Trump Russian collusion operation and the fledgling anti-Trump Ukraine operation are eerie. If not for the utter implosion of the Russian collusion nonsense, culminating in a two-year special counsel investigation run by anti-Trump partisans that nonetheless found zero collusion, the Ukraine operation might almost be believable.

The thinly sourced rumors, the bombshell evidence that was always just around the next corner, the hyperventilating media coverage, the demands for ever more invasive investigative enemas from left-wing lawmakers like Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the fact that the alleged crimes were all committed not by Trump, but by his political opponents. If we hadn’t already been shown this same movie over and over and over again for three years, it might actually be interesting.

Instead, it’s just another manufactured narrative peddled by partisans desperate to prevent anyone from shining a spotlight on their own shenanigans. Just as the Russian collusion conspiracy begins and ends with Hillary Clinton, the Ukraine corruption scandal begins and ends with Joe and Hunter Biden. And just as they did with the investigation of the Russia hoax, their media allies will do everything in their power to make sure that evidence never sees the light of day.

NeverTrumper Suggests Trump Should Be Executed For Ukraine Call,"Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, doubled down on comments Monday that the president could face execution over asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to root out corruption.

“Governor Weld, you went a little bit further than just impeachment in your prior comments,” MSNBC political analyst Elise Jordan pressed Weld. “You’ve said that Donald Trump has committed treason, and the penalty for treason under American law is death… What’s the legal framework here? Have you looked into this? How do you see this proceeding?”

Weld affirmed his stance and falsely said again that “the only penalty for treason is death,” adding that he believes Trump needs to be “carted off to save us all.”

“He’s daring us all to let him be totally lawless,” Weld said. “He has no respect for the law, he doesn’t understand the law. He has no knowledge base under any issues. Why do we want this man as president of the United States? I don’t get it, and now the path is clear.”

Weld’s claim that treason is only punishable by death is untrue. According to 18 U.S. Code § 2381, treason is punishable by either death or imprisonment of at least five years.

The president has been under heightened scrutiny for a phone call with the Ukrainian president where Trump reportedly asked the foreign leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter over business dealings with a Ukrainian gas company, according to an uncorroborated claim based on hearsay.

Weld is one of three candidates challenging Trump in the 2020 Republican primary. Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford and former one-term Illinois congressman Joe Walsh have both also launched campaigns seeking the GOP nomination next fall.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/23/nevertrump-candidate-suggests-trump-should-be-executed-over-ukraine-call/,2019-09-23
Watch Biden Brag About Bribing Ukraine To Fire Investigator Of Son's Biz,"The media has had a field day over new hearsay accusations that President Trump was wrong to ask Ukranian leaders to investigate political corruption related to Joe Biden. Predictably, several House Democrats have used this news cycle to again demand Trump’s impeachment.

While the whistleblower complaint is based on hearsay, we do know that Joe Biden, while serving as vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor who was investigating his son’s company. Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian national gas company Burisma in 2014 while his father was managing the United States’ Ukraine policy and despite zero personal experience in the field. At the time Hunter Biden joined its board, Burisma was embroiled in allegations of corruption, allegations serious enough that Ukraine’s prosecutor general launched an investigation into the company.

Joe Biden was so proud of his role in the prosecutor’s removal from investigating the company paying his son $50,000 per month merely to serve on its board that he actually bragged about it in a 2018 speech at an event for the publication Foreign Affairs. In this speech, Biden boasts his threat to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans from Ukraine if they did not agree to fire the prosecutor who happened to be investigating the company giving his son a cushy sinecure.

The prosecutor was fired, and the investigation was dropped six months later. While the investigation was just reopened last year, it has been a slow-moving process that has turned up little. At the time Biden pushed for the firing of Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general, Shokin had plans to question Hunter Biden.

Watch Biden brag about his role in having the prosecutor fired below:

﻿

The relevant portion of the speech is transcribed below.

I remember going over and convincing our team, others, to convince that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.

So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.

CNN Cut 540 Words To Frame Trump For 'Favor' He Never Requested,"In the media’s efforts to tie President Donald Trump with its latest conspiracy theory, CNN skipped an entire section of the released and unredacted transcript of a phone call to charge Trump with requesting a favor he never asked for.

Below is text from the transcript of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of the latest media outrage cycle.

I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… the server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you and your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

The transcript that CNN read on air, however, connects the word “favor” in this section with Trump 540 words later asking the Ukrainian leader to look into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s questionable business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company. Hunter sat on the board of the company for $50,000 a month while, as Joe Biden bragged in 2018 on camera, his dad put pressure on the Ukrainian government to end a corruption probe into the company.

CNN just skipped right over it on air earlier this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/1cirnrMglW — Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) September 25, 2019

Here’s the transcript has reported by CNN: “I would like you to do us a favor… There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.”

MSNBC’s Katy Tur made the same omission.

“Will you do me a favor and investigate Vice President Biden’s son? Will you do me a favor and get involved in the 2020 election? Vice President Biden is my chief political opponent,” Tur said.

National Public Radio (NPR) also skipped over more than 500 words of the transcript to tie “favor” to the later part of the conversation mentioning Biden, all to suggest Trump demanded foreign meddling in the U.S. election.

The stunning omissions come as Democrats are jumping on an uncorroborated complaint from an anonymous “whistleblower” alleging Trump urged the Ukrainian president to investigate American political opponents. The White House released the fully unredacted version of the July phone call in question today. It contradicted the complaint, revealing no quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government as the hearsay accusations claimed.

The intelligence inspector general had rated the hearsay complaint “credible” and “urgent,” but other agencies refused to move them up the legal food chain due to lack of supporting evidence.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/cnn-just-yadda-yadda-yaddad-540-words-to-frame-trump-for-favor-he-never-requested/,2019-09-25
Democrats Asked Ukraine To Investigate Trump In 2018,"While Democrats rush toward impeachment over an anonymous whistleblower complaint accusing President Donald Trump of requesting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, many have ignored the fact that last year, Senate Democrats wrote to Ukraine’s prosecutor general asking Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump.

In May of 2018, Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko asking the Ukraine government to keep four investigations open related to the Mueller probe into Russian election interference in the U.S. and indicated that their support for foreign aid to Ukraine could be in jeopardy.

“As strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine, we believe that our cooperation should extend to such legal matters,” the senators wrote, adding that they were “disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these principles in order to avoid the ire of President Trump.”

Durbin, one of the letter’s authors, has now come out in support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s opening of an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Leahy and Menendez have both called for an investigation into the president’s alleged misconduct related to Ukraine.

The White House has come under heightened scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers and political opponents after an uncorroborated complaint was filed by a whistleblower accusing the president of conspiring with Zelensky to impede the campaign of Joe Biden, who is the 2020 Democratic front-runner. The complaint was deemed “credible” and “urgent” by the intelligence inspector general despite the whistleblower admitting having no firsthand knowledge of the conversations between the two world leaders in question.

Some Democrats who were previously opposed to impeachment, however, have now supported the start of official proceedings, including Pelosi, who endorsed impeachment Tuesday with the announcement of an official inquiry the House has not yet voted on.

On Wednesday, an unclassified and unredacted transcript of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky was released revealing no quid pro quo offered by Trump regarding his request that the Ukraine leader look into Biden’s son, Hunter, for shady business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company where Biden, as vice president, “stopped the prosecution” into the company, the board of which Hunter sat on for $50,000 a month.

The transcript shows Zelensky first bringing up the issue of political corruption in Ukraine, followed by Trump suggesting that Ukraine authorities investigate their country’s own involvement in the Russian collusion conspiracy that suggested the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016, which after a three-year probe turned out to be demonstrably false.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/democrats-asked-ukraine-to-investigate-trump-in-2018/,2019-09-25
DOJ: Bureaucrat’s Trump Complaint Was Neither Urgent Nor Needing Congressional Referral,"The Department of Justice’s criminal division reviewed a bureaucrat’s complaint about President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and found it neither urgent nor requiring referral to congressional committees. All relevant components of the department agreed with the legal conclusion, and the matter was concluded, a DOJ spokesman announced.

The complaint was leaked to the media and other Democratic officials who have used it to call for the immediate impeachment of President Trump. A transcript of the call was released to the public. In the wide-ranging phone call, the transcript shows the two leaders discussing Ukraine’s meddling on behalf of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, which the Justice Department today confirmed is now being investigated by a team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

The Ukrainian president asked that former New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani, who is the president’s attorney, come to Ukraine. “We are hoping very much that Mr. Guiliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine,” Zelensky said.

The legal opinion rests mostly on the idea of whether the foreign policy role of the president of the United States is subject to unelected bureaucrats’ complaints. It is not, they found.

A complaint from an intelligence-community employee about statements made by the President during a telephone call with a foreign leader does not involve an “urgent concern,” as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3033(k)(5)(G), because the alleged conduct does not relate to “the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity” under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence. As a result, the statute does not require the Director to transmit the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees.

The investigation also found that the complainant had political bias in favor of an election opponent of President Trump, though that had no bearing on the DOJ decision.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/doj-bureaucrats-trump-complaint-was-neither-urgent-nor-needing-congressional-referral/,2019-09-25
GOP Politicians Aren’t Falling For Ukraine Hysteria Like They Did Russia,"Unlike how they handled the Russia collusion conspiracy theory, Republican politicians have shown themselves less likely to fall for the Ukraine story being peddled through leaks to the same sympathetic reporters from anonymous partisan sources.

On Sunday, CNN’s Jake Tapper amplified a tweet from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, with some additional commentary:

First GOP official I’ve seen to even stray in the general direction of possibly thinking of approaching condemnation — https://t.co/2VdvP9SVEG — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 22, 2019

In recent days, Resistance figures have run an operation similar to the Russia collusion conspiracy that gripped the country for years. That since-debunked conspiracy theory, supported by daily drips of “bombshell” “news” reports from media employees including Tapper, was that Trump had seditiously colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. Even the partisan probe ostensibly led by the ailing Robert Mueller was unable to find a single American, much less the president of the United States, had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. The hysteria about Russia caused real harm to the country’s foreign policy and administration of government. No one has yet been held accountable for perpetrating the hoax. And many media are helping the co-conspirators in the hoax avoid that accountability.

Now similar figures are alleging, based on an anonymous source without firsthand knowledge, that Trump should be impeached because of a phone call he had with Ukraine in which corruption involving Hunter Biden was discussed. Biden is the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. He is famously troubled, but also acquired a great deal of wealth thanks to his father’s connections, including in Ukraine and China. The anonymously sourced reports are changing, depending on the media outlet. First it was a whistleblower, then it turned out to be a hearsayer — someone without firsthand information. Supposedly a quid pro quo was demanded, then it turned out there was no quid pro quo. President Trump, for his part, is adamant that the phone call was nothing as described, even as that description is ever-changing.

Trump released the transcript of the phone call, which showed that the media and other Resistance figures’ early reports of the call mischaracterized it. Last week, it might be noted, Democrats were demanding the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh due to a false report in the New York Times of dubious provenance to begin with.

What Tapper highlighted is worth highlighting, though. While during the Russia hoax, nearly all prominent Republicans expressed concern about collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election, rushed to microphones to condemn the president for what turned out to be a false smear of sedition, and went out of their way to protect the relentless investigation of him based on lies secretly funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, this time, it’s mostly just Mitt Romney.

The standard of evidence required from Resistance figures in and out of the media to perpetrate yet another Russiagate is so high that it might be impossible to meet. But at the very least, it’s higher than what’s offered now. Yes, Democrats have wanted to impeach Donald Trump for the crime of winning the 2016 election, and they very well might do that no matter what they pretend the underlying reason is. But Republican politicians, Romney and those like him excepted, are either smart enough not to fall for this particular Resistance effort, or they’re simply savvy enough to realize there is no appetite for Republican politicians to assist Democrats in undermining a duly elected Republican president based on questionable hearsay, a complicated narrative that doesn’t even add up, and a desperate desire to undo 2016.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/gop-politicians-arent-falling-for-ukraine-hysteria-like-they-did-russia/,2019-09-25
"Impeachment Would Be Really Stupid, But Democrats Will Do It Anyway","House Democrats’ most edge towards impeachment proceedings reveals that their fanatical hatred of President Trump, which has driven much of their agenda over the past two and a half years, has not abated in the slightest.

On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the House will move forward with an “impeachment inquiry” into President Trump due to allegations that he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate corruption charges against 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. However, the latest calls for impeachment may end up hurting Democrats’ chances of recapturing the White House in 2020.

Impeachment is a mistake for two reasons: impeachment is generally an unpopular endeavor and Joe Biden will be the one to suffer if Trump’s phone call with Ukraine, the alleged basis for this current round of impeachment calls, is investigated to the fullest extent.

Historically, the unpopularity of impeachment is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it’s often regarded as a form of political “trauma,” under which the nation should only be subjected in extreme cases. Instead, over the past three years Democrats have abused the seriousness of the process, treating impeachment discussions as a form of cathartic therapy to cope with their candidate’s loss in 2016. The fact that they are pushing for impeachment on the basis of hearsay before any transcript of the phone call has been released evinces this very point.

Removing a president from office requires both a majority in the House to impeach and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict. Given the current breakdown of the Senate, a minimum of 20 Republican senators would have to vote to convict, and it is highly unlikely that Democrats will be able to convince Republicans to vote for removal when currently the entire basis of the allegations is hearsay. Thus, if the Democrats do opt to go forward with impeachment, the process is unlikely to amount to much more than a show trial.

Thus, beyond failing to advance the removal of Trump, what the supposed “impeachment inquiry” likely will do is relitigate something the Democrats’ current 2020 frontrunner had probably hoped to put to rest.

Despite the left’s attempts to focus the hysteria on the allegations, there is plenty amiss about Joe Biden’s involvement in Ukraine, events that are genuinely worthy of investigation. While serving as vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general, who was then investigating the natural gas company paying Biden’s son as much as $55,000 per month to sit on its board. Biden can be seen here bragging about his role in having the prosecutor removed.

In an era in which the left perpetually accuses Trump of corruption and nepotism, it would be an uncomfortable endeavor for the ;eft to explain how Biden’s desire to fire Ukraine’s top prosecutor had nothing to do with the fact that the prosecutor was investigating his son’s company.

Pelosi’s launching of the impeachment inquiry into Trump seems to offer nothing promising to Democrats. Indeed, as NPR reporter Tim Mak tweeted, none of the Democratic lawmakers he confronted were able to offer a consistent answer about what launching an “impeachment inquiry” would mean, aside from more aggressive efforts to impeach that fall short of actually filing for impeachment.

If Democrats do go forward with impeachment, they are taking an incredible risk, and they know it, which is why they are not actually proceeding to impeachment right now but instead bluffing about an “impeachment inquiry.” Right now, according to Real Clear Politics, Joe Biden is not only the Democratic frontrunner but also enjoys a lead of nearly 10 points over his current primary competitor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.), when polls are averaged.

Biden has been polling as the candidate most able to beat Trump in the general election. Thus, as Democrats push for impeachment proceedings against Trump on the basis of the Ukraine phone call, what they are really advocating for is a full-blown investigation of arguably their most electable candidate.

Despite the limited gains to be had from impeachment beyond the momentary ego boost, the Democrats may very well take the plunge. They have driven their base into such hysterics that anything less than impeachment will seem like capitulation and therefore, will be deemed unacceptable. But it won’t be Trump who bears the brunt of the blowback from possible impeachment. It will be Democrats.

Trump Asked Ukraine President To Help With DOJ Probe Of 2016 Election Interference,"In a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump asked the new leader to assist the United States in its ongoing investigation of foreign interference in the 2016 elections. The Department of Justice confirmed today that it is investigating Ukraine’s involvement in 2016 election meddling.

“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”

Prior to the release of the transcript, media and other Democrats misrepresented the phone call as an abuse of office. It is unclear how a United States president attempting to get to the bottom of foreign interference in democratic U.S. elections constitutes an abuse of power, as many Democrats have alleged in recent days. The focus on the phone call comes ahead of the much-anticipated release of an Inspector General report on political spying abuses by the Obama administration as well as declassification of materials expected to detail efforts to spy on the Obama administration’s political opponents using false information.

While the media have largely ignored Ukraine’s outsize role in election meddling in 2016, a Politico article headlined “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire” details the efforts former officials made to support Hillary Clinton in her campaign against Donald Trump. Much of the so-called Russia scandal involves political players in Ukraine, including Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Christopher Steele, the author of the debunked “dossier” alleging a grand conspiracy of collusion between Trump and Russia. Steele was secretly funded through cutouts by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

While it is unclear specifically what Trump was referring to with Crowdstrike, the company founded by a Russian-born businessman was tapped by the Democratic National Committee, which funded the Steele dossier, to examine its servers after they were hacked during the 2016 campaign. The company alleged that Russian actors had hacked the server.

Crowdstrike was forced to revise and retract “statements it used to buttress claims of Russian hacking during last year’s American presidential election campaign” after it was accused of misrepresenting data. Some cybersecurity experts strongly questioned its unequivocal claims regarding Russian hacking. Its report on Ukrainian artillery losses was widely circulated in the media before it was revised and retracted.

The Department of Justice confirmed today that Ukraine’s role in 2016 election meddling is being investigated and that some Ukrainians are already cooperating with the probe. “A Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “While the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/trump-asked-ukraine-president-to-help-with-doj-probe-of-2016-election-interference/,2019-09-25
Ukrainian President Asked Trump To Dispatch Rudy Giuliani To Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked President Donald Trump to dispatch Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to share information with the country’s leadership, according to a transcript of the phone call reviewed by The Federalist.

The transcript of the phone call between the two world leaders, which took place July 25, 2019, began with Trump congratulating Zelensky on his party’s victory in parliamentary elections. The two men discussed ways to work together on energy independence, how to increase European Union support of Ukraine, and ways to cooperate to restrain Russia, specifically via sanctions.

Zelensky first raised the issue of rooting out corruption in Ukraine and said he wanted to “drain the swamp” in his country given the long history of political and corporate corruption there. He mentioned to Trump that he had recently called Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. and planned to replace the official with “a very competent and very experienced ambassador.” Zelensky then told Trump that he was “hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.”

Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Ukraine’s involvement in the Russian collusion hoax operation during and after the 2016 election in the U.S.

“I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine,” Trump said, according to a review of the transcript of the phone call. “They say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it.”

“I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said.

The Department of Justice confirmed today that it is investigating the role of Ukrainian and other countries’ officials in foreign interference in the U.S. elections in 2016.

“A Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. She added that while Attorney General William Barr has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered their cooperation with Durham.

Joe Biden and his son Hunter were mentioned only one time during the call, when Trump noted that the former vice president had “stopped the prosecution” involving a Ukrainian energy company that reportedly paid Hunter Biden $50,000 a month to sit on its board.

At no point did Trump tie any U.S. financial aid to Ukraine for investigations of Hunter Biden’s controversial business activities in the country, a review of the transcript shows.

While reports from anonymous bureaucrats leaking to the media suggested that Trump had tied disbursement of taxpayer funds to a personal favor, the transcript instead showed Zelensky affirming his gratitude to the United States for its support of the Ukrainian economy relative to its own neighbors, including strong support for Russian sanctions. The United States is a “bigger partner than the European Union … especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russia Federation,” Zelensky told Trump.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/25/ukrainian-president-asked-trump-to-dispatch-rudy-giuliani-to-ukraine/,2019-09-25
Adam Schiff Invents Transcript Of Trump Call With Ukraine President,"The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., made up his own version of a transcript between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart to fit the false narrative being peddled by Democrats and many in the media to frame the president for a crime that never happened.

In his opening statement at a congressional hearing featuring acting Department of National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire, Schiff gave a fictional retelling of the conversation between the two leaders.

In opening statement, Rep. Schiff makes up dialogue to represent what Trump said to Zelensky. A rough transcript of the president's words exists, and is available, but Schiff's version is more dramatic. pic.twitter.com/f7gS4KIPge — Byron York (@ByronYork) September 26, 2019

Here is what Schiff said:

And what is the President’s response — well it reads like a classic organized crime shake down. In essence, what the President Trump communicates is this: We’ve been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what, I don’t see much reciprocity here. You know what I mean? I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you though. And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of dirt, on this and on that. I’m going to put you in touch with people, and not just any people. I’m going to put you in touch with the Attorney General of the United States — my Attorney General, Bill Barr — he’s got the whole weight of American law enforcement behind him. And I’m going to put you in touch with Rudy, you’re going to love him. Trust me. You know what I’m asking, so I’m only going to say this a few more times, in a few more ways. And don’t call me again. I’ll call you when you’ve done what I asked.

The actual transcript says no such thing. The “favor” in question was Trump seeking assistance with the Department of Justice’s probe into the 2016 election meddling by Ukraine. On the phone call, Trump later suggested that Ukrainian officials look into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter for their shady business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company to root out corruption in the European country. While overseeing the administration’s policy toward Ukraine, then-Vice President Biden played a role in firing the Ukrainian prosecutor going after the Ukraine company whose board Hunter sat on for $50,000 a month despite no prior experience working in the industry.

Later in the hearing, Schiff admitted that his fictional account of the transcript was a “parody.”

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody,” Schiff tried to clarify. “Of course the president never said if I — if you don’t understand me, I’ll say it seven more times.”

Democrats and many in the media, however, have pushed a narrative that seeks to charge Trump with conspiring with a foreign leader to meddle in the next U.S. presidential election, mirroring false claims made three years ago when the president was accused of colluding with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Blatant Media Lies About Trump-Ukraine Non-Scandal Are Never-Ending,"The entire news cycle this week has revolved around one thing: President Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine. The problem is, this story sounds all too familiar.

The media propped up a story about Trump-Russia collusion and prolonged a false narrative over the course of three years. The “story” ended with the Mueller report, which proved absolutely no collusion.

Now the mainstream media is running with a new narrative, one that claims Trump directly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.

Having learned nothing from 2016, the media are deliberately spreading misinformation, just as they did with the Trump-Russia story. It’s time to straighten this out.

1. Based on the Transcript, There Is No Clear ‘Quid Pro Quo’

The media are running with the idea that there is a clear quid pro quo.

“This really looks like evidence of a damning quid pro quo,” Vox writer Zack Beauchamp wrote.

CNN hopped on the train as well, saying:

The transcript of a July phone call between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky amounts to a clear case of a (barely) unspoken quid pro quo involving the digging up of dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

“Quid pro quo” has become a buzz word when discussing this story, but what does it actually mean? Essentially, it means asking for a favor with the expectation that something will be returned. Was that actually what happened, according to the transcript? No.

2. In Order to Impeach Trump, a Clear Quid Pro Quo Is Needed

NBC News, however, does not believe a clear quid pro quo is needed to successfully impeach Trump.

The law is very clear that a quid pro quo need not be explicit for a crime to have taken place. It can be inferred from the facts as a whole. Even if there was no quid pro quo (no withholding of military aid, in this case), Giuliani was clearly acting on behalf of Trump’s campaign in seeking to persuade Ukraine to “investigate” the Bidens. Federal law prohibits a foreign national from directly or indirectly making a “contribution or donation of money or other thing of value” in connection with a U.S. election, and prohibits a person from soliciting, accepting or receiving such a contribution or donation from a foreign national. Damaging information about a political opponent could fit within this definition, meaning Trump and Giuliani solicited an illegal “thing of value” from a foreign national in connection with an election.

What this NBC author deceptively left out was that this isn’t just a “federal law,” it’s the “contributions and donations by foreign nationals” law. The word “thing,” means a tangible item or donation. This isn’t some overarching federal law. It’s a law about contributions, donations, and other tangible items.

Information in no way falls into these parameters, contrary to this NBC reporter’s claims.

3. Biden Was Not Mentioned Eight Times During the Ukraine Call

According to the transcript, Biden was mentioned three times — twice in the same sentence and once in the following sentence.

The transcript reads:

The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General that would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Yet prior to the release of the transcript, the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post both claimed Trump mentioned Biden’s name eight times.

4. The Acting Director of National Intelligence Never Threatened To Resign

The headline for the Washington Post article read, “Acting director of national intelligence threatened to resign if he couldn’t speak freely before Congress on whistleblower complaint.”

According to the Washington Post’s own story, an unidentified official told the Post that Joseph Maguire threatened to resign if he wasn’t able to speak freely before Congress. But in the next paragraph, Maguire denies ever having said that.

“At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16 2019,” Maguire said. “I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”

The direct source denying he wants to resign is a better source than an unidentified “official.” But that doesn’t fit the media’s narrative.

5. Trump Did Not Ask the Ukrainian President To Investigate Biden as a ‘Favor’

The word “favor” came some 540-odd words before Biden’s name was ever mentioned. Yet the mainstream media is reporting directly that Trump asked Zelenksy to do him a favor by investigating Biden.

The “favor” Trump asked for was for Ukraine to investigate Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity company. Some 540 words later, Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden’s interference with a Ukrainian prosecutor, not as a favor the way the media are portraying it to be.

Gossip-Ridden 'Whistleblower' Complaint Follows Steele Dossier Template,"The formal complaint from an anti-Trump “whistleblower” alleging various crimes by President Donald Trump is riddled with third-hand gossip and outright falsehoods. The document was declassified by Trump Wednesday evening and released to the public Thursday morning. The complaint, which was delivered to the chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees, follows the same template used in the infamous and debunked Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier.

Rather than provide direct evidence that was witnessed or obtained firsthand by the complainant, the document instead combines gossip from various anonymous individuals, public media reports, and blatant misstatements of fact and law in service of a narrative that is directly contradicted by underlying facts. A footnote in the document even boasts about its use of “ample open-source information.”

Contrary to news reports asserting that the complaint included volumes of information incriminating Trump, it is instead based entirely on the president’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and various public media reports.

“I was not a direct witness to most of the events” characterized in the document, the complainant confesses on the first page. Instead, the complainant notes, the document is based on conversations with “more than half a dozen U.S. officials.” Those officials are not named, and their positions are not identified anywhere in the letter.

The complainant begins by falsely characterizing a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, the transcript of which was released by the White House on Wednesday.

Trump made a “specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike,” the complainant alleges. A review of the transcript of the call shows that while Trump mentioned Crowdstrike once during the call, he never made such a request about locating and turning over multiple servers to the U.S.

The complainant also falsely alleges that Trump told Zelensky that he should keep the current prosecutor general at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, in his current position in the country.

“The President also praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep him in his position,” the complainant alleges, based on gossip he says he heard from unnamed White House officials.

Trump made no such suggestion to Zelensky, according to the transcript of the phone call. While Trump did say that it was “unfair” that a prosecutor who was “very good” was “shut down,” it’s not clear that Trump was even referring to Lutsenko, as a previous prosecutor named Viktor Shokin was fired after he opened investigations into a Ukrainian energy company that placed Hunter Biden, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, on its board.

Trump directly references Shokin later in the conversation.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,” Trump said.

In 2018, Joe Biden bragged on camera that his threats to withhold a billion dollars in loan guarantees from Ukraine directly led to Shokin’s firing.

The complainant then alleges, without evidence, that efforts to secure the records of the call to prevent unauthorized access to classified information are themselves proof of corruption.

The transcript was “loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,” the complainant claims. “One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.”

The complainant provides zero evidence beyond the opinion of an anonymous official that phone conversations between world leaders do not contain “anything remotely sensitive.” Trump formally declassified the transcript of the phone call, which had previously been classified as “SECRET/NOFORN,” meaning the information could not be shared with uncleared U.S. individuals or any foreign nationals, earlier this week.

In a footnote, the complainant even alleges that the mere classification of phone calls between world leaders was itself a corrupt act.

Following the section on Trump’s phone call with Zelensky, the complainant then devotes several pages to summaries of various news articles as proof of the underlying allegations in the complaint. The complainant quotes George Stephanopoulos (an ABC News employee who previously served in President Bill Clinton’s White House), The Hill, Bloomberg News, Politico, Fox News, the New York Times, and even Twitter.

The document itself is riddled not with evidence directly viewed by the complainant, but repeated references to what anonymous officials allegedly told the complainant: “I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials,” “officials have informed me,” “officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me,” “the White House officials who told me this information,” “I was told by White House officials,” “the officials I spoke with,” “I was told that a State Department official,” “I learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “One White House official described this act,” “Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me,” “I also learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “The U.S. officials characterized this meeting,” “multiple U.S. officials told me,” “I learned from U.S. officials,” “I also learned from a U.S. official,” “several U.S. officials told me,” “I heard from multiple U.S. officials,” and “multiple U.S. officials told me.”

A review of the entire complaint shows it is not so much an example of whistle-blowing, an act that can only be done by the individual holding the whistle, but an elaborate gossipy game of telephone between unnamed individuals whose motives and credibility are impossible to ascertain.

In fact, the Department of Justice (DOJ) found in its review of the complaint from the anonymous official that the intelligence community inspector general found “indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate.”

“The complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community,” the DOJ legal opinion noted. “Rather, the complaint arises out of a confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received secondhand.”

DOJ officials determined that the complaint was statutorily deficient since the president is an independent constitutional officer who is not subordinate to unelected intelligence agency bureaucrats. The DOJ opinion also determined that the complaint, which was based almost entirely on hearsay, was not “urgent” as required by statute and therefore not required to be submitted to congressional intelligence committees.

Warren Doesn’t Know If Her Ethics Plan Would Bar Hunter Biden Situation,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) appeared flustered Wednesday when asked whether her ethics proposal unveiled this month would prohibit her vice president’s son from serving on the board of a foreign company, as was the case under President Barack Obama.

“Could you say whether or not, under a Warren administration, would your vice president’s child be allowed to serve on the board of a foreign company?” asked a reporter following the Massachusetts senator’s speech at a New Hampshire rally.

“No,” Warren initially answered. Then she backtracked. “I don’t know. I mean I’d have to go back and look at the details.”

The far-left senator branding herself as the maven of comprehensive proposals released a plan dealing with Washington corruption earlier this month. She’s making a play for rival 2020 White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) supporters and picking up momentum.

Warren said she was uncertain, however, whether her new proposal would bar the situation that occurred during the Obama administration: Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for $50,000 a month despite having no prior experience in the industry. Meanwhile the vice president was managing the administration’s Ukraine policy and pressured the Ukraine government to end a corruption probe into the company.

Warren rolled out her corruption plan with announcing the Working Families Party’s endorsement during one of the largest speeches of her campaign to date, speaking to an estimated audience of 20,000 people gathered in New York City’s Washington Square Park last week. The endorsement from the Working Families Party, an openly socialist group connected to Communists, struck a blow to Sanders because the organization backed the Vermont senator’s presidential bid in 2016.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/26/elizabeth-warren-doesnt-know-if-bidens-corruption-would-violate-her-ethics-plan/,2019-09-26
How The House Plans To Use Its ‘Inquiry’ To Instigate Impeachment,"Exhibit A in the upcoming impeachment proceedings, if you believe Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), is this transcript of a phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. Anyone capable of passing a middle school civics test already knows an “impeachment inquiry” of the kind Democrats have announced is only step one in the process.

In a Senate with 47 non-Republicans, the “get Trump” forces must convince 20 Republican senators to vote to expel the president for a House impeachment effort to succeed. This is because Article I of the Constitution requires that two-thirds of senators vote to convict to expel the president. If all 100 senators are present, 67 must vote to get rid of Trump. This seems impossible based upon the current state of affairs.

So what is behind the coordinated media and Democrat campaign to drum up an “impeachment inquiry”? In one 24-hour period, the media rolled out the same Trump-Ukraine story with the same angle and often the same talking points within the same few hours on CNN, the Intelligencer, The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Guardian, Vox, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Beast, to name a few examples.

More tellingly, the phrase “in plain sight” appears over and over again in the supposedly independent media outlets that, in theory, wrote the articles at the same time, making it difficult or impossible for them to have directly copied from each other. Google search results bury the first dissenting coverage near the bottom of the second page. Of course they’re colluding with each other and coordinating with Democrats, but that’s another article for a different day.

To understand the significance of an “impeachment inquiry,” we need to go back to a blitz of document requests that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrod Nadler sent in March 2019. Nadler sent requests to a withering list of 81 government officials, citizens, corporations, and probably a few zoo animals and cartoon characters. Each included a “schedule” of requested documents designed to burden and harass each of the unlucky recipients. The one to the White House requested a huge list of document categories, including any documents furnished to the special counsel team.

Since at least March, Nadler and other House Democrats have engaged in a public fight with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to force the House into a formal impeachment proceeding. Rep. Ro Khanna explained Nadler’s strategy: “What happens next is dependent on the courts. If the courts rule against the administration and the administration defies a court order, then I think it is a full-blown crisis.”

Congress’s authority to request documents is dependent on whether it has a legitimate legislative purpose for the documents. The purpose of the House invoking the phrase “impeachment inquiry” is to create a pretext to argue in court that it has a right to the documents.

The White House brushed off many of Nadler’s requests in this May 15, 2019 letter denying the requests because Nadler had “not articulated any proper legislative purpose” for pursuing matters already investigated by Robert Mueller, for example. Because impeachment is one of the enumerated functions of the House, document requests relevant to an “impeachment inquiry” might be able to overcome this objection.

The strategy of declaring an “impeachment inquiry” actually has little or nothing to do with a serious effort to put a case in front of the Senate based upon existing wrongdoing. Rather, it calls to mind the technique used to snare so many victims of the get Trump movement: the process crime. Democrats want to force the president into defying a court order upholding a House document request in order to meet the Khanna test for a full-blown impeachment proceeding.

As noted by the Los Angeles Times, the full House voted to initiate an impeachment inquiry against presidents Nixon and Clinton. This comes in contrast to what the Democrats are now attempting to do by announcing an impeachment inquiry without a full House vote. The absence of a declaration by the full House sets up the argument for the president that this “inquiry” is a mere political stunt by a rogue committee and not a legitimate legislative purpose endorsed by the full House.

Quick-to-panic Washington Examiner editor Phil Klein has posited that the Ukraine transcript is not a dud, but bad news for Trump. He says this because of president’s mention of all the help the United States has given Ukraine immediately before bringing up Joe Biden. Recall, Biden bragged on video about threatening to withhold aid from Ukraine until it fired the prosecutor who was investigating his son’s Ukranian company.

Klein seems to be saying that if the president asks Ukraine for information about Biden abusing his authority to protect his son, that’s a crime. Klein is buying the post-Trump rule that anything done to help Trump is a crime.

Thus, Klein, for some reason, says it’s no problem when Biden holds up U.S. aid to have his son’s investogator fired. But when a sitting U.S. president demands accountability for that misconduct, that’s a crime. And by potentially holding up U.S. aid to get to the bottom of that corrupt behavior, well, that makes it an impeachable offense.

It’s another blatant shoe-on-the-other-foot example that exposes the complete corruption of the rule of law in the get-Trump era. Trump is the constitutional master of the prosecutorial function within the executive branch, and he is well within his authority to insist upon an investigation, even if it involves a political opponent.

And yes, he also has every right to withhold aid from a foreign country if necessary to obtain information needed for the investigation. That’s a legitimate public interest. In contrast to the Trump/Russia collusion hoax, in this case Trump has made himself politically accountable to the decision and it is based upon a videoed confession by Joe Biden himself.

One final observation about this being bad for Biden: One thing that Trump has proven in the last five years is that bad media publicity has a way of helping the target in a primary contest because it starves his competitors of attention. You likely have no memory of what Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders did this week because of the Ukraine story. If the media thought they would get a two-for by kneecapping Biden and Trump in the same scandal, they may find a double boomerang instead.

It’s High Time To Reassess The United States’ Relationship With Ukraine,"Washington’s relationship with Ukraine has become the latest football in America’s partisan politics. Democrats charge that the Trump administration illegitimately put a new military aid package to Kiev on hold, using it as leverage to pressure Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to include in his investigation of the previous government’s notorious corruption the activities of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son.

The younger Biden had a lucrative post on the board of directors of a large Ukrainian natural gas company with close ties to that government. President Trump vehemently denies the allegation that he was improperly trying to coerce Kiev into harassing the Bidens. Zelensky’s administration emphasizes that it wants to stay out of America’s bitter political warfare.

Largely lost in all the partisan maneuvering and bickering is a more important issue: the nature of Washington’s overall relationship with Ukraine and whether that relationship really serves America’s best interests. To examine that issue it is important to overcome an especially tenacious foreign policy myth: that Trump has engaged in an appeasement policy toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The appeasement accusation was an integral part of the “Russia collusion” narrative that not even the politically biased staff of former special counsel Robert Mueller could substantiate.

The reality is that the Trump administration’s Russia policy has been noticeably more uncompromising and confrontational than the approach Barack Obama adopted, and nowhere is that aspect more evident than with respect to Ukraine. It may not be a wise policy, but it is decidedly hardline.

Despite explicit congressional authorizations, Obama refused to sell arms to Kiev, believing (with good reason) that such a step would exacerbate already serious Ukrainian-Russian tensions, and even more worrisome, exacerbate U.S.-Russian tensions. Conversely, the Trump administration approved two major arms sales to Ukraine during its first two years. The latter sale in the spring of 2018 even included Javelin anti-tank missiles.

The new arms package that Trump temporarily delayed was the third such measure to provide significant arms aid to Kiev. Since Moscow backs a secessionist war in eastern Ukraine and has been on bad terms overall with Kiev since demonstrators ousted the elected, pro-Russian government in 2014, the U.S. policy of boosting Ukraine’s military capabilities is hardly a friendly act.

The arms sales are not the only indications of a significant escalation of Washington’s support for Kiev under the Trump administration. Secretary of Defense James Mattis admitted that Washington had adopted a program to train Ukrainian troops at a military base in western Ukraine.

One dramatic exception to the recent shrill partisanship surrounding Trump’s alleged use of the latest arms deal for nefarious purposes is the attitude regarding the appropriateness of the sale itself. There is a bipartisan consensus in Congress that selling weapons to Ukraine is a good move that benefits America’s security interests. But that assumption reflects poor judgment by both the executive and legislative branches.

Americans should ask themselves why Ukraine is now an essential security interest of the United States warranting Washington meddling in a civil war and adopting measures certain to antagonize Russia. Clearly, Ukraine was never a U.S. security interest of any sort during the Cold War, given that it was an integral part of the Soviet Union. Merely because it became independent is not a sufficient reason that a country deep inside Eastern Europe, directly on Russia’s border, should now be an American security client. Yet that is what has occurred.

For some members of the U.S. political and foreign policy establishments, even the current cozy bilateral security relationship with Kiev is not enough. President George W. Bush strongly lobbied the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to offer Ukraine (along with Georgia) membership in the alliance. At the 2008 NATO summit, Bush pressed for a Membership Action Plan, the first stage of the process leading to admission.

Key European allies, led by France and Germany, balked for two reasons. First, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Ukraine was a dysfunctional mess in domestic politics and policies. Second, both Paris and Berlin feared that admitting Ukraine or Georgia would lead to serious trouble with Russia.

Those NATO members seem no more enthusiastic today about having a treaty obligation to defend Ukraine and Georgia than they did in 2008. Indeed, they seem anxious for an agreement between Moscow and Kiev ending the violent standoff over eastern Ukraine’s secession. Zelensky’s government has expressed worry that the West, especially Paris and Berlin, will pressure Kiev to make major concessions to Moscow to achieve that goal.

At the same time, enthusiasts in the United States continue to press for NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia. Given the conflicting tends on the two sides of the Atlantic, the United States could find itself trying to protect its de facto Ukrainian client from Russian coercion when even its principal NATO allies have no stomach for such a mission. Indeed, comprehensive public opinion surveys in European countries show little willingness to fulfill mutual defense obligations to other current NATO members, much less to nonmembers on Russia’s frontier.

Washington’s entire Ukraine policy fairly cries out for a comprehensive reassessment. Unfortunately, the shallow partisan posturing over Trump’s latest actions provides little hope that such a meaningful reassessment will occur anytime soon.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/26/its-high-time-to-reassess-the-united-states-relationship-with-ukraine/,2019-09-26
"NYT, WaPo Front Pages Slice Ukraine Call Transcript To Implicate Trump","The New York Times and the Washington Post selectively cut up the transcript of a July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the newspapers’ front pages to fit each paper’s misleading headline accusing Trump of requesting a favor that he never asked.

“Trump offered Justice’s aid for a probe of Biden,” reads the Washington Post front page.

“Trump asked for ‘favor in call, memo shows,” blares The New York Times.

Each paper prominently displays selectively edited passages of the transcript between the two leaders below the primary headlines, each omitting key text that shows each statement to be demonstrably false.

Accurate context is seen below in more of the transcript. It undermines the misleading headlines from the two newspapers. The elipses (…) are original to the transcript. This full text was left un-highlighted in the Times and completely off-page in the Post:

I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… the server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you and your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

As the transcript shows, the “favor” in question was Trump seeking help with the Department of Justice’s probe into 2016 election meddling by Ukraine. Nowhere in the fully unclassified and unredacted transcript does it show Trump either demanding that Ukraine investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as a favor or any offer of quid pro quo.

In fact, Trump’s later mention of the prosecutor who was fired seems to also relate to the two president’s larger discussion of rooting out political corruption. Zelensky notes that the previous Ukranian ambassador to the United States under his political opponent was “bad,” and that the previous Ukranian administration did not support U.S. interests. Trump responds:

Good because you had a prosecutor who was very good and was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.

When Zelensky and Trump discuss this specific prosecutor, they make zero mention of any “quid pro quo,” of Trump using U.S. aid or other things Ukraine wants as a bargaining chip. Yet the Washington Post and New York Times selectively cut the transcript to make it appear as if that is the case.

Several other mainstream media organizations made the same stunning omission Wednesday in their reporting of the declassified transcript. CNN, MSNBC, and NPR all glossed over more than 500 words of the transcript and several different topics discussed to connect the word “favor” to Trump’s suggestion for Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens for their dealings with a Ukrainian energy company to weed out corruption in their country.

In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company. He made $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry, all while his father managed U.S. policy on Ukraine as vice president. Joe Biden later bragged about playing a role in firing the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Hunter’s company with an explicit quid pro quo of $1 billion in withheld U.S. aid if the Ukranian government did not comply.

The focus in the media however, have not centered on the Bidens’ shady dealings with Ukraine but on an anonymous “whistleblower” complaint that was based on hearsay accusing Trump of conspiring with the Ukrainian president to investigate his political opponent. The charges mirror false allegations made three years ago accusing Trump of working with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016, which, after three years of wall-to-wall coverage and a costly probe by a special counsel, were shown to be nothing more than a conspiracy theory.

4 Reasons The Ukraine Call Is No Watergate,"House Democrats have moved a step closer toward impeaching the president, and their friends in the media are excited at the prospect. Part of that is the ratings bonanza that would follow an impeachment as Americans are compelled to watch the news they would usually rather avoid. But another part is their sense that at last, they’ve caught President Trump in something that will lead to his downfall.

But if you turn off Twitter and talk to people in your neighborhood, it doesn’t quite feel that momentous. In significant ways, the accusations against Trump differ from Bill Clinton’s impeachment and Richard Nixon’s almost-impeachment. The legal implications of Trump’s phone call to the Ukrainian president are still being hashed out, but there are several points in Trump’s favor in terms of the public perception about the charges.

1. Where’s the Cover-Up?

As a people, we have heard the Watergate-era phrase “it’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up” so often that we’ve internalized it. “What did the president know and when did he know it?” was the signature inquiry of that investigation, with the assumption being that Nixon did, at some point, know of the Watergate break-in and then worked to conceal that fact.

Likewise, Clinton’s resistance to the Kenneth Starr investigation suggested he had something to hide. The same could even be said of Trump’s reaction to Robert Mueller’s questions earlier in his term.

Unlike in Nixon’s third-rate burglary or Clinton’s philandering, though, there is no cover-up here, or at least there doesn’t appear to be. Faced with accusations about a phone call, Trump released the whole transcript within a couple of days. He’s not covering up a thing.

The people can judge for themselves what happened and act accordingly. Had Trump stonewalled, it would have looked worse and people would have naturally suspected more serious misdeeds. Transparency was the smart move here, especially since judging by the transcript, there’s not much to see.

All of this hinges, of course, on the people believing the transcript. That’s not a guarantee. Even before it was released, journalists on the left raised questions about its authenticity. Had it shown an explicit quid pro quo or some other law-breaking, those doubts would have been dispelled, but now that we know that transcript shows no such thing—and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agrees—the conspiracy theorists will stick to their suspicions. Transcript truthers are even now getting their stories straight.

2. No Conspiracy

In Watergate, there was a general perception of a conspiracy. That was not as true as Nixon’s enemies made it seem—the administration was more haphazard than that, recent biographies have shown—but the public saw the president then as a man who planned ahead, like a responsible world leader. He wouldn’t just send of G. Gordon Liddy and his gang on a whim, would he? (He probably did.)

In the Monica Lewinsky and other scandals, Clinton’s method of thoroughly destroying his accusers in the press and concealing his actions could not have been accomplished without help from others in the White House.

On the other hand, no one is suggesting that Trump asking Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son was any sort of well-rehearsed administration policy. Maybe it was, but even before the transcript was released, the whole thing appeared classic off-the-cuff Trump, just saying what he thinks. It even sounded like his now-famous speech in 2016 when he joked that Russian intelligence should release Hillary Clinton’s e-mails, since they surely had obtained copies of them from her unsecure server. The impression here is one of a man saying what came to his mind, not one hatching an intricate plot.

It’s an anti-conspiracy, which to most folks is inherently less of a problem than a conspiracy. Again, this could change. If it develops that there is more to it, that the White House used the intelligence apparatus to attack his enemies the way Nixon and Barack Obama used the Internal Revenue Service, then maybe the kind of conspiracy that fueled prior impeachments might add fuel to the fire currently being tended by House Democrats.

But until then, ethical or unethical, this appears to be Trump being Trump. For better or worse, that’s become unremarkable.

3. Impeachment Fatigue

After several months failing to invalidate his election, the self-appointed Resistance and their friends in the press turned their attention to getting Trump removed from office. This has been the state of affairs ever since. Trump’s unorthodox style has given plenty of reason to at least question the propriety of some of his actions in office, but even ordinary actions have led partisans to demand impeachment.

The Mueller investigation was the main thing on which Resistance members invested their hopes. In declaiming the theory that Trump colluded with Russian President Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election, they were trying to fix two problems: how Trump could possibly have won, and how could they get rid of him. Yet the Mueller report showed no such conclusions, and the massive effort fizzled.

This time, we are told, Trump is colluding with Putin’s sworn enemies in Ukraine to steal a different election. It’s a weird sequel, and suggests that all of the talk of kompromat may have been overblown, to say the least. Now, the story goes, Trump is happy to give military hardware to Putin’s enemies, but he wants them to investigate his opponents’ corruption in return.

Is this a serious charge? It’s certainly unseemly. Offering a sovereign action in exchange for a political one does blur the lines in a way most Americans would deem sordid.

Ukraine should investigate things that it thinks are crimes, as we should, but whether to launch a criminal investigation should not depend on the politics of the accused. That’s a rule that is often broken, but that doesn’t make it right.

4. Crying Wolf

The legal implications of that are beyond the scope of this article. The political implications are, if anything, harder to determine. But the constant barrage of attacks on Trump before now, the constant demand for escalation, the years-old calls for impeachment: they all make it easier for him to say that this is just another politically motivated attack.

He might not even be wrong. It is hard to get to the heart of the matter when the Resistance mob treats every anonymous accusation from a disgruntled bureaucrat as a slam dunk for impeachment. Tribalism makes fools of us all, at times, and it is perhaps hopeless to ask for more introspection and thoughtfulness before leveling charges against our political enemies. But this is where we are.

The radicalism of the House Democrats and their media allies has made it hard to take them seriously without more conclusive evidence of presidential wrongdoing. Resistance folk on the internet are energized by this latest incident, and Trump’s more fervent partisans are too, but most people are dead tired of all of the lawfare and 24-hour news cycle argle-bargle.

They’ll watch—we all should—but for now the Zelensky affair looks unlikely to be the knockout blow the left has been seeking.

Intel Community Secretly Nixed Whistleblower Demand Of First-Hand Info,"Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings. This raises questions about the intelligence community’s behavior regarding the August submission of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump. The new complaint document no longer requires potential whistleblowers who wish to have their concerns expedited to Congress to have direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing that they are reporting.

The brand new version of the whistleblower complaint form, which was not made public until after the transcript of Trump’s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint addressed to Congress were made public, eliminates the first-hand knowledge requirement and allows employees to file whistleblower complaints even if they have zero direct knowledge of underlying evidence and only “heard about [wrongdoing] from others.”

The internal properties of the newly revised “Disclosure of Urgent Concern” form, which the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG) requires to be submitted under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA), show that the document was uploaded on September 24, 2019, at 4:25 p.m., just days before the anti-Trump complaint was declassified and released to the public. The markings on the document state that it was revised in August 2019, but no specific date of revision is disclosed.

The complaint alleges that President Donald Trump broke the law during a phone call with the Ukrainian president. In his complaint, which was dated August 12, 2019, the complainant acknowledged he was “not a direct witness” to the wrongdoing he claims Trump committed.

A previous version of the whistleblower complaint document, which the ICIG and DNI until recently provided to potential whistleblowers, declared that any complaint must contain only first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoing and that complaints that provide only hearsay, rumor, or gossip would be rejected.

“The [Intelligence Community Inspector General] cannot transmit information via the ICPWA based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing,” the previous form stated under the bolded heading “FIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.” “This includes information received from another person, such as when an employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing.”

“If you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, [the Intelligence Community Inspector General] will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA,” the form concluded.

Markings on the previous version of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form show that it was formally approved on May 24, 2018. Here is that original Disclosure of Urgent Concern form prior to the August 2019 revision:

Here is the revised Disclosure of Urgent Concern form following the August 2019 revision:

The Ukraine call complaint against Trump is riddled not with evidence directly witnessed by the complainant, but with repeated references to what anonymous officials allegedly told the complainant: “I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials,” “officials have informed me,” “officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me,” “the White House officials who told me this information,” “I was told by White House officials,” “the officials I spoke with,” “I was told that a State Department official,” “I learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “One White House official described this act,” “Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me,” “I also learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “The U.S. officials characterized this meeting,” “multiple U.S. officials told me,” “I learned from U.S. officials,” “I also learned from a U.S. official,” “several U.S. officials told me,” “I heard from multiple U.S. officials,” and “multiple U.S. officials told me.”

The repeated references to information the so-called whistleblower never witnessed clearly run afoul of the original ICIG requirements for “urgent concern” submissions. The change to the “urgent concern” submission form was first highlighted on Twitter by researcher Stephen McIntyre.

The complainant also cites publicly available news articles as proof of many of the allegations.

“I was not a direct witness to most of the events” characterized in the document, the complainant confessed on the first page of his August 12 letter, which was addressed to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the respective chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees. Hearsay is generally inadmissible as evidence in U.S. federal and state courts since it violates the constitutional requirement that the accused be given the opportunity to question his accusers.

The anti-Trump complaint also made several false claims that have been directly refuted and debunked. While the complaint alleged that Trump demanded that Ukraine physically return multiple servers potentially related to ongoing investigations of foreign interference in the 2016 elections, the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky shows that such a request was never made.

The complainant also falsely alleged that Trump told Zelensky that he should keep the current prosecutor general at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, in his current position in the country. The transcript showed that exchange also did not happen.

Additionally, the complaint falsely alleged that T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a U.S. State Department official, was a party to the phone call between Trump and Zelensky.

“I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call,” the complaint alleged. Shortly after the complaint was released, CBS News reported that Brechbuhl was not on the phone call.

In a legal opinion that was released to the public along with the phone call transcript, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) determined that the complainant’s submission was statutorily deficient and therefore was not required to be submitted to Congress. The White House nonetheless declassified and released the document to Congress late Wednesday evening.

“The complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community,” the September 3 OLC opinion noted. “Rather, the complaint arises out of a confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received secondhand.”

“The question is whether such a complaint falls within the statutory definition of “urgent concern” that the law requires the DNI to forward to the intelligence committees,” the OLC opinion continued. “We conclude that it does not.”

It is not known precisely when the August 2019 revision to the whistleblower complaint form was approved, nor is it known which, if any, version of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the complainant completed prior to addressing his complaint to Congress.

Reached by phone on Friday afternoon, a Director of National Intelligence official refused to comment on any questions about the secret revision to the whistleblower form, including when it was revised to eliminate the requirement of first-hand knowledge and for what reason.

Intelligence Has ‘Six Ways From Sunday Of Getting Back At You’,"Yesterday, the mainstream media and Democrats continued to push the Ukraine Purse Strings Hoax, with Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, ad-libbing a fictional account of President Trump’s conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Schiff’s telling of the July 2019 conversation cast Trump as the blackmailer-in-chief who threatened to cut aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky took down the son of presidential hopeful and former vice president Joe Biden.

Schiff’s schtick didn’t last long. It was short-circuited by Trump’s declassification and release the previous day of an unredacted transcript of the call. The release of the so-called whistleblower’s complaint likewise zapped Democrats’ attempt to drive the narrative all the way to impeachment.

“The complaint from an anti-Trump ‘whistleblower,’ released Thursday, is a mix of gossip, hearsay, and misstatements of fact contradicted by publicly available evidence,” The Federalist’s Sean Davis wrote yesterday, detailing examples of each. Over the next several days expect the dissection to continue, and rightly so: Many on the right waited much too long to challenge the Russia collusion hoax, allowing the narrative to grow for more than two years.

But here the hoax is but half the story, and it is the easier half to address. With the release of the transcript and the “whistleblower’s” complaint, Trump took the case to the American public. While the left and the Never Trump right may march into the ballot box in 2020 convinced the president committed treason, the rest of the country see yet another Deep State sting trying to take down the duly-elected president.

Harder to address, though, is the other half of the story—something Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer spoke of in glee, in response to then-president-elect Trump’s criticism of U.S. intelligence agencies. “Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” Schumer told MSNBC’s host Rachel Maddow.

Schumer wasn’t alone in warning of U.S. intelligence agencies’ penchant for politicized revenge. A little over a week later, Daniel Benjamin, who had served as the principal counterterrorism advisor for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, scripted the scenario for Politico Magazine, writing:

Leakers and whistleblowers won’t hesitate. What [former Deputy CIA Director] Morell and other intelligence veterans are too decorous to mention is that Trump’s treatment of his spies will also come back to bite him in the form of leaking and whistleblowing. The intelligence community doesn’t leak as much as the Pentagon or Congress, but when its reputation is at stake, it can do so to devastating effect.

While Benjamin foretold the whistleblowing retribution we are now seeing unleashed, what’s amazing is that it was entirely made up! In his Politico Magazine article, Benjamin illustrated intelligence agencies’ ability to inflict pain on a president by way of this example: “When something goes wrong—say a military deployment to combat jihadi insurgents in the Middle East blows up in the Trump administration’s face—the press will overflow with stories telling of intelligence reports that were ignored by the White House and briefings the president missed.”

That the still-unnamed “whistleblower” had to resort to invention in his attempt to take down the president suggests that Trump runs a tight ship, has in place strong and trustworthy leaders in top positions, and has taken necessary precautions to prevent leaks. But that the “whistleblower” felt confident enough to file his highly fictionalized account of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president indicates that more swamp cleaning must be done. And that clarion call may well serve as Trump’s road to re-election.

Burisma Timeline Just Leads To More Questions About Hunter Biden,"As more information trickles into the mainstream press regarding Burisma, the natural gas company Hunter Biden worked for, the latest refrain has become “the Ukrainian prosecutor Vice President Joe Biden wanted fired was not investigating Biden’s son” when he was investigating Burisma.

But this misses the very point of the allegations being lodged at Joe and Hunter Biden. Just because Hunter wasn’t at Burisma at the time of the alleged corruption does not mean that Hunter could not have played a role in shielding the company from later allegations. He was receiving over $50,000 per month to sit on Burisma’s board, despite zero experience in the industry.

Last week, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) revealed that Mykola Zlochevsky, the Ukrainian gas tycoon at the center of the Hunter Biden debacle, was being investigated only for activity spanning from 2010 to 2012, when he was the minister of ecology. Zlochevsky founded Burisma in 2002 and later went on to work in the Ukrainian government. It is alleged that when he was minister of ecology, special permits were issued “for the use of mineral resources to enterprises founded by Burisma Limited.”

Several journalists have seized on this timeline as exculpatory of any wrongdoing from the Bidens, given Hunter did not join the board of Burisma until mid-2014. For instance, Jonathan Landay of Reuters tweeted out proudly, “Changes to the board of Burisma Limited, which are currently the object of international attention, took place only in May 2014, and therefore are not and NEVER were the subject of (the anti-corruption bureau’s) investigation,’ the bureau’s statement said. (My capitalization).”

But what these journalists seem to be missing is that the basis for accusations of corruption was not merely that Joe Biden got the prosecutor fired to shield his son’s behavior at Burisma from prosecution. Indeed, the timeline presented by NABU makes that allegation impossible to square away. But the allegation that has been routinely hinted at is the possibility that Zlochevsky hired Hunter Biden after the allegations surfaced in order to evade charges in the hopes that Hunter might use his influence to persuade his dad to push for the firing of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.

Still, there’s another possibility, one that doesn’t involve persuasion from Hunter but more a tacit understanding with Joe Biden. Hunter Biden was collecting upwards of $50,000 per month for his role at Burisma with zero prior experience in the energy sector. It’s not out of the realm to wonder whether (1) Joe Biden knew the details of his son’s latest gig and salary and (2) whether Joe regarded the last name “Biden” as an important part of his son securing that role.

As The New York Times reported, Hunter’s presence on the board was seen in the Ukraine as a way to cement the company’s Western pivot: “Their [Hunter Biden and others’] support allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans at a time when Ukraine was especially dependent on aid and strategic backing from the United States and its allies, according to people who worked in Ukraine at the time.”

Thus, as journalists begin parroting the timeline as “proof” that Joe Biden’s role in pressuring Ukrain to fire Shokin was entirely divorced from Hunter’s role at Burisma, consider the possibility that Hunter’s role could have been more about shielding Burisma as a whole from allegations.

While journalists feign consternation and disgust at the fact that President Trump would dare to express an interest in investigating these matters, remember that there are questions that deserve to be answered here. Indeed, the timeline isn’t exculpatory. And celebrating it as such is just more evidence of the media moving goalposts.

Did The Inspector General Help The ‘Whistleblower’ Try To Frame Trump?,"After President Donald Trump released the transcript of his July 25, 2019, telephone conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the left’s “whistleblower” plot began to crumble. No, Trump didn’t condition foreign subsidies on Ukraine investigating Hunter Biden, son of the former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden. And no, Trump didn’t raise the question some eight times.

Then came the declassification of the “whistleblower’s” actual complaint against the president, which made clear the still-unnamed intelligence officer was peddling nothing but gossip and hearsay, seasoned with several factual falsehoods. This further exposed the Ukraine Purse Strings Hoax as the Resistance’s sequel to the failed Russia collusion hoax.

To fully grasp the depths of the deception and duplicity, however, requires a familiarity with the governing whistleblower laws. Once those laws are understood, the latest attempt by the Deep State to take down our duly elected president become even more obvious. It also becomes clear that the “whistleblower” was not acting alone, and members of the intelligence community inspector general’s office were likely providing an assist in the attempt to bury Trump. So here’s your lawsplainer.

According to Law, This Is Not an ‘Urgent Concern’

On October 20, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed into law the “Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998,” or ICWPA. This statute provides a mechanism for individuals in the intelligence community to share classified information with congressional intelligence committees. But—and significantly, as we shall see—the statute, by its terms, only applies to “a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern.”

The ICWPA defines an “urgent concern” as involving one of three circumstances. In this case, the Ukraine “whistleblower” premised his complaint on only the first statutory definition, which provides that “an urgent concern” includes: “A serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or Executive order or deficiency relating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of National Intelligence involving classified information but does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters.”

The key here is the italicized language: Something is an “urgent concern” only if the misconduct is “relating to the funding, administration, or operation of intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of National Intelligence.”

The whistleblower’s complaint did not accuse the president of misconduct related “to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity.” Rather, he charged Trump with “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election” (an allegation the transcript negates, in any event).

The director of national intelligence also does not have “the responsibility and authority” over Trump, further establishing that the ICWPA is inapplicable to the situation at hand—which is exactly what the Office of Legal Counsel concluded in a memorandum opinion provided to the DNI general counsel: “The complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community,” Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel of the Office of General Counsel noted in concluding that the complaint did not trigger the ICWPA reporting requirements.

Selectively Quoting the Law to Change Its Meaning

The whistleblower knew the ICWPA didn’t apply—and he didn’t care. The tell came early, on page one of the nine-page, single-spaced dossier. Here the whistleblower spot-quoted the relevant statutory language, as seen below:

Notice what’s missing: that the misconduct is “relating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of the National Intelligence.”

The “whistleblower” omitted the key language because the quid pro quo scenario he was selling did not trigger the ICWPA: There was no “urgent concern” as defined by Congress. And with no “urgent concern,” there is no basis to file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG), and no triggering of the other provisions of the ICWPA.

Those other provisions address two important, but distinct, issues. First, they discuss the obligations of the ICIG and the director of national intelligence. When the ICIG receives a complaint under the ICWPA, he has 14 calendar days to “determine whether the complaint or information appears credible” and then must “transmit to the Director a notice of that determination, together with the complaint or information.”

The director of national intelligence then has seven days to forward the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. The corollary to these mandates is the (limited) right under the statute for the whistleblower to contact the congressional intelligence committees directly, if the DNI does not forward his complaint.

But without an “urgent concern,” none of these provisions apply. Without an “urgent concern,” the ICIG would reject the complaint. And without an “urgent concern,” the IC operative could not legally provide the classified information to the congressional intelligence committees under the guise of a whistleblowing scandal—which of course was the sole reason for the complaint.

This Is Probably Why the Complaint Form Was Changed

This backdrop also explodes the significance of the recent change in the ICIG “Urgent Concern Disclosure Form” that The Federalist’s Sean Davis exposed on Friday.

The prior form stated that “in order to find an urgent concern ‘credible,’ the IC IG must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing.” Then, significantly, the form noted: “If you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, IC IG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA.”

This excerpt indicates that the ICIG previously rejected complaints filed based on “second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions”: The ICIG did not merely find a complaint based on second-hand information “not credible,” the ICIG did not “process the complaint . . . as an ICWPA.”

At some point, however, the ICIG revised the “Disclosure of Urgent Concern” form, removing this caveat and accepting complaints based on second-hand information.

As Davis noted, the revised form “was uploaded on September 24, 2019, at 4:25 p.m., just days before the anti-Trump complaint was declassified and released to the public. The markings on the document state that it was revised in August 2019, but no specific date of revision is disclosed,” and the whistleblower’s complaint was dated August 12, 2019.

It is unclear whether the whistleblower submitted a form with his nine-page dossier, and if so what form, as none was declassified. One suggestion that a form was submitted is the OIG’s summary of the complaint: “According to the ICIG, statements made by the President during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign-finance laws.”

Yet nothing in the whistleblower’s complaint mentioned potential foreign campaign contributions. Was that the ICIG’s gloss of the complaint, or was that the summary the whistleblower used on the form?

Frankly, it does not matter which, if any, form the whistleblower used: What matters is whether the ICIG changed its position on accepting complaints under the ICWPA. If, prior to this charge against Trump, the ICIG refused to accept complaints based on second-hand information, but altered its procedure to trigger the ICWPA for the president, that is a huge scandal and implicates many besides the so-called whistleblower.

While the whistleblower’s plot to manipulate the ICWPA is obvious from the complaint, and so is his inaccurate partial quote of the statutory definition of “urgent concern,” the change in the form suggests complicity in the ICIG’s office. The director of national intelligence, who oversees the ICIG, should immediately investigate the investigator and determine whether there was a change in policy, when it occurred, why it occurred, and who initiated the change.

Senators Demand Answers On DNC Efforts To Get Ukrainian Dirt On Trump In 2016,"The chairmen of two Senate committees are insisting that the Department of Justice come clean about Democratic Party efforts to solicit Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, first alerted the department about the meddling in July of 2017 so it could be investigated, but under Rod Rosenstein’s leadership and the direction of special counsel Robert Mueller, the inquiries of the then-Senate Judiciary chairman were ignored.

In a Sept. 27 letter, Grassley and Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., demand the Justice Department look into the “brazen efforts by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign to use the government of Ukraine for the express purpose of finding negative information on then-candidate Trump in order to undermine his campaign.”

The senators also want to know why Alexandra Chalupa, the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants and longtime Democratic operative, has not been required to file paperwork as a registered foreign agent of Ukraine. “Aside from the apparent evidence of collusion between the DNC, Clinton campaign, and Ukrainian government, Chalupa’s actions implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA),” Grassley wrote in 2017. “Chalupa’s actions appear to show that she was simultaneously working on behalf of a foreign government, Ukraine, and on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign, in an effort to influence not only the U.S voting population but U.S. government officials.”

In their letter sent this week, Grassley and Johnson ask why DOJ still has not required her to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine.

The attacks against Trump for a phone call with the Ukrainian president come on the heels of the implosion of the Russia collusion narrative, in which special counsel Robert Mueller declared there was no evidence of collusion. Insiders expect revelations about how that false narrative was spread by and to Democratic officials in the executive and legislative branches and the media. The Department of Justice inspector general is expected to release a wide-ranging report on his investigation of surveillance abuses perpetrated in the service of that false narrative in the coming weeks. Additionally, John Durham, a federal prosecutor, is spearheading his own investigation into the origins of the hoax that affected the 2016 campaign and the Trump administration.

Last week, the Justice Department confirmed that Durham is investigating the Ukrainian government’s involvement in attempts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. In his call with the Ukrainian president, Trump asked for his cooperation with that probe.

Democrats and the media have falsely accused the president of tying military aide to investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter. However, a transcript of the phone call that was released last week showed there was no connection between the two matters. Under a 1990s mutual legal assistance treaty, the U.S. and Ukraine are obligated to cooperate in such investigations.

Johnson and Grassley list several specific ways Chalupa solicited Ukrainian officials’ help for the Democratic National Committee, including to spread dirt about Trump campaign official Paul Manafort, to find information to prop up the Russia collusion information operation, and to serve as sources for American media which were publishing the narrative. Congressional testimony confirms that the collusion with Ukrainian officials extended beyond Chalupa to Fusion GPS, the firm that was secretly funded by Clinton and the DNC to peddle the false narrative.

The senators suggest the recent attacks on Trump are a matter of projection by Democrats. “After two years, more than 2,800 subpoenas, approximately 500 search warrants and witness interviews, and $30 million in taxpayer money, Robert Mueller reported that then-candidate Trump did not collude with the Russians or any other foreign government to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. In contrast, however, the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee hired Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research against candidate Trump, which included, among other efforts, the hiring of former British Intelligence Officer Christopher Steele to compile the ‘Steele Dossier’ that reportedly used Russian government sources for information. These facts continue to raise concerns about foreign assistance in the 2016 election that have not been thoroughly addressed,” the two wrote.

Why Nancy Pelosi Now Supports Impeachment Even Though It’s Insane,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a mediocre political strategist, but a very good tactician. We should not make the mistake of thinking that we understand something about the politics of impeachment over the Ukraine call that she does not.

Pelosi, who would love to remove Trump but has no realistic options for doing so, has had to thread the needle on impeachment for months. With roughly 200 House Democrats now supporting impeachment to various degrees (or perhaps 218, depending on whose head counter you trust), her options dwindled, and no longer included verbal gymnastics alone.

The latest Ukraine-related non-scandal is almost irrelevant for its lack of substance. This is not about substance. This is about Pelosi losing control of her caucus should she continue to resist impeachment, and Pelosi sensing a looming electoral disaster of monumental proportions should impeachment be launched outside the parameters she defines.

There’s Nothing Impeachable In the Phone Call

Having read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, I can say there is literally nothing there. There is no mention of military aid to Ukraine, of freezing or un-freezing of any aid, of any quid pro quo, or of any pressure on Zelensky to do anything.

I would argue that, given the nexus of the Biden family corruption to Ukraine, it is entirely proper for Trump to ask Zelensky for help investigating the precise circumstances of the Biden family enrichment. That Biden is now running for president does not give him immunity—a criminal running for president is still a criminal.

If the situation were reversed, and if a corrupt Republican ex-vice president were running for president, no Democrat would ever hesitate to ask every foreign government in the world for help in investigating that person. Nor do Democrats hesitate to ask for foreign help in investigating sitting Republican presidents. The 2018 letter to Ukraine (!) by Senate Democrats asking for an investigation of Trump is illustrative.

Anyone who is not a rabid Democratic partisan and gets through the five pages of single-spaced text of the transcript will walk away with a feeling that it’s all pretty boring nonsense. As impeachable offenses go, this one is a complete dud. So if Pelosi’s intent is to remove Trump from office for some specific (and real) offense, she is SOL. There is nothing in the transcript to hang her hat on.

This Isn’t About a Crime, It’s About Politics

Even if Pelosi only suspected this on September 24, when she supposedly jumped the gun on impeachment, she surely knew it the next day, when Trump released the transcript of the call. So why green-light the Full Monty impeachment farce three days later, when it was clear as day that this “bombshell” was already fizzling, just like all the other “bombshells”?

The answer is simple: the absence of impeachable offenses makes no difference whatsoever, because the outcome is pre-determined, and Pelosi’s options are stark: start the impeachment now, and retain control of the narrative, or start a month or two from now, and lose control completely, with the impeachment hearings dragging on into the primary season.

Pelosi understands perfectly that an election where the Democratic Party is framed as a single-issue party, whose sole concern is an impeaching a president over two casual sentences in a phone call, will be catastrophic. But she has run out of rope.

Impeachment proceedings are a given, because her caucus now almost unanimously demands it, and her caucus demands it because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the Resistance crazies and the hard left. Pelosi has also run out of cute euphemisms for impeachment—the usual Pelosi mumbo-jumbo, like “inquiry,” “investigation,” and “official inquiry,” no longer work without giving the crazies the real deal.

Pelosi had to get ahead of the tidal wave before it drowned her. As Spartan women used to say to their men, “Return with the shield, or on it.” Pelosi, who generally does not lack in political courage, would rather return with the shield this time, and live to fight another day. So she chose the better of two bad options.

Getting Rid of Joe Is a Side Benefit

Pelosi also understands quite well that the first Democratic casualty of all this will be Joe Biden. His sputtering campaign will not survive months of scrutiny of his son’s shady dealings with Ukrainian-Russian gas companies while he was handing U.S. taxpayer money to Ukraine. But Pelosi can live with this. If she has to toss Biden overboard, then so be it.

This is why Pelosi is putting a time limit of a final impeachment vote by end of the year. This is why she is circumscribing the supposed impeachable offense universe to just “the Ukraine thing”: letting the Jerry Nadlers and the Elijah Cummingses run away with tangential issues means dragging the show out into the primary season.

So no Stormy. No Mueller. No Russia collusion (at least, not explicitly — she probably hopes that people can’t tell the difference between Russia and Ukraine.) No Trump hotels. No emoluments. No obstruction. Just Ukraine.

Then Back to Blaming Evil Republicans

With the House vote done by December, Pelosi can congratulate the troops, and move on, regardless of the result (not that it’s in any doubt). She can then proudly proclaim that the House Democrats have been diligent in saving the republic, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and those nasty obstructionist unpatriotic Republicans in the Senate refuse to see the light.

With a straight face, she can tell the lunatics and the impeachment fanatics that she has given them exactly what they asked for, and that it is up to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer now. Then she can privately breathe a sigh of relief.

Pelosi can then spend 2020 working to retain her House majority, while hoping Republican voters lose their energy by next November. Democratic candidates can spend the next year talking about something else, anything else, and at least have a chance of defeating Trump.

Pelosi knows that if impeachment is on the voters’ minds next year, Trump will be reelected in a tsunami. Her majority and speakership will go the way of the Dodo bird. The only way to change that narrative is to do the impeachment show now, and forget all about it next year.

How Republicans Should Fight Back

So what should Trump and the Republicans (not to conflate the two!) do, given that Democrats have issued a declaration of war?

First, all of us out here in the real world must make it abundantly clear to congressional Republicans that spinelessness and defeatism in the face of extreme Democratic aggression will not be tolerated by their voters. Any Republican member of Congress who votes with Democrats on this one must be primaried and must lose—no excuses, no explanations, no rationalizations, no dark nights of the soul.

This is a war declared on all of us. There is no compromise and no middle ground. No Republican can win reelection if his base turns against him, and voting with Democrats is the one sure way to lose the base. Every congressional Republican must either rediscover his vertebrae, or start composing his retirement announcement.

Fight Them from the Executive Branch

Second, the word “cooperation” must be erased from the lexicon of everyone in the executive branch who is dealing with Congress. Every single demand by the Democrats must be fought tooth and nail. Delay every response. Then delay some more.

Voters out here in the real world care little about process, when the Democrats can’t explain coherently what specific crime Trump supposedly committed.

If they demand something by Monday, inform them late Sunday evening that the matter is still under review. Then claim privilege and refuse to provide documents. Then provide redacted documents. Voters out here in the real world care little about process, when the Democrats can’t explain coherently what specific crime Trump supposedly committed.

Refuse to provide witnesses, and if the witnesses have no choice but to appear, delay and reschedule. Limit the scope of their testimony in advance. Argue about every question. Insist on closed-door testimony. Claim privilege over the most trivial details and conversations.

Let the Democrats run to the courts—nothing happens in court instantaneously. Then appeal. Then appeal again. Then claim a change of circumstances, and start the whole thing over. All this will take time—days, weeks, months. The public will be bored with the endless wrangles over process.

This is not 1974. We’ve all seen thousands of these squabbles and congressional hearings. The clock will be ticking, and nobody will hear that clock better than Pelosi.

Make the Obstruction Charge Come True

Third, every Republican on Rep. Adam Schiff’s intelligence committee (which, oddly enough, is in charge of the impeachment proceedings) must dedicate his every waking moment to obstructing Schiff and his merry gang of comrades. Every question must be interrupted. Every procedural point must be raised to delay, thwart, frustrate, and obstruct.

Every single committee vote must be along party lines. Yes, Republicans will lose, but the purely partisan nature of this charade will be highlighted again and again. Every congressional hearing must turn into a farce.

Regardless, the outcome of the impeachment process is a foregone conclusion. Democrats will vote to impeach Trump. This is a fact, and there is no point shedding tears over it or debating it. No amount of brilliant oratory by lawyers, no pointing out the absence of any actual facts of any crime, not even ironclad proof of actual innocence, will make the slightest difference.

Republicans might as well get used to the idea now: President Trump will be impeached. But when and how this happens can be turned to our advantage.

You Want Impeachment? Come and Get It

Fourth, force the Democrats to vote again and again, including vulnerable Democrats. For example, Democrats already fired off subpoenas on Friday, demanding State Department documents by October 4. But the House has yet to hold a single vote authorizing impeachment proceedings, and until it does, there is nothing. For a swing district Democrat (and there are dozens who got elected by the skin of their teeth in 2018), each such vote brings him one step closer to becoming an ex-congressman.

Republican voters need to remind their Republican member of Congress, again and again, that they’ll be looking for another job should they even think of siding with the enemy.

Pelosi knows this, so don’t let her get away with an impeachment that starts without a full House vote, just on her say-so in a press conference. Democrats want documents for impeachment? Then the House must vote on impeachment first.

The final impeachment vote? Republican voters need to remind their Republican member of Congress, again and again, that they’ll be looking for another job should they even think of siding with the enemy. Let it be 236-198. The whole thing will be remembered only as an unhinged partisan hate show.

Fifth, the Senate. We already know how little McConnell thinks of all this. I wouldn’t presume to know his strategy, but I can suggest one: as soon as the House votes to impeach, schedule a quick vote the next day: to convict or not, up or down. Give it two hours of “debate,” and then vote.

That’s it. Show is over. The vote will be 52-48 to acquit (yes, Mitt Romney, you worthless cream puff of a weathervane, I am thinking of you), and that will be that.

This latest twist is merely another battle in the endless war. A House vote to impeach President Trump is now a virtual certainty and, by itself, of little consequence. What matters is what we conservatives out here do with it. Our first task must be to stiffen the backbones of our cowardly representatives.

ICIG Admission Of Whistleblower Changes Raises Explosive New Questions,"On Monday, the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG) admitted that it did alter its forms and policies governing whistleblower complaints, and that it did so in response to the anti-Trump complaint filed on Aug. 12, 2019. The Federalist first reported the sudden changes last Friday. While many in the media falsely claimed the ICIG’s stunning admission debunked The Federalist’s report, the admission from the ICIG completely affirmed the reporting on the secretive change to whistleblower rules following the filing of an anti-Trump complaint in August.

The ICIG also disclosed for the first time that the anti-Trump complainant filed his complaint using the previously authorized form, the guidance for which explicitly stated the ICIG’s previous requirement for firsthand evidence for credible complaints. The Federalist reported last week that it was not known which form, if any, the complainant used, as the complaint that was declassified and released to the public last week was written as a letter to the two chairmen of the congressional intelligence committees.

Under the law governing whistleblower complaints for members of the intelligence community, the inspector general has near-total authority to determine whether a complaint is credible or not. The law is silent on what type of evidence is required and leaves that decision entirely to the discretion of the inspector general. As a result, the internal policies set by the ICIG’s office are the regulatory rules governing the examination of whistleblower complaints. Because of this wide discretion granted under the law, the ICIG’s internal changes to its own policies and guidance regarding firsthand evidence — which the ICIG admitted to in its press release on Monday — directly impacted its treatment of the anti-Trump complaint filed in August.

In its press release, the ICIG also explicitly admitted it changed its policies because of the anti-Trump complaint, raising significant questions about whether the watchdog cooked its own books to justify its treatment of the anti-Trump complaint:

In the process of reviewing and clarifying those forms, and in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint, the ICIG understood that certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read — incorrectly — as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.

The ICIG’s claim that it would have been incorrect to perceive a requirement for firsthand information is bizarre considering the previous version of the form clearly stated in unambiguous language that firsthand evidence was required in order for “urgent concern” whistleblower complaints to be deemed credible. It said, in bold, underlined, all-caps text, “FIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED”:

Because the complaint did not allege wrongdoing against a member of the intelligence community (the president of the United States is an elected constitutional officer, not an employee of a statutory agency), did not allege wrongdoing with regard to an intelligence activity (a phone call between two elected world leaders is basic diplomacy, not the execution of a statutorily required intelligence activity), and relied primarily on hearsay rather than firsthand evidence, both the director of national intelligence (DNI) and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel determined that the anti-Trump complaint was not an “urgent concern” under the law and was therefore not required to be transmitted to the relevant congressional committees. In spite of those determinations, the ICIG on its own and after revising its internal guidance and policies regarding firsthand evidence decided the complaint did qualify as an “urgent concern” and forwarded the anti-Trump complaint to Congress.

The ICIG did not inform the DNI of the existence of the anti-Trump complaint until Aug. 26 and did not inform Congress of the complaint until Sept. 9. On Sept. 13, the DNI informed Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, that the complaint did not meet the statutory definition of an “urgent concern” and would therefore not be shared with Congress. The complaint was formally declassified by the president for release to the public on Sept. 25.

This timeline raises significant questions about the rationale for the rule changes by the ICIG, as it would be improbable, except in the case of illegal classified leaks, for the press to have inquired about the anti-Trump complaint in August, when the revisions to the forms and policies were claimed to have been formally made, according to markings on the new whistleblower forms which claim they were revised in August of 2019. While the previous forms requiring firsthand evidence show they were approved on May 24, 2018, the new forms do not disclose the specific date of the revision. If the ICIG did not inform the congressional committees of the particular whistleblower complaint until Sept. 9 and did not transmit the letter until Sept. 13, how could any members of the media have inquired back in August about the specific anti-Trump complaint or its relation to the previous requirement for firsthand information in whistleblower complaints?

The ICIG in its press release also failed to disclose when precisely its whistleblower forms and rules were changed, despite top lawmakers on oversight committees in both chambers specifically requesting that information. The specific date of the changes to internal evidentiary requirements is essential to determining whether the ICIG changed its own policies and procedures to justify forwarding to Congress a complaint that under the previous standard may not have been deemed credible.

The president’s release of the transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that numerous allegations within the complaint filed with the ICIG were false. For example, the complainant falsely alleged that Trump demanded Zelensky return multiple servers from CrowdStrike, an IT contractor for the Democratic National Committee, that were physically located in Ukraine. Trump made no such demand. The complainant also alleged that Trump urged Zelensky to either hire or retain a particular government prosecutor in Ukraine. That exchange never happened. Additionally, the complainant alleged that a specific State Department official had listened in on the phone call between the two leaders. The State Department stated last week that particular official did not listen in on the phone call.

The anti-Trump complaint that was released last week, which congressional Democrats are using as the basis for impeachment proceedings against the president, is riddled not with evidence directly viewed by the complainant, but repeated references to what anonymous officials allegedly told the complainant: “I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials,” “officials have informed me,” “officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me,” “the White House officials who told me this information,” “I was told by White House officials,” “the officials I spoke with,” “I was told that a State Department official,” “I learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “One White House official described this act,” “Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me,” “I also learned from multiple U.S. officials,” “The U.S. officials characterized this meeting,” “multiple U.S. officials told me,” “I learned from U.S. officials,” “I also learned from a U.S. official,” “several U.S. officials told me,” “I heard from multiple U.S. officials,” and “multiple U.S. officials told me.”

In fact, the ICIG admitted in its Aug. 26 letter to the DNI that its office never even reviewed the transcript of Trump’s phone call with Zelensky prior to determining whether the complainants hearsay allegations about the phone call were credible.

“As part of its preliminary review, the ICIG did not request access to records of the President’s July 25, 2019, call with the Ukrainian President,” Michael Atkinson, the ICIG, wrote.

“I decided that access to records of the telephone call was not necessary to make my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern ‘appears credible,’” he stated.

Although the ICIG stated in its Monday press release that the complainant claimed on his whistleblower form to be in possession of firsthand evidence of criminality by Trump, the complaint released to the public contains no such firsthand evidence. A congressional official told The Federalist on Monday that the House Intelligence Committee has not received the underlying whistleblower complaint form submitted by the anti-Trump complainant.

Michael Atkinson, the ICIG, is slated to testify under oath before the House Intelligence Committee later this week.

Mark Sanford: Recent Allegations Show Trump Should Be Impeached,"Former South Carolina Republican governor Mark Sanford, who is challenging President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, said Monday that the president should be impeached based on an anonymous whistleblower complaint.

Appearing on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” Sanford made clear that the House of Representatives should proceed with the process, but added that “at first glance,” the president should be impeached based on the recent allegations charging the president with conspiring with a foreign leader to meddle in the next U.S. presidential election.

“Do you think what he did with Ukraine was appropriate?” Noah asked Sanford on the program, referencing the July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky .

“Absolutely not,” Sanford said.

“Do you think it was an impeachable offense?” Noah followed up.

“I don’t want to prejudge the process,” Sanford replied. “It would seem to me that the logical answer is yes… I want them to go through their process. Again, I’m not going to prejudge the process.”

“What you don’t do as president of the United States is say ‘Why don’t we get our attorney general involved with a foreign power to help wipe out a domestic political foe.’”

Sanford’s comments come as the former governor fights an uphill battle to unseat Trump in the Republican primary while the president faces the most serious threat to power yet in the form of an official impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats.

Sanford cautioned earlier in the day on CNN that the impeachment process will be bruising for both major parties going forward.

Last week, a complaint from an anonymous whistleblower was made public based on a recently declassified and unredacted transcript of a phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart. The complaint charges Trump with asking Ukrainian officials to keep investigating potential corruption in Ukraine linked to Democratic frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden.

House Democrats rushed to impeachment early last week before both the transcript and the complaint were even released to members of the House, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announcing the beginning of proceedings on Sept. 23.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/01/mark-sanford-recent-hearsay-allegations-show-trump-should-be-impeached-at-first-glance/,2019-10-01
"According To Hunter Biden, Joe Biden Lied About Ukraine","Last week in Des Moines, Iowa, Joe Biden told a reporter that he never discussed his son’s overseas business dealings, but Hunter Biden tells a different story.

On July 8, The New Yorker reported:

In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: ‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’’

Yet on Sept. 21, not two months after The New Yorker story published, Biden told reporters at the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa something different, reported USA Today.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said. “Here’s what I know: Trump should be investigated.”

A newly released photo also seems to contradict Biden’s story. In the photo below of the time he was vice president, Joe Biden is seen golfing with his son, Hunter Biden, and an executive board member of the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings. Burisma is the company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month to sit on its board while Joe Biden oversaw Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

Fox News reported the man furthest to the left in the photo below is Devon Archer, who served on the Burisma executive board with Hunter Biden.

🚨BOMBSHELL 🚨

Joe got the prosecutor investigating the company fired soon after:https://t.co/bu7QunPR7G pic.twitter.com/0aVJNhYQqX — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) October 1, 2019

According to Fox News, the photo was taken at the Hamptons in August 2014, just four months after Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma executive board.

In 2018, Biden publicly celebrated pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was looking into corruption within Burisma, using U.S. aid as leverage:

I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. (Laughter.) He got fired.

Americans Have Every Reason To Be Suspicious Of The Whistleblower,"For two years, our political and media elites assured us that a wide-ranging independent counsel investigation of Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election would reveal that the Trump campaign, and indeed Trump himself, colluded with Moscow to steal the election. The Robert Mueller probe, we were told, would prove it.

Not only did that turn out to be false, but as the investigation dragged on it became clear that the origins of the probe were highly suspicious, implicating senior intelligence officials in the Obama administration and raising questions about whether the whole thing was a political hit job from the start.

Now those same political and media elites are assuring us that Trump has broken the law and must be removed from office—not for colluding with Russia, but for pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. We’re told that Trump threatened to withhold military aid, and that he improperly involved Attorney General William Barr in this extortion scheme, along with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

We’re supposed to accept that this is what happened, that what the anti-Trump whistleblower complaint describes is confirmed by the unredacted and publicly released transcript of Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. We’re not supposed to question the veracity of the whistleblower’s complaint or the purity of the whistleblower’s motives. And we’re definitely not supposed to question why the standards for submitting whistleblower complaints were changed just last month to allow complaints based on secondhand information to be deemed credible.

In other words, we’re not supposed to question whether this whole thing has been a political hit job from the start.

Well, forgive us if we pause. Just like the Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier that launched the Russia probe, the Ukraine complaint is based entirely on hearsay and contains blatant falsehoods and misstatements of fact.

In fact, everything about the Ukraine affair thus far has the same stink as the origins of the Russia probe—the suspicious actions of unelected intelligence community bureaucrats, the hysterical proclamations of congressional Democrats, the uniform efforts of the media to distort every aspect of the story in the service of an impeachment narrative. Sound familiar?

The Complaint Origins Are Suspicious

Democrats and the news media are treating the Ukraine affair like a Watergate-sized crisis just as they treated the Russia probe before it came to a conclusion.

Now, just like with the Mueller investigation, legitimate questions are emerging about how all this got started. As far as we know, the whistleblower complaint contains no direct, firsthand information, which until last month was a requirement for a complaint to be considered credible. My colleague Sean Davis first reported that the intelligence community quietly gutted that requirement at some point between May 2018 and August 2019.

Then on Monday, the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG) released a statement that confirmed Davis’ reporting, and admitted that its complaint form and policies regarding evidentiary requirements had been altered in response to the anti-Trump complaint filed in August. In addition, the ICIG statement revealed the whistleblower had used the old complaint form, which explicitly stated that firsthand knowledge was required in order for a complaint to be considered credible.

This is important because the federal statue governing whistleblower complaints in the intelligence community gives the ICIG broad authority to determine whether a complaint is credible, as well as authority to determine what kind of evidence is required to meet that threshold. The ICIG has 14 days after receiving a complaint to determine whether it’s credible, and if so the complaint is passed along to the director of national intelligence (DNI).

In order for the complaint to be considered an “urgent concern,” and be passed along to Congress, it has to meet three criteria: it must be found credible, it must be related to an intelligence activity, and the complaint must be against an employee or contractor of the intelligence community.

In this case, the DNI and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel found the complaint was not an “urgent concern” as defined by federal statute (because the complaint wasn’t related to an intelligence activity and because the president is not an employee of the intelligence community) and therefore need not be shared with relevant congressional committees. The ICIG ignored that determination and notified Congress even though the complaint didn’t meet the statutory definition of an “urgent concern.”

The ICIG’s statement notably doesn’t say when the complaint form was changed to reflect new evidentiary standards that allow complaints with only secondhand information to be deemed credible. As Davis notes, knowing this timeline “is essential to determining whether the ICIG changed its own policies and procedures to justify forwarding to Congress a complaint that under the previous standard may not have been deemed credible.”

As it is, the fact that ICIG developed new forms that don’t require firsthand information suggests that it was done as an after-the-fact justification of how the anti-Trump whistleblower’s complaint was handled.

Meanwhile, the mainstream media have been trying to distract attention from the questions surrounding these revelations by pretending either that such details don’t matter or that anyone raising questions about them is doing so in bad faith. The Daily Beast ran an article this week dismissing Davis’ reporting as a “hoax story,” even while admitting that the form was indeed changed and that the new form does indeed alter the type of evidence needed for the ICIG to judge a complaint credible.

The Media Is Dismissing All This As a Conspiracy Theory

At the same time, the media is treating the Trump administration’s investigation into the dubious origins of the Mueller probe as a conspiracy theory. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that Attorney General William Barr has been holding private meetings overseas with foreign officials as part of that effort, which Trump himself disclosed back in May.

Vox was quick on the draw with an explainer headlined, “The right-wing conspiracy theories behind Trump and Barr’s outreach to foreign leaders.” A report from the Washington Post noted, “Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in reexamining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct.”

But here’s the thing: hand-waving all this away as a conspiracy theory isn’t going to work. The American people have every reason to be suspicious of the emerging Ukraine narrative, and simply appealing to the authority of current and former intelligence officials, many of whom lied to Congress and illegally leaked to the press, isn’t going to change anyone’s mind.

Many Americans no longer trust those people because they have proven untrustworthy. After the fiasco of the Russia investigation, they’re going to need more than assurances from our political and media elites that this time, really, honestly, Trump is guilty of an impeachable offense.

ICIG Didn’t Review Ukraine Call Before FWDing Whistleblower Complaint,"On Monday afternoon, the Intelligence Community Inspector General published a press release describing his office’s handing of whistleblower complaints, attempting to quell the firestorm created by untimely changes to a key whistleblower form that raised suspicions amongst the public and members of Congress.

Unfortunately, this firestorm does not appear to be dying down, and elements of the release only cast further doubts on how Atkinson and his team have handled this entire episode, and whether they are finally being forthright about the rationale and timing of the changes or trying to obfuscate their way through the crisis. The release clearly confirmed that the IG did in fact remove the “first-hand information” requirement from the form in August, as The Federalist first reported last week.

The release also attempted to leave the impression that the change was routine with its timing unrelated to the Ukraine complaint. It spent nearly an entire page of the three-page document describing an initiative to update forms that was apparently ongoing in the organization. Notably, multiple press outlets have used that characterization to minimize the issue, some even calling genuine concerns about the apparent subterfuge by the ICIG a “hoax story.”

Nobody has seriously argued that the ICIG wouldn’t be allowed (or even obligated) to begin an investigation regardless of the source of an allegation. The outrage is because the ICIG was caught with its hand in the cookie jar trying to protect the optics of a “credibility” determination that continues to draw more scrutiny as more time passes.

A lack of first-hand knowledge of an allegation should not disqualify it, but it reasonably drives questions about the overall credibility of a complaint. Which is what investigations are for.

The Investigation that Never Happened

As I noted previously, Atkinson promised during his confirmation hearings to conduct investigations in accordance with the basic quality standards promulgated by Council of the Inspectors General. However, in a shocking review of the recently declassified letter he transmitted to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on August 26, we learn that his investigation didn’t even include a review of the phone transcript at the core of the entire complaint. Yes, you read that right.

In the letter, the inspector general of the intelligence community explains that, “As a part of its preliminary review, the ICIG did not request access to records of the President’s July 25, 2019, call with the Ukrainian President.” He continued, “I decided that access to records of the telephone call was not necessary to make my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern ‘appears credible.’”

It appears that the IC IG bought into the allegations in the whistleblower’s complaint so completely that he didn’t even afford the president the presumption of innocence and appropriate due process. His letter continued, “I concluded that it would be highly unlikely for the ICIG to obtain those records within the limited remaining time allowed by statute.”

His letter makes no claim that he received any pushback from the White House. He simply “anticipated” it would require “lengthy negotiations,” and therefore didn’t even attempt to review the transcript summaries before making his determination the complaint “appeared credible.”

It is unclear if he ever reviewed the transcript before it was made public by the White House. Once the transcript summary was released, it was shown that the whistleblower complaint was riddled with gossip and factual errors, calling into question whether the IC IG would still consider it credible now.

Atkinson’s Promises During His Confirmation Hearing

The 55-year-old Atkinson was nominated for the position by President Trump and “with the support of the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats,” as Atkinson put it in his opening remarks before the Senate confirmation hearing. He previously served in the DOJ’s National Security Division as an acting deputy assistant attorney general and as senior counsel to the assistant attorney general. He sailed through his confirmation hearing in January of 2018.

Ironic in retrospect, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held the confirmation hearing for both Atkinson and Jason Klintenic in tandem. Klintenic assumed the office of general counsel for ODNI, and the two later tangled over whether this whistleblower complaint represented an “urgent concern” under applicable statutes. Atkinson ultimately succeeded in forcing the disclosure of the whistleblower report to the congressional oversight committees.

At the confirmation hearing, Atkinson was repeatedly asked about the whistleblower statute and how he would approach the job in the context of the ICWPA. Here are a few of his exchanges.

In his answer to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden about how he would protect whistleblowers from reprisals, Atkinson pledged to “take their case, treat it very seriously, treat it impartially, follow the facts, wherever they lead.”

He later elaborated on his approach to the whistleblower program in his response to Sen. James Lankford, where he said “as a prosecutor, I understand deterrence and I understand that investigations have to be timely, they have to be thorough, and they have to be effective.”

Wyden asked him about personnel, and the potential for “cleaning house,” to which he responded, “the whistleblower protection program, like any other part of the office, is dependent on having the right people in the office.”

Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked about his ability to be independent in order to be effective. Atkinson’s response was “I think that my training as a prosecutor helps in terms of having a commitment to independence and integrity, as well as discipline, and understanding that there is a need to speak truth to power. The hardest part sometimes is finding the truth. The truth–as a prosecutor in a criminal case, it’s difficult.”

Yes, indeed: “the hardest part sometimes is finding the truth.” Especially when you don’t even look for it.

Atkinson’s Coordination With the House Intel Committee

After sending the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence detailed correspondence on Sept. 17 outlining his disagreement with ODNI on whether the complaint amounted to an “urgent concern” under the statute, Atkinson met with the committee behind closed doors two days later on Sept. 19, where he was presumably a strong advocate for his perspective.

It has been reported in various media outlets that Atkinson is scheduled by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s committee for another closed-door session this Friday. Since his handling of the whistleblower report has directly led to an impeachment inquiry by the Democrat-controlled House, you can be assured his testimony will be critical to understanding the events that brought us to this point.

Given how much of this constitutional crisis is already playing out before the public, and the implications for the nation, it would seem inappropriate to not have at least a portion of his appearance be in open session. Even if they choose to have an additional closed-door session, there appears to be little reason to hide the entire proceedings from a public increasingly trying to grasp whether these impeachment proceedings represent a final “gotcha” moment for the embattled president, or yet another unsubstantiated “witch hunt,” as the president and his supporters claim.

If the House doesn’t provide for public hearings, Chairman Richard Burr should immediately call Atkinson before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and conduct their own hearing. While it is understandable that the Senate wants to avoid anything connected to the messy impeachment saga as long as they can, the concern that the whistleblower statutes are being misapplied and politicized is very much their responsibility to investigate.

GOP Sens Demand Investigation Of Leaks From Whistleblower Complaint,"GOP Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released a statement demanding the inspector general of the intelligence community investigate leaks regarding the Russia probe and the Ukraine call.

Johnson and Grassley sent a letter to the ICIG, Michael Atkinson, calling for more transparency about actions taken to investigate leaks of classified or sensitive information. They sent a letter in early May calling on the ICIG to investigate leaks from the Russia probe. Now, the senators have issued a follow-up letter about the Ukraine call.

“The IC complaint’s material and material relating to President Trump’s call with Ukraine were also leaked, and those leaks included classified information,” the senators wrote. “News reports used anonymous sources to report on information relating to the complaint and phone call that were classified at the time.”

According to Grassley and Johnson, the ICIG has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of an investigation into the leaks. They believe the IC should be just as transparent as the White House in releasing information regarding the whistleblower complaint.

There is no question that someone in, or close to, the intelligence community leaked classified information. Over the past two years there have been numerous leaks from government agencies, but without an investigation or accountability there seems to be no stopping the leaks.

The New York Times reported Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) learned about the whistleblower complaint before it was filed. That information was supposed to be classified.

In Johnson and Grassley’s letter addressed to Atkinson, the senators said they believe the leaks — regardless of whether they pertain to Russia or Ukraine — are a partisan interest game that inevitably impedes the president from executing his duties. Simultaneously these leaks undermine national security, the integrity of the federal administration, law enforcement, and counterintelligence investigations.

Johnson and Grassley request that Atkinson answer the following questions:

Is the ICIG investigating the classified leaks relating to the IC complaint and Ukraine call? If not, why not? How many people within the ICIG office had access to the complaint and call transcript before they were made public?

The senators requested this information be handed to their respective committees by October 10.

Impeachment Is Nothing But Throwing Dirt And Hoping Some Will Stick,"The process the Democrats have employed to gin up support for impeaching President Donald Trump has been almost as long as Chairman Mao’s long march. It has also been tragically absurdist. It is filled with twists and turns as the Democrats slog through the muck they have raked up in their attempt to obviate the 2016 presidential election by overthrowing the will of the American voter and throwing out President Trump.

Their march commenced with Trump’s historic election in November 2016, which prompted a Texas Democrat to announce his intention to introduce Articles of Impeachment within months of President Trump assuming office.

Democrats have tossed every piece of dirt and dung at the president hoping that something would stick. Well, nothing has. People who just throw anything in the air end up covered with the stuff they are tossing. In other words, if you ever want to know what the Democrats are doing, just observe what they are accusing everyone else of doing.

The Russia Accusations Were Proven False

Take Hillary Clinton. She was so devastated by her loss to President Trump that she joined others to claim the Trump campaign had “colluded” with the Russians to affect the outcome of the election. After 22 months of the Robert Mueller investigation, even his team of politically biased investigators concluded that there had been no “collusion,” conspiracy, coordination, or cooperation.

But we did find the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had engaged an opposition research firm with ties to Russia and the United Kingdom to dig up dirt on then-candidate Trump. The now-infamous Steele dossier was created out of whole cloth using those foreign sources to simply make up some of the most outrageous lies against Trump in the history of American politics.

And now Nancy Pelosi, who had attempted to slow down Democrats’ impeachment fantasies, has yielded to the pressure of her radical colleagues. She has spread this unauthorized “impeachment inquiry” among six different House Committees, ostensibly freezing out House Judiciary because Chairman Jerrold Nadler continues to embarrass Democrats with his pronouncements and ineffective hearings that have brought their less-than-stealthy intention to impeach President Trump to public disapprobation.

That leads us to the process Speaker Pelosi now wishes to employ—a process that betrays the precedent for these proceedings. Pelosi has gotten caught up in Trump Derangement Syndrome. During the Nixon and Clinton proceedings, the attorneys for those presidents could represent their clients, and in some cases, they were allowed to question witnesses. Not so in the 2019 political attack by Democrats.

Impeachment is “somber,” Pelosi says. If she truly believed that, then why would she select one of the most-virulent Trump attackers to lead the investigation? Of course, impeachment is a partisan process, but in the Nixon and Clinton cases there was overwhelming, bipartisan support for the investigations, confirmed by a vote of the full House to authorize them. Why so different now?

Because, in the aforementioned cases, there were allegations that many believed were, or easily could be, substantiated. Further, in the earlier proceedings, each side believed the rules of impeachment would be followed, but we haven’t even voted on such rules in President Trump’s case. And as I mentioned earlier, Democrats have hyped impeachment of Donald J. Trump since Election Day 2016.

We Don’t Need No Stinkin’ Rules

Since taking over the House, Democrats have shown a blatant disregard for the rules of the House and the committees. They already have skirted the rules in this unauthorized impeachment inquiry, meaning there will be a lack of due process for the president. That means the American people are at risk to have their votes overturned by rampant procedural sleights-of-hand, rather than legitimate evidence of a high crime or misdemeanor.

The Democrats are simply still in shock that Donald Trump was elected in 2016. Their goal is to subvert the will of the American people.

So, Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has been chosen as the face of the inquiry in spite of his promise that there would be evidence of Russian collusion, when there wasn’t; in spite of his promise to impeach the president, before his inquiry had begun; in spite of evidence of his hatred of this president (as demonstrated by his willingness to accept “evidence” from Ukrainian sources, which is what he claims is impeachable for President Trump); in spite of his blatant falsification of the telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which he later claimed was a parody. Schiff simply doesn’t have the disposition to lead the impeachment inquiry.

So Just Keep Changing the Story

Pelosi is confused. She and the Schiff team forecasted that President Trump berated, threatened, and offered a quid pro quo more than half a dozen times in the phone call with the Ukrainian President, but that was a lie.

When the transcript revealed that there was no sticks or carrots, and that the Ukrainian president introduced the subject of the 2016 electoral interference by the Ukraine, Democrats’ narrative again failed. So, they switched to saying the threat was implied, like a mob boss. That was hooted off the public stage to the accompaniment of President Zelensky and Ukraine’s foreign minister saying there was no threat.

Pelosi, Schiff, and their minions then switched to the old standby of claiming that there was a cover up. But that, too, has failed because the Trump administration has provided many documents, including the transcript, the complaint of the leaker that started this renewed impeachment episode, a legal memo from the Office of Legal Counsel, and even correspondence with the government of Australia.

Schiff does not have the disposition, gravitas, or character to lead this inquiry. Speaker Pelosi won’t even make this a formal inquiry by holding a floor vote in the House, indicating that, while the vast majority of her conference is in vocal support of an investigation or impeachment inquiry, she doesn’t have enough votes to formally authorize the process.

So, after marching in the wilderness for a couple of years, Schiff and company want to impeach President Trump by Thanksgiving. After all, we wouldn’t want Democrats to be inconvenienced at the holidays with their thoughts of attacking the president of the United States and all those who voted for him.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/03/impeachment-is-nothing-but-throwing-more-dirt-and-hoping-some-will-stick/,2019-10-03
It’s Not A Crime For Trump To Ask China And Ukraine To Investigate Biden,"President Trump threw a glass of cold water over the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives today by essentially stipulating to the main allegation being made against him. In fact, he doubled down on it.

Asked about what he wants Ukrainian President Volomydyr Zelensky to do about Hunter Biden’s business dealings there Trump said, “I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.” He also suggested that China should open a similar investigation. But what Trump was mostly saying is that he is the president and there is nothing wrong with saying such things to foreign leaders.

The issue of whether the president may urge foreign leaders to conduct investigations of American citizens running for office has now become the crux of the impeachment inquiry. Long gone now are allegations of any quid pro quo with Zelensky. That ship sailed when the transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukrainian leader offered no evidence that the president was offering military aid as a carrot, which was the initial allegation.

Now Democrats insist that no quid pro quo is needed to prove a high crime or misdemeanor occurred during the phone call. Instead, they insist, this is a question of an illegal campaign contribution. They seem to be suggesting that Trump was asking the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden, rather than asking them to root out corruption that allegedly involved his son Hunter Biden, and potentially the former vice president himself.

But is that a high crime or misdemeanor? We know that Hunter Biden took an extremely lucrative job from a Ukrainian energy concern for which he had no relevant experience. Is it really so strange for Americans to want to know if what he was really offering was access to the vice president?

Likewise we know that Hunter Biden traveled to China with his father on Air Force Two in 2013, and that during that trip he met with a Chinese banker, and 10 days after the trip the Chinese granted a license for a new fund on which Hunter was a board member.

Perhaps these are just coincidences. Perhaps Hunter Biden possesses some vast expertise in business that he honed while snorting cocaine during his time in the Navy. But it does not seem completely unreasonable to imagine his proximity to the White House might have played a role in his hiring.

That brings us back to President Trump. Trump clearly feels that something untoward and perhaps illegal occurred regarding Hunter Biden in Ukraine and China. In regard to the former, he received information from attorney Rudy Giuliani raising questions about the firing of a prosecutor investigating the company where the younger Biden worked. So the question is, is it illegal for Trump to ask foreign leaders to look into it?

The answer to this question seems to almost certainly be no. In fact, the closest thing the Democrats can pin to the president is a vague campaign finance violation. Is it tacky? Does it violate norms? Yes, probably, but it is just as plausible that Trump wanted answers about family members in the Obama administration getting sweet deals from foreign governments as it is that he was trying to damage a potential political rival.

And what if both things are true? What if Trump is genuinely concerned about corruption in our foreign affairs, and the fact that Joe Biden might be mixed up in it is a just a bonus? If there are cases, which there certainly are, when it is appropriate and legal for a president to urge foreign leaders to investigate potential wrongdoing by Americans, then the Democrats have to prove why in this case is wasn’t.

Their answer is that Joe Biden is running for president. Their entire argument for impeachment now rests on the idea that Biden’s candidacy makes him immune to such calls for scrutiny. But they will not and can not point to an actual law that Trump violated in the conversation. Rather, they make vague arguments about courting foreign interference in an election and potential campaign finance violations.

Today Trump called the Democrats’ bluff. Now both sides have stipulated that Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden, and that he may ask China to do the same. Democrats are free to impeach the president on this basis, even without pointing to a specific crime. The Senate is free, as is likely, to acquit the president, since there isn’t any crime.

Then it will be left to the voters. The ball is in the Democrats’ court. Impeachment without a specific crime is a risky play, but they may have gone too far to un-ring this bell.

Ukrainian Officials Didn’t Believe Trump Used Funding As Bargaining Chip,"Ukrainian officials did not think that President Trump was using U.S. aid as a bargaining chip when he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke in July. According to BuzzFeed News, at the time of the infamous phone call now used as the basis for Democrats’ latest impeachment efforts, the Ukrainian president thought U.S. aid was already on its way. This aligns with what The New York Times reported last week in regards to the Zelensky government not thinking aid might be withheld.

Two Ukrainian officials and one U.S. official shared that at the time of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian government was still expecting aid from the United States. They had no idea that the aid was being withheld and were “stumped” to hear nearly a month after the call that it had been suspended.

This contradicts the Democratic narrative that Trump was engaging in an insidious quid pro quo by withholding military aid from Ukraine to compel them to investigate former vice president and 2020 Democratic contender Joe Biden, among other requests.

According to BuzzFeed, Ukrainian officials were expecting $250 million in aid from the Pentagon and $141 million from the State Department. They learned of the suspended aid in a letter from Ukraine’s embassy in Washington nearly a month after the phone call. Although Trump had ordered the aid to be withheld in mid-July before the July 25 phone call, Zelensky has previously stated that he was not told why.

As political pundit Ben Shapiro has pointed out, it is impossible to have a quid pro quo if the other side does not know it is being threatened. Without that, what would otherwise compel Ukraine to allegedly perform a given set of actions on Trump’s behalf?

Even the whistleblower’s complaint expressed skepticism as to whether Ukrainian officials knew that aid was being withheld: “As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it.” Believing both the reporting of BuzzFeed and The New York Times would mean that the whistleblower’s sources about the knowledge of Ukrainian officials were not reliable.

Indeed, knowledge of withheld aid is a fairly dramatic error, given such knowledge initially served as the basis of the quid pro allegation at the heart of Democrats’ claims of corruption. Now, Democrats have walked back their claims, with some attempting to fashion a circumstantial “quid pro quo” while others, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tacitly suggesting no quid pro quo is needed to impeach President Trump.

But it doesn’t stop with the Democrats. ABC News actually mislabeled a former Ukrainian advisor as a current advisor to President Zelensky. This error was magnified when the advisor alleged that Trump refused to meet with the Ukrainian president unless the Biden question was brought up. Not only was this advisor not currently serving in Zelensky’s administration, but he was not doing so at the time of the July phone call, either.

ABC was forced to issue a correction, but it had nonetheless established the false narrative of a quid pro quo. At a time when journalism has increasingly become defined by the mantra of “publish now, factcheck later,” it is hard not to wonder why all the errors seem to transpire in one direction and what kind of damage such reporting does to public’s ability to obtain and retain the truth.

Indeed, the machinations of a quid pro quo seem increasingly to be a concoction of the media and House Democrats in order to justify putting the country through the trauma of impeachment proceedings, despite the lack of evidence to bolster the anti-Trump whistleblower’s allegations.

Schiff Tapped Former MSNBC Contributor To Question Key Ukraine Envoy,"A former MSNBC contributor was tapped by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to question Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker during a congressional hearing on Thursday, officials with direct knowledge of the proceedings told The Federalist. Daniel Goldman, a former legal analyst for MSNBC, posed multiple questions to Volker during Thursday’s closed-door interview of Volker.

Payroll records from the U.S. House of Representatives show that Schiff hired Goldman in January of 2019. News reports from last March indicate that Schiff named Goldman as the director of investigations for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). Schiff has used his perch as chairman of that committee to investigate and spread debunked conspiracy theories, such as Russian collusion, about President Donald Trump. Former special counsel Robert Mueller confirmed earlier this year that his investigation found zero evidence of treasonous collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign to steal the 2016 election from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

“How can the American people trust that this impeachment process is fair if MSNBC and Adam Schiff are running the show behind the scenes?” a congressional official with direct knowledge of Thursday’s hearing told The Federalist. “This partisan mockery cannot be ignored. Schiff should be ashamed.”

At one point Goldman became so flustered during his questioning of Volker that Schiff unexpectedly shut Goldman down and began questioning Volker himself, one official said.

Following a New York Times report that the anti-Trump complainant and his team previewed their allegations with Schiff’s committee before filing the complaint with the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG), Schiff was blasted for blatantly lying about his committee’s secret coordination with the anti-Trump complainant. Schiff’s most egregious lies about his staff’s illicit interactions with the anti-Trump complainant were made on MSNBC, the left-wing cable news network where Goldman previously worked as a legal analyst.

Last December, Goldman endorsed discredited conspiracy theories from Christopher Steele, a former British spy who was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to work with foreign governments to spread dirt about Trump in order to influence voters in the 2016 presidential elections. In December, Goldman claimed that a debunked allegation that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague in August of 2016 to secretly plot with Kremlin officials had been corroborated. He also claimed, long after the Steele dossier had been debunked, that “nothing had been undermined” in the dossier.

In his 448-page report detailing the findings of his sprawling, multi-year investigation of Russian collusion allegations, Mueller explicitly debunked the notion that Cohen traveled to Prague.

“Cohen had never traveled to Prague,” the report declared.

In July of 2018, Goldman claimed the FBI would have been “derelict” if it failed to cite false claims from the Steele dossier in multiple Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, warrants in 2016 and 2017. Goldman’s article, entitled “FBI Would’ve Been Derelict Not to Use Steele Dossier for the Carter Page FISA Warrant,” argued that the FBI was obligated to use the debunked claims from a Clinton- and DNC-funded foreign operative to justify spying on Trump campaign affiliates.

As an MSNBC contributor, Goldman also falsely claimed during the nomination and confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that Christine Blasey Ford’s rape accusations against Kavanaugh had been corroborated.

“[S]ome corroboration already does exist,” Goldman wrote in October of 2018. Goldman also claimed that notes from one of Ford’s 2013 therapy sessions, which did not even mention Kavanaugh’s name, nonetheless corroborated her allegations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at an unspecified place on an unspecified date at some point in the 1980s.

In fact, none of the individuals Ford named as having been present when the alleged altercation occurred corroborated her account. Leland Keyser, Ford’s best friend at the time who Ford claimed was at the house party where Kavanaugh allegedly tried to rape Ford, said she did not believe Ford’s story.

“I don’t have any confidence in [her] story,” Keyser said. Keyser also told the FBI during a follow-up investigation of the allegations that she had no recollection of the events Ford alleged, didn’t know Brett Kavanaugh, and that Ford’s friends pressured her to change her story after she said she could not corroborate Ford’s account of what happened.

Prior to joining MSNBC, Goldman worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York under federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, an anti-Trump partisan and former Democratic Senate staffer who Trump fired in March of 2017.

A spokesman for Schiff did not respond to questions asking if other former cable news commentators also asked questions of Volker during Thursday’s interview, or if Goldman leaked allegations from the anti-Trump complainant before the ICIG informed HPSCI of the complaint on Sept. 9.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/04/adam-schiff-tapped-former-msnbc-contributor-to-question-key-ukraine-envoy/,2019-10-04
Volker Testimony Directly Contradicted Democrat Impeachment Narrative,"Congressional testimony from the former top American envoy to Ukraine directly contradicts the impeachment narrative offered by congressional Democrats and their media allies. Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served for two years as the top U.S. diplomatic envoy to Ukraine, testified on Thursday that he was never aware of and never took part in any effort to push the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter. He also stressed that the interactions between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials were facilitated not to find dirt on Biden, but to assuage concerns that the incoming Ukrainian government would not be able to get a handle on corruption within the country.

Volker’s full remarks, which were obtained by The Federalist, can be read here.

“As you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion” during negotiations with Ukraine, Volker testified. Cherry-picked snippets of those texts were released by the office of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., late Thursday evening.

“[A]t no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,” Volker told lawmakers.

Volker said that an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked Volker to connect the advisor to Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump.

“[I]n May of this year, I became concerned that a negative narrative about Ukraine, fueled by assertions made by Ukraine’s departing Prosecutor General, was reaching the President of the United States, and impeding our ability to support the new Ukrainian government as robustly as I believed we should,” Volker said. “After sharing my concerns with the Ukrainian leadership, an advisor to President Zelensky asked me to connect him to the President’s personal lawyer, Mayor Rudy Giuliani.”

“I did so solely because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine, that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support,” Volker said. “I also made clear to the Ukrainians, on a number of occasions, that Mayor Giuliani is a private citizen and the President’s personal lawyer, and that he does not represent the United States government.”

Volker vehemently denied that he ever urged the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on the Biden family.

“As you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion,” he said.

Volker testified that he never even mentioned a delay on U.S. military assistance to Ukrainian officials until late August, when news reports indicated that funding had been put on hold. Volker’s statement directly undercuts claims that the funding was part of a quid pro quo meant to force the Ukrainians to take certain actions in order for the military aids to be released.

“I became aware of a hold on Congressional Notifications about proceeding with that assistance on July 18, 2019, and immediately tried to weigh in to reverse that position,” Volker testified. “I was confident that this position would indeed be reversed in the end, because the provision of such assistance was uniformly supported at State, Defense, NSC, the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the expert community in Washington.”

“As I was confident the position would not stand, I did not discuss the hold with my Ukrainian counterparts until the matter became public in late August,” he said.

Volker explained in his remarks that Trump had a dim view of the Ukrainian government given its involvement in 2016 efforts to damage Trump’s presidential campaign, and that the president’s view of rampant and widespread corruption in the country was a significant barrier to cooperation between the two nations going forward. According to Volker, the interactions between Giuliani and Ukraine were sought in an effort to persuade Trump that Zelensky’s government could be a trusted U.S. partner.

“It was clear to me that we had a growing problem in the negative narrative about Ukraine, built on these earlier accusations by Mr. Lutsenko, that was impeding the development of our bilateral relationship and the strengthening of our support for Ukraine,” Volker said. “I therefore faced a choice: do nothing, and allow this situation to fester; or try to fix it.”

“I tried to fix it,” he testified.

Volker said Giuliani eventually came to believe that the Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, was not credible.

“To my surprise, Mr. Giuliani had already come to the conclusion on his own that Mr. Lutsenko was not credible and acting in a self-serving capacity,” Volker said. “He mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election, and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws.”

While Volker said he did not believe any of the accusations of corruption levied against Biden, he felt that allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections were “plausible.” Contrary to Democratic assertions that Trump’s diplomatic team was actively demanding that Ukraine interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, Volker said his team did the opposite.

“The point about Ukraine avoiding anything that could play into U.S. elections in 2020 is a message that I know our Chargé in Ukraine, Amb. Bill Taylor, reinforced in other meetings,” Volker said.

The diplomat also said he didn’t even know the Biden family had been referenced at all in Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky.

“I was not on the July 25 phone call,” Volker said. “I received a general readout via our Chargé and my own State Department staffer, as well as from Mr. Yermak.”

“All said it was a good, congratulatory call, that they discussed the importance of fighting corruption and promoting reform in Ukraine, and that President Trump reiterated his invitation to President Zelensky to visit the White House,” he testified. “I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son, which I only learned about when the transcript of the call was released on September 25, 2019.”

Everything You Need To Know About Dems' Demands For Impeachment,"The impeachment story begins in the heart of the Washington swamp. House Democrat Adam Schiff and his intelligence committee staff cooked up a carefully crafted “whistleblower” complaint with an anonymous CIA bureaucrat. In a gossipy document full of inaccuracies, the anonymous CIA guy alleged that, during a call with Ukraine’s newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Trump threatened military aid to Ukraine unless its government investigated Joe Biden.

Why was Trump talking to Zelensky about Biden? Starting in 2014, Biden’s son Hunter made about $50,000 a month acting as a director for a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. Hunter locked in this huge salary, not to mention work directed to his law firm, despite being recently kicked out of the military for using cocaine and having no energy industry experience. At the time, Joe Biden was a key Obama administration emissary in dealing with Ukraine.

Later, in 2016, Biden bragged about getting the prosecutor fired who happened to be investigating the Ukrainian, Burisma-owning oligarch, by threatening to withhold billions of dollars in American loan guarantees. Democrats claim the prosecutor was corrupt and that Joe Biden’s actions had nothing to do with Hunter Biden’s business activities. You be the judge of that.

Trump’s Call with Zelensky

Right away, in response to the CIA guy’s claims, the White House released the transcript of the call with Ukraine’s president, which revealed no such threatening occurred. In fact, the Ukrainians did not know that aid was on hold at the time of the call. Although the media had alleged there’s something nefarious about Rudy Giuliani contacting the Ukrainian president’s lawyer, it turns out the State Department asked Giuliani to do this, and it was Ukraine’s president who brought up Giuliani on the call, not Trump.

The only “favor” Trump asked for on the call was for Ukraine to aid the Justice Department’s investigation into 2016 election interference. Here, Trump brought up the missing Democratic National Committee server the FBI never examined — the basis upon which the Hillary Clinton campaign claimed Russia was trying to help Trump get elected. Trump said he wanted Zelensky to assist Attorney General William Barr’s investigation into how the Clinton-fueled Russia narrative was allowed to infect the federal bureaucracy.

Trump told Zelensky he was concerned that the “same people” in Ukraine who had helped fuel the Russia investigation were still in power. The Ukrainian president, who ran for office on fixing Ukraine’s endemic corruption, promised all “investigations will be done openly and candidly.” This pleased Trump, who then mentioned the Ukrainian prosecutor who Biden got fired, saying he was concerned that a “good” prosecutor was “shut down.” “It sounds horrible to me,” said Trump. That’s it.

Two asides: On the call, Trump asked Ukraine’s new president about 2016 election interference because many of Democrats’ wild claims during the Russia investigation came from Ukraine. In fact, Democrats had explicitly threatened Ukraine aid in order to get Ukraine to provide dirt on Trump, which, oddly enough, is the exact same thing they’re accusing Trump of doing.

The other aside is that viewing military aid to Ukraine as some sort of sacred cow is ridiculous. Ukraine presents deep corruption concerns, but also geopolitical concern. Ukraine is such a large weapons producer that it arguably doesn’t need U.S. weapons aid, and the United States risks being sucked into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia over the issue.

No Turning Back from Impeachment Now

Back to the impeachment story. Despite the White House’s release of the transcript, the media didn’t back down and took to selectively reading parts of the transcript and grossly twisting it in order to smear Trump. Schiff even read a made-up version of the transcript during a House hearing. In other words, the Democrats opened the impeachment box, and they can’t close it.

That’s why people like CNN’s Jake Tapper have openly taken to repeating Democrat talking points. For example, a common talking point is that Joe Biden couldn’t have considered Hunter Biden’s business interests because “the Burisma investigation was dormant.”

First off, the fact that an investigation into a shady oligarch, Ihor Kolomoyskyi, was ever opened by the prosecutor Biden got canned is fishy enough. This oligarch is no saint. For example, Kolomoyskyi has allegedly used private military forces for “hostile takeovers” of rival business interests. Second, the media’s line just isn’t true. At the time Joe Biden forced the prosecutor’s firing in March 2016, there were two inquiries open into Kolomoyskyi involving taxes and corruption.

Then things got even more spooky. It turned out the CIA official in question didn’t even have access to Trump’s call, but only heard about it through second-hand sources. But the rules require that a whistleblower has firsthand knowledge.

To circumvent this, the “intelligence community” inspector general — who’s actually supposed to keep the CIA in check and was created to stop CIA abuses — changed the rules at the last second so Democrats’ “whistleblower document” could go forward. Of course, the media tried to blatantly lie about the fact that the CIA’s inspector general had changed the whistleblower rules at the last second.

Why Democrats Are Doing This

The Democrats’ case for impeachment is hopeless, but their motivation is simple. They whipped up their base into such a delusional frenzy during the “Russia investigation,” they have to keep the narrative going at all costs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faces a rebellion from her caucus if she doesn’t go along with it.

Clearly, this is going to blow up in Democrats’ faces. In fact, the best thing that can happen for Trump is for Democrats in the House to vote to impeach. Then Trump can talk about Democrats obsessing over impeachment, instead of a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada (which would help farmers and factory workers), bipartisan drug pricing reform, or infrastructure.

The White House is and should be very confident, then. Trump’s approval rating is already up since this impeachment frenzy began. Democrats and the media probably just handed Trump a second term.

But there’s a group of intelligence bureaucrats at work here, and their motivation is a bit different. An immediate motive may be to prevent an investigation into how the Russia probe started. This includes an investigation into how a document the Hillary Clinton campaign created — using anonymous Russians and a British national tied to Russia — was used by our intelligence agencies to investigate Trump.

The other possible motivation is more complex. During the “Russia investigation,” many in the intelligence agencies worked to subvert Trump’s foreign policy and remove Trump, through spying, a large series of leaks, and articles planted with friendly outlets. Trump’s campaign was even spied on before the election, via something called the “two-hop rule,” once a secret court granted a warrant to spy on Trump campaign officials such as Carter Page.

Because of this, the White House moved to cut off the broader “intelligence community” — inexorably tied to America’s foreign policy establishment that Trump ran against — from information the White House knew many in the intelligence agencies would use to selectively leak.

That could mean some of what’s going on today, at least from the CIA angle, is intelligence bureaucrats “striking back” because they lost their access to diplomatic communications, a coveted source of the intelligence community’s power. But even the Obama administration liked to hide diplomatic calls from the broader intelligence community, which should tell us something about that bureaucracy.

The Real Story Is Unhinged Intelligence Bureaucracies

In other words, the real big takeaway here is that we have a problem with our Washington bureaucracy, including our intelligence agencies, which have routinely crossed the line into policymaking. How much of the impeachment mess is due to CIA bureaucrats being incensed that Trump, who is elected, would dare to question military aid to Ukraine, and would dare to curtail their eavesdropping on diplomacy?

The unelected Washington bureaucracy that has been created in the last 60 years, especially the intelligence agencies, is too unaccountable and too powerful. And many in this bureaucracy, though they think themselves saints, have the worst of intentions.

Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, without batting an eye, that Trump shouldn’t challenge these intelligence agencies because they have “six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.” That spells great danger to the republic, no matter who is president.

These agencies should not be treated like sacred cows. If they misbehave too often, they should be shelved. And the CIA has a long history of abuses. Of course, many people in the intelligence agencies are good people who care about our country’s safety. But too few checks and balances make holding officials accountable too difficult.

That’s why Trump should run in 2020 on making it easier to fire federal government employees, and he should propose measures to increase accountability and transparency. Our founders set up a system of checks and balances, wherein no part of the government was unaccountable to another part, or ultimately to the voters. This was based on a timeless truth: Unaccountable and unelected power would always be abused, even by those with the best of intentions.

Biden Calls For Trump Impeachment Despite His Crooked Ukraine Record,"Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has endorsed impeaching President Trump over a phone call with Ukraine’s president discussing investigating potential corruption involving Biden and his son while Biden was vice president.

“Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts,” Biden said. “To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.”

“We believe Americans should decide American elections, period. But Donald Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy,” Biden said. “It’s stunning, and it’s dangerous because it directly threatens our democracy. This is not hyperbole, it’s a fact. No president in American history has ever dared to engage in such unimaginable behavior.”

The former vice president continued, “With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry. He’s already convicted himself.”

While Biden predicated his impeachment rhetoric on the recent Ukraine debacle, he immediately revealed his true motives, reminding voters that Democrats have maintained their “punishment in search of a crime” strategy since losing the 2016 election. He said, “We have to remember that impeachment isn’t only about what the president’s done. It’s about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office.”

Although Biden didn’t call for impeachment as quickly as other Democrats have, other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates were quick to endorse the inquiry in lieu of a fair fight on the electoral field.

I look forward to seeing Donald Trump impeached as soon as possible. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 29, 2019

Donald Trump has shown us he is lawless, and last week he gave us even more evidence that he is not fit for office. He must be impeached. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 30, 2019

Donald Trump is now openly calling for foreign governments to interfere in our elections from the White House Lawn. If he thinks openly committing the same crime will convince people his secret calls weren’t illegal—he's wrong. We will hold him accountable. He must be impeached. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019

The answer is clear. pic.twitter.com/TOzSU5avlc — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 28, 2019

These impeachment calls come after a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was thrust into public view thanks to media-manufactured hysteria over a whistleblower complaint. Later, it was revealed that not only did the whistleblower lack firsthand knowledge of the conversation, but the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) had secretly altered the form whistleblowers must fill out to eliminate a certification they have direct, firsthand knowledge of alleged misconduct, as Sean David reported here at The Federalist.

Further, The New York Times reported that the anti-Trump complainant had presented his allegations to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., prior to filing the complaint with the ICIG. Byron York also reports the whistleblower has professional ties to a 2020 Democratic candidate for president.

During Biden’s push for impeachment, he also said, “One thing about this president is absolutely clear, and I don’t think anyone can contradict this: He has seen no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says. He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He’s even willing to hold Congress and congressionally appropriated aid to a foreign nation hostage to his personal political demands.”

Biden’s comments on Trump’s interest in his personal political demands are ironic, especially with regard to Ukraine, since Biden’s Ukraine record isn’t clean. During Biden’s stint as vice president, he pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating his son Hunter’s company, which he later bragged about. Despite his complete lack of relevant experience, Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian national gas company Burisma in 2014, a role for which he was paid $50,000 per month.

Despite his support for impeachment, Biden doesn’t seem to believe congressional efforts to impeach Trump will be successful, saying after endorsing the inquiry, “He has another year in office.”

Biden said that just like any other bully he’s ever known, Trump’s actions reveal “he’s a coward, he’s afraid. He’s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November.” If that’s going to happen, though, then why is Biden supporting impeachment instead?",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/09/joe-biden-calls-for-trump-impeachment-despite-crooked-ukraine-record/,2019-10-09
6 Ways Salem Witch Trials Were Fairer Than Dems’ Impeachment Inquiry,"Attorney Greg Jarrett recently wrote, “It is Pelosi and Schiff who are abusing the power of impeachment in their latest ‘witch hunt.’” This is wildly historically inaccurate. Jarrett should immediately apologize to the memory of the prosecutors of the 17th-century Massachusetts witch trials.

This is because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff are currently running their Ukraine impeachment farce with far less due process than the superstitious and backwards legal system offered the “witches” of Salem.

Below are a few examples of how Jarrett has unfairly slandered the jurisprudence of 17th-century Massachusetts.

1. The Right to Be Informed of the Nature of an Accusation

In 1692, the “witches” were tried under the Witchcraft Act of 1604, or, in long-form, “An Act Against Conjuration, Witchcraft and Dealing with Evil and Wicked Spirits,” a felony. Then-President Nixon stood accused of “payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses,” in violation of federal witness tampering statutes. President Bill Clinton stood accused of perjury, lying under oath.

What law is President Trump accused of violating during the Ukraine phone call? The accusations against Trump are far vaguer and never seem to relate to any statute, law, or provision of the Constitution. What little explanation there is for the “law” the president broke is extremely vague.

One fanciful theory is that the president violated 52 U.S.C. §30121 prohibiting a candidate from “soliciting” from a foreign entity a “thing of value” (meaning dirt on a political opponent) in connection with a federal election. This is the same ridiculous argument that was made in the Russia collusion hoax when Donald Trump Jr. supposedly solicited Russians for dirt on Clinton (never mind the “Russians” were in partnership with the firm Clinton hired to frame Trump).

That argument failed in the Russia hoax for the same reason it’s wrong now: Asking for information is never a “thing of value” for purposes of election law.

Witches in 1692 knew exactly what law they stood accused of violating because New England witch hunters respected this principle of due process more than Schiff and Pelosi do. The president’s counsel noted this deficiency in this letter, indicating that among the many unfair aspects of the procedures, the committee failed to observe “the right to be informed of the law of the charges against you.”

2. The Right to Public Hearings

We have reason to believe the witch prosecutors held public trials because a man by the name of Cotton Mather recorded accounts of many of the trials. In contrast, as noted by the Wall Street Journal, Schiff is attempting to conduct “secret” hearings to cherry-pick and leak evidence (often with much exaggeration).

Schiff used a similar technique during the Russia collusion hoax, claiming (falsely) that he had seen direct (but secret) evidence that the president colluded with Russians. It’s highly problematic when the chairman of the House intelligence committee smears the president by making a non-factual claim about secret intelligence.

3. The Right to Confront and Cross-Examine Witnesses

It’s not clear that the accused witches ever had the chance to cross-examine their accusers. So on that front, Jarrett’s comparison might be appropriate. However, the historical record indicates that the accused were present during the trial and given the opportunity to listen to what was being said about them.

In contrast, Schiff is running a sort of kangaroo court in which the public is only allowed to hear third-hand accounts of secret witnesses. The identity of both leakers remains secret even as their allegations are being aired in the public. Again, Schiff is using procedures that witch hunters in the 1600s would consider unfair.

Other complaints include: Denying witnesses the right to counsel, denying the president the opportunity to be represented by an attorney at the proceedings, and denial of the right of the minority to cross-examine witnesses or call their own witnesses.

4. A Legal Predicate

History records that when an individual was accused of witchcraft, her case would be heard by a duly appointed local magistrate with jurisdiction. Later, the colony governor authorized a specially created Court of Oyer and Terminer.

In contrast, in the Ukraine farce, the House intelligence committee (which does not have obvious jurisdiction) is leading an inquiry not authorized by the House. The president’s attorney points to the absence of a vote on impeachment by the full House as a basis for challenging the jurisdiction of the inquiry. But it’s actually far worse than that.

The House has voted on whether to impeach this president, and three times (December 6, 2017, January 19, 2018, and July 17, 2019). The House voted “no” on each of these attempts to impeach the president. In other words, the House three times voted against what Schiff is currently doing. And he’s doing it anyway.

5. The Presumption of Innocence

Most of the accused witches were found not guilty. Of the approximately 200 people who were accused, 19 were found guilty. While the best result would have been zero, it provides some measure of redemption to the process that the outcome was not always predetermined at the time of the accusation.

Contrast this to the treatment of Trump and the effort to impeach him that began before he even obtained the presidential nomination. Whether it’s Russian collusion, daring to contradict intelligence employees, emoluments, or Stormy Daniels, the verdict remains “guilty” even as Democrats endlessly search for a charge to match their pre-determined outcome.

6. Spectral Evidence

The early witch trials relied on “spectral evidence,” a type of evidence only visible to the witness such as dreams or visions. In November 1692, Massachusetts passed legislation creating the Superior Court of Judicature, which would later disallow spectral evidence as unreliable.

In contrast, Schiff seems to have revived the practice of creating evidence out of his dreams, visions, and fantasies. He famously used a public hearing to paraphrase the president’s phone conversation with the president of Ukraine.

Either the chairman intended for the public to accept his version as factual, in which case he used his position to mislead the public, or he made a big joke out of something that he should have been treating seriously. In either case, it would have not passed due process muster in 17th-century witch trials. By the way, Schiff moonlights as a screenplay writer for those who find his fantasies irresistible.

It’s fascinating that Pelosi cloaks herself in the “rule of law” when she cannot muster minimum principles of due process that attended the witch trials of Salem almost 100 years before the U.S. Constitution. Since the witch trials, our founders codified many of these principles in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution (a public trial, public witness testimony, the right to know the crimes one is accused of, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, etc.)

Thus, calling the Ukraine inquiry a “witch trial” is literally an insult to witch trials.

The 2020 Democratic Primary Has A New Frontrunner: Elizabeth Warren,"2020 Democratic White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren has now eclipsed former vice president Joe Biden as the crowded field’s new frontrunner for the first time this election cycle.

A slew of new polls released this month pushed Warren over the edge to frontrunner status as concerns surrounding Sen. Bernie Sanders’ health following a recent heart attack and questions regarding Biden’s dealings with Ukraine plague her top-tier rivals’ campaigns.

Warren’s campaign entered October rapidly picking up steam as polls began to show the new far-left standard-bearer leading in the critical early primary and caucus states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

According to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of national polls as of Wednesday, Warren now leads the rest of the field with 26.6 percent support, ahead of Biden at 26.4 percent, with Sanders falling behind in a distant third at 14.6 percent. All other candidates running fall well below 10 percent. As extremely narrow, Warren’s new lead is well within the error margin on these polls.

In September, a well-received debate performance in the middle of the month combined with key endorsements and quality fundraising totals unveiled last week have propelled the Massachusetts senator to the front of the pack.

Warren, one of the left-wing field’s farthest left candidates, spent much the summer competing with Sanders for second and third place, finally breaking from the Vermont senator at the end of September after the candidate with a reputation for big plans unveiled new proposals that resonated with the party’s progressive base.

The communist-affiliated Working Families Party, which had backed the openly socialist senator’s presidential bid in 2016, this time endorsed Warren. The endorsement was announced on the same day Warren rolled out her newest plan to address Washington corruption with a speech to more than 20,000 people gathered in New York City’s Washington Square Park.

As Warren soars, Sanders sinks with Biden, and the Vermont senator’s recent heart attack has raised more concerns about his health and stamina to take on President Donald Trump next fall, let alone be president. Biden’s campaign has also struggled as new allegations at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Trump have placed a new spotlight on the Biden family’s shady dealings with Ukraine.

While the Trump administration deals with charges of conspiring with the Ukrainian president to interfere in the next U.S. presidential election, Biden and his family’s business interests in the country have come under heightened scrutiny as well. Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for $50,000 a year despite no prior experience in the industry while his father oversaw U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president.

While Biden began to clash with Warren and Sanders at the last Democratic debate, the two far-left senators have remained allies on the campaign trail as in the Senate with nearly identical socialist platforms.

Going forward, Warren still faces several weaknesses that her campaign must overcome to clinch the Democratic nomination. Warren polls terribly with African-Americans, a crucial voting bloc that was essential to the victories of Barack Obama, and the electoral successes of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

While the Massachusetts liberal is winning high levels of support among women, young people, and the college-educated, she is still struggling with African-Americans, although recent polls suggest Warren is improving among this key group. An Economist/YouGov poll shows Warren winning 15 percent of African Americans surveyed, trailing only Biden, who has 36 percent.

Warren has also been facing her own credibility issues. She was recently caught in another major lie about facing sex discrimination. Warren often claims that she was once fired after her first year of teaching at a school in New Jersey because she was “visibly pregnant,” but recently uncovered documents contradict the senator’s claims. According to records first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, New Jersey’s Riverdale Board of Education unanimously approved Warren’s contract for a second year in 1970. The following year, the school board accepted Warren’s resignation “with regret.”

The new revelations about Warren’s employment history mirror the senator’s well-documented fabrications about her native American ancestry. Warren claimed at multiple points throughout her career to be part Cherokee, even taking a DNA test last year to “prove” her heritage, although the results revealed Warren to be anywhere between 1/64th to 1/1,024th native American if any at all.

The DNA test was sharply criticized by tribal leaders, who branded Warren’s claim to Cherokee heritage as “inappropriate and wrong.” Warren has since apologized and no longer claims to be Native American after decades of falsely claiming minority status to advance her career.

Warren’s scandal involving her ancestry is unlikely to play an important role in shaping her candidacy throughout the Democratic primary, given that it has been well-exposed since her 2012 Senate run. It is however likely to be a part of the Republican strategy to discredit the senator. Trump has already made it his favorite line of attack against her, bestowing on Warren the repeated nickname “Pocahontas.”

Schiff Just Banned A GOP Lawmaker From Impeachment Deposition,"Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., just banned a key Republican lawmaker from the deposition of a former anti-Trump national security official believed to be at the center of ongoing Ukraine proceedings, sources tell The Federalist. Schiff tossed Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., out of the deposition.

Although the U.S. House of Representatives has not approved a resolution authorizing a formal impeachment investigation, House Democrats have nonetheless insisted that they have full authority to subpoena all documents and testimony they desire, even if specific committees lack the jurisdiction to demand particular information. Schiff, whom Pelosi tapped to lead her party’s anti-Trump impeachment efforts, chairs the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), which only has jurisdiction over the federal government’s intelligence agencies and related components.

According to the Congressional Research Service, formal impeachment proceedings are typically referred to the House Judiciary Committee. Gaetz sits on that committee; Schiff does not. The House has yet to approve a resolution granting broad impeachment investigative authority to any of its committees.

Several officials told The Federalist that they believe Fiona Hill, who was subpoenaed last week to share her knowledge of allegations of wrongdoing against Trump regarding a phone conversation he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, is one of the unnamed sources for the anti-Trump whistleblower whose August 12 complaint fanned congressional impeachment fires. Hill was reportedly planning to testify about her knowledge of the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, a controversial figure who was removed from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May.

Schiff has come under fire for blatantly lying about his staff’s interactions with the anti-Trump complainant. Although he falsely denied that neither he nor his staff had any interactions with the complainant, his team had actually coordinated with the complainant before the complaint against Trump was even filed.

Schiff has also raised the ire of transparency and open government advocates by selectively leaking incomplete and out-of-context information against Trump while stubbornly refusing to release full transcripts of his depositions of federal officials subpoenaed by his committee.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/14/democracy-dies-in-darkness-adam-schiff-just-banned-a-gop-lawmaker-from-attending-key-ukrainegate-deposition/,2019-10-14
"Tulsi Gabbard Breaks With Democrats During Debate, Brands Trump Impeachment ‘Divisive’","2020 Democratic White House hopeful and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii broke with 11 other Democrats on the Ohio debate stage Tuesday night, branding President Donald Trump’s impeachment as “divisive.”

“If impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country,” Gabbard said.

The Hawaii congresswoman made clear her belief that an investigation should move forward, but cautioned Democrats not to rush the process as acquittal in the Senate would allow the president to claim vindication, playing into Trump’s message that House Democrats are out to get him.

“The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House,” Gabbard asserted to the primetime audience, but followed up by issuing a stark warning moving forward. “If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.”

Other Democrats on stage were quick to demand the president’s swift impeachment and removal from office, painting Trump as a corrupt leader conspiring with foreign leaders to investigate political opponents at home. They also conveniently glossed over former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s dealings with Ukraine.

Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company for $50,000 a month without any prior experience in the energy sector while Joe oversaw U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president.

During an interview on ABC News hours before the debate Tuesday, Hunter admitted to practicing “poor judgement,” noting his father’s position of power all but secured his employment.

“It is impossible for me to be on any of the boards that I just mentioned without saying that I am the son of the vice president of the United States,” Hunter Biden said.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/15/tulsi-gabbard-breaks-with-democrats-brands-trump-impeachment-divisive-during-debate/,2019-10-15
ABC News Interview Didn’t Help Hunter Biden’s Credibility At All,"The fourth Democratic primary debate offered yet another opportunity for former vice president Joe Biden to dodge questions about his son Hunter’s shady business activities. While his father was running the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, Hunter was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, earning up to $50,000 per month despite zero experience in the energy sector.

In Tuesday night’s debate, when Anderson Cooper questioned Biden about the impropriety of this dynamic, Biden just repeated some variation of the refrain, “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong.”

Biden’s awkward sidestep coincides with the release of Hunter’s first interview since his Ukraine dealings became a topic of public discussion. This past weekend, Hunter Biden sat down with Amy Robach of ABC News to answer questions related to accusations that he leveraged his father’s political clout to close international business deals and assume lucrative board positions abroad.

This Didn’t Help Hunter’s Credibility At All

While the interview offered Hunter Biden a chance to put the corruption accusations to rest in a more intimate setting, the face-to-face interaction ended up exposing that Hunter Biden has a genuine likeability and credibility problem. In short, the interview was a trainwreck.

The exchange between Robach and Biden came across as an awkward nod to the barrage of criticisms Hunter and his father have received over the past month. Indeed, it’s quite obvious that the purpose of the interview, conducted with a forced casualness in Hunter’s dimly lit kitchen, was to somehow ingratiate Hunter Biden to those skeptical of his integrity or personal character. By this metric, the interview was an abysmal failure.

It’s not that Hunter Biden emerged from the interview an entirely amoral figure. He offered a welcomed candidness in his answers, and it’s abundantly clear he loves his father. But after watching the published portions of the interview, there is little question that Hunter is comfortable with (at minimum) the crony capitalism that catapulted him to financial success, and he’s pretty bitter, approaching insolent, if you ask him about it.

Thus Hunter’s defense isn’t likeable or credible, and this shortcoming could pose serious problems for Joe Biden if the corruption accusations ever catch traction in the mainstream press. If Hunter carries himself publicly as he did in this interview, people will neither like him nor trust him—and that may spell trouble for Joe.

How Dare You Question Me about Using My Dad’s Position

By all accounts, this interview was a “softball” interview. The questions were probing, but admittedly predictable—there were virtually no surprises in Robach’s interrogation, making Hunter’s snide retorts that much more uncomfortable. Every time Hunter snapped at Robach, I couldn’t help but ask myself, “Did he really not see that question coming?”

While Hunter’s initial posture seemed relaxed, he became increasingly agitated as Robach asked him pointed questions relating to his foreign business dealings. Robach quizzed Hunter on his board position at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company that was being investigated by Ukraine’s general prosecutor when his father, then vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to have the general prosecutor fired.

When Robach pointed out that Hunter had no experience in the natural gas sector or in Ukraine more generally, Biden snapped, “No, but I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board — if not more.” At another point, Robach quipped, “You were paid $50K per month for your position?” and Biden shot back, “Look, I’m a private citizen. One thing that I don’t have to do is sit here and open my kimono as it relates to how much money I make or make or did or didn’t.”

Hunter’s inability to contain his frustration became strikingly obvious. When Robach asked why he chose not to renew his board position at Burisma this past April, his response masked a sort of sarcastic condescension. “I think it’s pretty obvious why.” Robach, to her credit, remained unfazed. “This is your opportunity to say why.”

I’m Sorry This Looks Bad to Stupid People

Hunter failed to rise to the occasion when given the opportunity to appear composed and diplomatic. Robach’s invitation to explain his decision wasn’t confrontational in the slightest, but Hunter responded with crude indignation. “Well this is what becomes a distraction. Because I have to sit here and answer these questions. And so that’s why I’ve committed that I won’t serve on any boards or I won’t work directly for any foreign entities when my dad becomes president.” He’s staying away from foreign board positions because he’s being questioned about it, not necessarily because he sees the practice as indecorous.

In fact, Hunter says he does not regret being on the board of Burisma; instead, he regrets not anticipating that Donald Trump or Rudy Guiliani would be chasing “conspiracy” theories about his employment that he claims have been “completely debunked by everyone.” Later in the interview, he emphatically expresses no regret for allowing his Chinese business partner (and alleged “friend”) to shake hands with then-vice president Joe Biden when Hunter joined his father on a diplomatic trip to China in 2013.

His framing is damning because it shows he doesn’t reject what is at best crony capitalism—he just rejects the fact that it might be noticed and inferred to be corruption. Had this interview been exculpating, it would have resulted in Biden condemning both.

Not Giving Straight Answers

Hunter isn’t exactly honest in the interview, either. In relation to the 2013 China deal, Hunter remained mute about how private equity investments operate after Robach quizzed him about any potential financial gain he might have experienced. “Have you received any money from that [private equity] business dealing?” He responded that he hasn’t received “one cent” from the investment, but that answer is a misleading one, given Hunter still retains a stake in the firm, meaning future profits are possible. As noted in Wall Street Journal:

Hunter Biden owns 10% of the private-equity firm and the statement said he committed to invest $420,000 to acquire the stake. The statement said the younger Mr. Biden hadn’t received compensation for serving on the board of the China venture and hasn’t received any return on his investment. The statement didn’t address how Hunter Biden intends to treat his 10% stake in the Shanghai-registered firm, which has invested mostly in China and is primarily owned by some of the country’s largest financial firms.

The one genuine moment of connection in the interview was when Hunter discussed his history with addiction. It was a raw and rare moment that audiences don’t often see in politics. For his openness and courage in that moment, Hunter should be saluted. But it was probably the only portion of the interview where Hunter did not come across as disingenuous.

There were other glimmers of honesty that might have endeared audiences to Hunter, but the statements still revolved on the behavior of Trump and others, rather than on Hunter’s, showcasing his inability to assume any sort of professional responsibility.

I Respect Any Political Position that Helps Me Make Moolah

He concedes that his business activities indicated “poor judgement,” but on the basis that they “gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to [his] father.” He asserts, “That’s where I made the mistake, so I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Hunter is entirely unrepentant, and he wants audiences to know it. Instead of the interview serving as the basis of Hunter Biden’s redemption tour, it painted a portrait of a discourteous man. There were moments that you almost felt sorry for him because it was quite obvious this interview, in all its pedestrian questioning, was dramatically over his head.

At the end, Hunter Biden began to tear up when discussing the office of the presidency, one he claims he had been taught to respect. I found that sentiment frankly hard to believe, given all of the business dealings he managed to shore up while his father was nestled in the executive branch—and without one ounce of regret.

The vast majority of his responses were cheap attempts to dismiss people’s very real concerns about corruption in Washington. Instead of validating those concerns and attempting to address them, Hunter feigned incredulity and then accused Trump of ginning them up. Indeed, if this unlikeable figure is at the center of the Ukraine probe, it may very well be a problem for Joe.

Diplomat Testified Obama Admin Orchestrated Ukraine Prosecutor's Ouster,"A top U.S. diplomat and expert on Ukraine testified to Congress yesterday that the Obama administration — with former Vice President Joe Biden as its point man — orchestrated the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating a company connected to the Biden family, sources familiar with the testimony told The Federalist.

The testimony of George Kent, a State Department official who works on the agency’s Ukraine portfolio, directly contradicts claims that the Obama administration was merely following the lead of the so-called international community in demanding the firing of Viktor Shokin, a controversial Ukrainian prosecutor who was reportedly investigating Burisma, a global energy company long suspected of corruption and money laundering. In 2014, Burisma paid Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, tens of thousands of dollars to sit on its board despite the younger Biden’s complete lack of expertise or professional experience running a multi-national oil and gas concern.

Kent told lawmakers on Tuesday that the Obama administration spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine. Kent said the international community — namely the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western nations within the European Union — were deferential to U.S. directives on the matter. At a 2018 event organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Joe Biden — who was tasked by then-President Barack Obama to lead the U.S. government’s efforts in Ukraine — bragged about threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to fire Shokin.

“I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,” Biden said. “I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.”

“I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,’” Biden recalled. “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After Shokin was fired, he was replaced by Yuri Lutsenko, who also has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The Obama administration never demanded Lutsenko’s ouster, despite worries that Lutsenko was similarly corrupt and untrustworthy.

Allies of Biden, who is currently vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, have defended the former vice president from charges of improperly taking official actions that could financially benefit his son by claiming that the international community, rather than Biden and the Obama administration, were behind the efforts to get rid of Shokin. Kent’s testimony, however, indicates it was Biden and the Obama administration who were running the show, not the so-called international community.

Kent also testified that concerns about corruption within Burisma, where Hunter Biden inexplicably served as a highly paid board member for five years, were openly voiced long before Trump became president. According to Kent, he personally raised red flags about a 2016 initiative between the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Burisma due to concerns the company was tied to government corruption in the country. Kent testified that USAID was gearing up for an event with Burisma that involved children, and that he felt uncomfortable seeing children used as photo op props for a company with a reputation for corruption and graft.

Kent’s testimony was demanded by House Democrats as part of their long-running attempts to overturn the 2016 election results and remove Trump from office. Although Democrats claim their hearings are part of a formal impeachment investigation, party leaders have steadfastly refused to hold a vote on the matter authorizing an impeachment investigation. As a result, numerous top Trump administration officials have refused to appear before the Democratic inquisition, citing a lack of legal authority for Democrats’ efforts.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/16/top-diplomat-testified-that-obama-admin-not-international-community-orchestrated-ukraine-prosecutors-firing/,2019-10-16
Volker Testimony Destroys Narrative Of Turmoil Following Ukraine Call,"The United States’ former envoy to Ukraine told congressional investigators neither country’s officials were concerned about anything in the July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until a campaign of leaks alleging abuse of power began surfacing in late August. Far from the media-fed narrative of officials being physically shaken by the call, Kurt Volker told lawmakers no one had expressed any concern to him about it, or about later allegations that requests for Ukraine’s help in corruption investigations was improper.

While Volker was tasked with managing the relationship between the Trump administration and the new government in Ukraine, he only heard that the Biden family had been mentioned in the phone call when anti-Trump bureaucrats began leaking classified details of the phone conversation to media outlets in late August.

Volker testified October 3 for nearly 10 hours behind closed doors after resigning his unpaid post as the State Department’s special envoy to Ukraine. Democratic lawmakers leaked portions of his testimony and text messages to paint a misleading narrative that he had confirmed an alleged quid pro quo of military aid for investigation of Ukrainian corruption.

Instead, Volker told lawmakers under oath that he was never asked to do anything wrong by any member of the administration, including President Trump. He further described the relationship with Ukraine as extremely positive and as good as anyone could hope for given the tumult in the region.

The special envoy confirmed that interactions between President Trump’s attorney Rudy Guiliani and the Ukrainian government were made at his behest, in part to improve that relationship and to assuage concerns that the incoming government was as corrupt as previous governments. Volker said he believed that Guiliani had been giving information to Trump that was unduly negative about the current relationship between the two countries and hoped that increased interactions would help Guiliani’s opinion of the new government improve.

While Volker didn’t believe Guiliani should trust the word of former prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko, whom he viewed as self-serving and prone to deception, he did concede that Ukraine’s 2016 election meddling was “plausible.” He further noted that corruption in the country was a legitimate concern given the country’s recent history, adding that when corruption is so widespread, decisions about who to prosecute are inherently political. (He was referring to Ukraine, not the United States.)

Volker confirmed the massive corruption of Burisma, the energy concern that paid Hunter Biden hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on its board despite completely lacking experience or expertise in the industry. He said that Burisma had a long-standing reputation as a corrupt company accused of money laundering. Biden resigned in 2019 shortly before his father Joe Biden announced his 2020 presidential candidacy.

Another top U.S. diplomat testified on Tuesday that he was similarly concerned about ongoing corruption with the Ukrainian oil and gas conglomerate.

Volker was somewhat uninformed about Ukraine’s role in helping Hillary Clinton campaign against Trump in 2016. Nellie Ohr, the spouse of a top Department of Justice official, admitted under oath that Serhiy Leshchenko, one of the Ukrainian officials, worked with Fusion GPS, which was secretly funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee to collect dirt that could be used against Trump during the 2016 campaign. Ukrainian courts have determined that Ukrainian government officials worked with Democratic operatives in the United States to release derogatory information about the Trump campaign in a bid to affect election results.

Volker detailed negotiations following the phone call of what would be necessary to assure a White House visit between the two world leaders. Guiliani thought it important that Ukraine’s 2016 election meddling and Burisma specifically be mentioned, while Volker thought a generic commitment to root out corruption, such as the ones previously offered, would be sufficient.

While critics have alleged that the elapse of time before the meeting is unusual, Volker testified it was completely normal and matched his experience in the Bush administration. He reiterated that he was pleased with the progress of the relationship before the anti-Trump leak campaign surrounding the July 25 phone call began in earnest in late August.

Volker was spotted on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, where he was reported to be reviewing a transcript of his testimony.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/16/volker-testimony-destroys-narrative-of-diplomatic-turmoil-following-ukraine-phone-call/,2019-10-16
Hemingway: Media Is Willfully Misunderstanding The Ukraine Story,"Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway appeared on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday morning to explain how the media is repeating the same mistakes they made in covering Russian interference in the 2016 election when it comes to their coverage of impeachment and Trump’s call to Ukraine.

“With the media, you had them for years botch this Russia hoax story. … They never admitted their errors, which made it easier for them to repeat those same errors as they are now pushing this Ukraine story,” Hemingway said.

Hemingway emphasized that there is a significant story with Ukraine that should be investigated, one of the same caliber of collusion that the media has insisted for years would mean removal from office.

“You have people who have already admitted that people affiliated with the Ukrainian government worked with the Democratic National Committee’s contractors to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign,” she said.

“We still don’t have really good answers about how this was able to be weaponized by the U.S. government. … We have a lot to learn, but unfortunately we have a media that suggest learning anything about this is something we can’t do after spending years pushing this false and dangerous conspiracy theory of Russia collusion.”

Hemingway cited the coverage of Mick Mulvaney’s press conference last week as the latest example of media malpractice, noting how they misinterpreted what he was saying about the complex issue of giving taxpayer money to corrupt countries such as Ukraine.

“I’m not saying he wasn’t confusing, but it requires the media to not be so reflexively hostile and actually try to understand the situation,” she said. “They don’t want to look into the Ukraine story because they got the Russia story wrong. It is embarrassing to the media how much they botched this. It is a level of self-preservation for themselves that makes them completely incapable of handling this story.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/22/hemingway-media-is-willfully-misunderstanding-whats-going-on-with-ukraine/,2019-10-22
CNN Failed To Disclose Biden Apologist's Burisma Business Ties,"In a recent television interview, CNN brought on a former U.S. diplomat in Ukraine to assert that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had done nothing wrong in threatening to withhold U.S aid until a Ukrainian prosecutor was fired. What CNN failed to disclose was that John Herbst, the former diplomat interviewed by CNN anchor Kate Bolduan, had a significant conflict of interest regarding Burisma, the controversial Ukrainian gas concern that was reportedly being investigated by the prosecutor whose firing Biden had demanded.

Herbst currently runs the Eurasia Center for the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy-focused tax-exempt organization that is funded in part by Burisma. According to the Atlantic Council’s web page, Burisma donated as much as $250,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2018 alone.

During his interview with CNN, Herbst claimed that Biden was merely following the lead of various international partners in demanding the firing of Viktor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor general at the time. However, in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, State Department official George Kent told lawmakers that the international community deferred to U.S. leadership on the matter.

As The Federalist reported last week, Kent told lawmakers that the Obama administration spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine. Kent said international players — namely the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western nations within the European Union — were deferential to U.S. directives on the matter.

At a 2018 event organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Joe Biden — who was tasked by then-President Barack Obama to lead the U.S. government’s efforts in Ukraine — bragged about threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to fire Shokin.

“I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,” Biden said. “I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.”

“I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,’” Biden recalled. “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After Shokin was fired, he was replaced by Yuri Lutsenko, who also has been dogged by allegations of corruption.

Despite having zero experience in global energy markets or business management, Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, was selected to join Burisma’s board in 2014. Various reports indicate that the younger Biden was paid more than $80,000 a month for nearly five years to sit on Burisma’s board. Shortly after Biden and a family friend were added to the Burisma board, the gas giant hired John Kerry’s former chief of staff David Leiter to lobby Congress and the executive branch, federal records show.

In May 2019, Burisma and the Atlantic Council jointly hosted a cyber-security event in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Herbst organized and spoke at the Burisma-sponsored event, which included guided tours of Burisma’s energy facilities in the country. A local Ukrainian television network captured both Herbst and former Mitt Romney advisor and Burisma board member Joseph Cofer Black singing the company’s praises.

Clad in a Burisma jacket and standing in front of a Burisma mural, Black referred to Burisma’s business as a “blessing.” Footage of the event shows that Herbst was at one point seated directly next to Ukraine gas executive and Burisma board advisor Vadym Pozharskyi. It is unclear why an event ostensibly devoted to the topic of cyber-security necessitated guided tours of Burisma gas facilities.

It was not the first time Herbst paraded before cameras to promote Burisma. During another Burisma-sponsored event in April 2018, Herbst donned a Burisma jacket and hat, stepped in front of a Burisma mural at a Burisma gas facility, and praised the company, which has been dogged for years by allegations of corruption and money-laundering. Two separate clips of Herbst were uploaded to YouTube by Burisma.

“Super-deep drilling is taking place here,” Herbst said, according to a translation. “That is why such a powerful machine is needed.”

“The fact that they brought this equipment — I would say it stands to credit both the Burisma company and the whole Ukraine,” Herbst gushed. “I am impressed by this technology and the way it is implemented here.”

According to a Google translation of Herbst’s remarks, as transcribed in a Burisma press release, Herbst referred to the company as “awe-inspring.”

Both Herbst and Black, the former Romney adviser-turned-Burisma board member, were featured as speakers at a Burisma-sponsored energy conference in Monaco in 2017, according to the official web page promoting the event. The conference, known as the Energy Security Forum, was founded in 2016 by the president of Burisma.

Herbst did not respond to a request for comment about his relationship with Burisma or why he failed to disclose the conflict-of-interest during his CNN interview.

GOP Can Fight Anti-Trump Coup Or Surrender Government To Democrats,"The 2000 presidential election day ended without a clear winner between Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. It all came down to Florida, which was too close to call. State law required close contests to go through a recount, and some counties handled it better than others.

Miami-Dade County was identified by Democrats as a county where Gore could pick up new votes in a recount. Although state law required full recount of the county’s 654,000 ballots, the Democrat-controlled canvassers instead focused on 10,750 ballots that had been rejected for one reason or another or where no clear pick could be identified for president.

Then the canvassers tried to determine “intent” using their own subjective feelings. For instance, if a voter had by and large picked Democrats for other seats, or if a canvasser could claim he saw an indentation where the chad could have been punched out for Gore, they would count that as a Gore vote. They didn’t recount Cuban-American precincts that overwhelmingly went for Bush and where he might pick up new votes.

The situation was bad enough for Republicans, but then the canvassers decided to move the process to a closed room and restricted media access to 25 feet away. Republicans were livid.

Rep. John Sweeney, a Republican congressman from New York, told a staffer to “shut it down” and dozens of Republican activists began causing a ruckus, pounding on the doors and shouting at the canvassers to stop their blatant attempts to push Gore into the lead. (The New York Times was forced to admit that Bush was the winner of the election and would have been named so even if Democrats had won some of their challenges.)

The media were outraged. “Right-Wingers Praise Antics of Bush Thugs,” wrote Joe Conason, calling it a “lawless… white riot” and incitement of a “mob.” President Bush and other leaders were criticized for not speaking against the “disgrace done in their campaign’s name.” What’s worse, Bush and his vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney joked about it at a local hotel. The mob “lent a touch of racial irony” to Republican criticism of Jesse Jackson’s protests in Miami at the same time.

Timothy Noah demanded action against Sweeney, for his role in the “siege of Miami” and “Miami mayhem,” which, he said, was “possibly” against the law. Time’s Tim Padgett wrote of the “Mob Scene in Miami,” calling it a “GOP melee.” He claimed that Americans were horrified to witness the “strong-arm tactics in what was supposed to be a showcase of democracy in action.” He quoted a Democratic chairman saying that the Republicans were using “Brownshirt tactics.”

The media attacks were written, not coincidentally, after the mini-protest was shown to have worked. Within hours, the Democrat-led board admitted that they couldn’t comply with state law by the Sunday deadline and stopped their attempted vote harvesting scheme. Sweeney was later nicknamed “Congressman Kick-Ass” by President George W. Bush.

If all this sounds similar to what some House Republicans did to Rep. Adam Schiff’s star chamber inquisition this week on Capitol Hill, that’s because it is similar. Showing up in mass at the location where Schiff runs his show, they sought access to House records that were denied to them by a Democrat majority intent on keeping the public in the dark, exposing the farce of what the media describe as an impeachment inquiry.

Lay Down or Fight

Republicans have two choices for how to handle the Resistance’s latest attempt to undo the 2016 election through dramatic means. They can sit there and take it, or they can fight it.

Some Republicans can be counted on to sit there and take it. This approach entails allowing Democrats to hold secret hearings where they handpick snippets to leak to a compliant media in service of setting a narrative. After the leaks are published by the compliant corporate press, these Republicans can impotently push back on some of it.

The other approach is to learn something from the previous few years. Trump’s surprising election was followed by attempts to delegitimize the Republican victory in 2016 by claiming it was due to “fake news,” desperate efforts to overturn the Electoral College, anti-Trump riots in Portland and D.C., the Clinton-directed claims that Russia “hacked” the election, the Russia collusion conspiracy theory, the release of the completely ridiculous dossier alleging that Trump was a Russian agent, the whisper campaign that the truth of Trump’s collusion was so bad that he might not be inaugurated. Yes, all this was before the inauguration.

Within minutes of the inauguration, the Washington Post published that the “campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.” The primary impeachment effort was the Russia collusion hoax, in which the Resistance embraced — or pretended to believe — a patently absurd theory that Trump is a secret Russian agent who stole the 2016 election in a brazen act of sedition.

Corporate media outlets published and broadcast story after story supporting this theory, which was later shown to have been invented and secretly funded as a Clinton campaign operation alongside the Democratic National Committee. Foreign policy was put on hold, key administration advisors were fired and sidelined, investigations into whether former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions was a Russian spy were launched. Following the firing of the mendacious and corrupt James Comey as FBI director, the Resistance forced the launch of an intrusive and unstoppable special counsel probe, ostensibly headed by Robert Mueller.

Years later — after the special counsel had stymied the Trump administration, fed the collusion conspiracy theory, rung up Trump associates for process crimes, and destroyed the lives and bank accounts of many Trump associates — the probe ended with not a single American, much less a single American tied to the Trump campaign, much less Trump himself, found to have colluded with Russia.

Just Keep Throwing Crap Until Something Sticks

So then the goalposts moved once again. The argument went that Trump, by being upset that he was falsely accused of being a traitor who stole the 2016 election by colluding with Russia, might have “obstructed justice.” Team Mueller couldn’t say, exactly. A report — clearly designed to be an impeachment report — was transmitted to Congress to get things going.

But then Mueller testified before Congress and demonstrated that he had very little understanding of the probe that bore his name. Mueller’s role had been used by the Resistance to silence any criticism of the probe or the Russia collusion theory in general. As soon as it was obvious to the world that he had not really participated in the probe so much as been its titular head, the goalposts moved again.

Following a few returning visits to the 25th Amendment fever swamps, where Resistance members fantasize that they could get Trump’s cabinet to undo the 2016 election, or speculation that Trump might resign, they have landed on something something Ukraine.

Corporate media is trying to spin the Ukraine story as if it is something other than what it is. As if it were legitimate and quickly moving. Mike Allen of Axios opined of impeachment that “It’s remarkable how fast it has gotten off the ground. You can see how quickly the Ukraine phone call came out of nowhere to become the all-consuming impeachment topic — way faster than the impeachment inquiries into Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.”

Yes, this is a really good talking point if you ignore literally everything that has happened since November 8, 2016.

Again Republicans can either follow the Resistance, including Democrats and their corporate media supporters, or they can choose not acquiesce to the latest efforts to undo the 2016 election but somehow fight them.

Just as in 2000, the media screeching over Rep. Matt Gaetz and his colleagues fighting the secret efforts — which are literally being led by a man who lied to the public for years, falsely claiming he held evidence of Trump’s treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election — is not an objection to what Gaetz and his colleagues did but anger that some Republicans have the audacity to fight back against what Democrats and the corporate media are doing. Complaints about decorum and process in 2000 were likewise complaints that Republicans weren’t sitting there and allowing Democrats to steal an election George W. Bush had rightfully won.

Using Bureaucracy to Overturn Elections Is Dangerous

Efforts to steal an election in 2000 or overturn one from 2016 should be met not with passive compliance but a righteous defense of the ballot box. And the Resistance members, whether in the bureaucracy, Congress, media, or the NeverTrump movement, need to know that they are playing with fire by trying to get around the ballot box.

Despite the belief of many career bureaucrats that elected political leadership works for them, our system is built on the idea that the permanent bureaucracy, such as it exists, works for the elected leadership, which in turn works for and represents the American public. While it is tempting to look at the three-year-long temper tantrum from the Resistance as being entirely about Trump, it’s about something much bigger. It is about whether our elected government serves the people or whether it exists to do the bidding of a cabal of unelected, taxpayer-funded bureaucrats and smug partisans of the corporate media.

At some point it won’t just be marches on Capitol Hill from a few Republican congressmen that the Resistance will have to deal with. It is unclear what the proper reaction to an unrelenting campaign to overturn the result of the 2016 election should be exactly, but they should stop expecting people to be as polite as they have been in response.

What we are facing now is not partisan warfare, it’s not a mystery novel, it’s not politics-as-usual. We are facing an attempt to tear down the foundations of our republic by corrupt, unelected bureaucrats who have decided the will of voters is subordinate to their will to power. It represents a fatal threat to our system of government, and if this coup succeeds — whether through impeachment proceedings, or through an election that (if the last three years are any indication) the other side is clearly willing to steal by hook or by crook — the nation will cease to be a constitutional, democratic republic.

This isn’t about Trump, or Republicans, or conservatives. It is about Washington needing to learn that political differences have to be settled at the ballot box lest they instead be settled with an undermining of our constitutional norms and institutions.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/25/gop-has-a-choice-fight-anti-trump-coup-effort-or-surrender-government-to-democrats/,2019-10-25
"Trump Is Right To Fight Impeachment On The Merits, Not The Process","When I was a teenager, I played basketball. I was a two guard, and one of my defensive tricks was to feint with my left hand at the opposing guard’s right dribble and then try to flick the ball away behind his back with my left when he turned away. One game the whistle blew, foul on me. I turned to the ref and said, “I never touched him.” The ref said, “Yeah, but you were going to.” I objected to this nonsense vociferously enough that I spent the rest of the game in the locker room.

This is essentially what is happening to Donald Trump in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry. The central allegation against the president is that he told President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that if he didn’t investigate Joe Biden’s son, his country would not receive the funding Congress had approved. Much like my phantom foul, what Democrats are alleging against the president flat-out didn’t happen, even if he wanted it to.

Today Trump scolded the Republicans on Capitol Hill, telling them to stop engaging in a fight over the process of impeachment and start fighting on the merits. He’s exactly right. “Quid pro quo” has become the mantra of the mainstream media — “this for that.” But “this,” the aid to Ukraine, flowed without “that,” the investigation into Hunter Biden, being promised. So what exactly is the problem here?

Democrats would have us believe the problem is that Trump wanted a quid pro quo. So what? Did he float the idea to his advisers? Maybe. Did he say, “Hey, I’ve got some questions about Ukraine: Is it rife with corruption? Is Europe paying its fair share to defend it? Did it give Joe Biden’s son a pass?” At this point, career officials got nervous. Presidents aren’t supposed to ask questions like this. They are just supposed to hold state dinners and let unelected officials do their jobs.

So let’s ask ourselves a question. Why do Democrats in Congress want so much access into the decision-making process behind releasing — again, emphasis on releasing — aid to Ukraine? The answer is pretty simple. The transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky makes it as clear as the summer sun that at no point did Trump directly tie aid to investigating Hunter Biden. The alleged crime never happened, but did Trump want it to?

Here it is reasonable for people on all sides to admit that Trump might have wanted something to happen that was unethical and illegal. It’s not the first time. When Trump wanted his counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, he was told he couldn’t do that. And he didn’t. There is a reason that a president, especially one without political or legal experience — perhaps elected because he didn’t have legal or political experience — has advisers and lawyers. He asks questions, and they give answers. Isn’t that what supposedly happened here?

The bottom line is that Donald Trump did not do the thing Democrats want to say he did. He released the aid. That is why he is absolutely correct in wanting to fight the case, not the process. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, CNN, and the harpies of the Never Trump movement might want to bemoan that a president would even consider what Trump considered. But who cares? It didn’t happen.

What did happen is what is supposed to happen: The president sought advice, received it, and acted accordingly. Ukraine got its aid, and all lived happily ever after except for Democrats, embarrassed by the failure of the Mueller investigation and desperate for some pretext to impeach a duly elected president.

The only law that was broken here was the unwritten law that unelected diplomatic officials get to determine United States foreign policy without accountability to voters. That kind of unwritten law is exactly what Donald Trump was elected to undo. This is why he wants to fight on merits and why Republicans should be on board for that fight.

There was no crime here. Let me say that again — there was no crime here. There were conversations that made unelected people uncomfortable. Well, Trump was at least in part elected to make unelected people feel uncomfortable. Just like my fake foul so many years ago, the Democrats are seeing what they want to see, not what is there. But unlike me, the president will not be ejected. Rather, he will continue the game stronger than ever.

Biden's New Super PAC Is Run By A Foreign Government Agent,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has a brand new Super PAC in his corner, and it’s being run by a registered foreign agent for the government of Azerbaijan. Larry Rasky, a lobbyist who previously worked as a top campaign operative for Biden, is listed as the treasurer of the PAC, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

“A former Joe Biden aide has filed paperwork to form a super PAC, called Unite the Country, that is set to boost the former vice president with millions of dollars in spending in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary,” Politico reported on Tuesday.

Records filed with the Department of Justice show that Rasky is also a registered foreign agent lobbying on behalf of the government of Azerbaijan. The records, which were filed pursuant to the Foreign Agent Registration Act, show that Rasky was hired by the Azerbaijani government on April 23, 2019. Federal documents signed by Rasky show that he reports directly to Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan’s ambassador to the United States.

“[The government of Azerbaijan] will pay RASKY a minimum monthly non-refundable fee (the ‘Monthly Fee’) for the Services provided of $15,000 per month, plus a 5% administrative fee as described below,” Rasky’s contract with the foreign government states. “The Monthly Fees totaling $94,500 shall be paid in two equal installments. The initial payment of $47,250 is due upon the signing of this agreement. The second payment of $47,250 is due on July 15, 2019.”

Rasky changed the name of the PAC from “For The People” to “Unite the Country” on Monday, according to FEC filings. The filings do not state which country Rasky intends to unite on Biden’s behalf.

Politico reported in August that Rasky also explored going into business with Hunter Biden and James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother. At one point, Rasky planned to provide a million dollars towards the Bidens’ purchase of Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund.

“James and Hunter brought in Larry Rasky, a lobbyist and longtime Biden adviser, who at one point, according to court records, was going to provide $1 million in financing,” Politico reported. “Rasky did not respond to a request for comment.”

Biden’s campaign has been dogged by allegations that he corruptly used his influence as vice president to steer lucrative foreign business contracts to his son Hunter. At a 2018 event organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Joe Biden — who was tasked by then-President Barack Obama to lead the U.S. government’s efforts in Ukraine — bragged about threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating a gas company that paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars to sit on its board.

“I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,” Biden said. “I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.”

“I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,’” Biden recalled. “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After Shokin was fired, he was replaced by Yuri Lutsenko, who also has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The Obama administration never demanded Lutsenko’s ouster, despite worries that Lutsenko was similarly corrupt and untrustworthy.

In recent congressional testimony, George Kent, a State Department official who works on the agency’s Ukraine portfolio, contradicted claims that the Obama administration was merely following the lead of the so-called international community in demanding the firing of Shokin. As The Federalist previously reported, Kent told lawmakers the Obama administration spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine. Kent said the international community — namely the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western nations within the European Union — were deferential to U.S. directives on the matter.

The news that Biden’s Super PAC is run by the agent of a foreign government will likely complicate the former vice president’s efforts blunt the narrative that his government duties are for sale.

Azerbaijan is not the only foreign entity that Rasky has recently represented. He and his firm also lobbied on behalf of a Bangladeshi political party through January of 2019.

“Rasky Partners will engage in message development, outreach to influencers, media monitoring, media relations, strategic counsel and research,” the filing declared. Rasky’s firm received more than $86,000 from that contract, federal records show.

A previous firm run by Rasky also represented foreign officials in Japan, Hungary, Congo, and Serbia.

On Wednesday, Rasky told The Federalist that, notwithstanding the previous contract with Azerbaijan filed with DOJ, his firm had terminated its relationship with Azerbaijan effective August 27, 2019. Rasky’s attorney formally filed the termination notice with DOJ the same day.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/29/the-head-of-joe-bidens-new-super-pac-is-a-foreign-government-agent/,2019-10-29
Trump Was Right To Keep The Baghdadi Raid Secret From Schiff,"The latest media freakout over the death of Abu Bakr-al Baghdadi is because Trump failed to disclose information about the raid to the House Intelligence Committee beforehand. Trump alleges the reason he did not inform the committee about the raid is due to his mistrust of the committee’s chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. He called Washington a “leaking machine.”

President Trump is right to worry about leaks. Back in 2017, Gen. Tony Thomas made this very point at the Aspen Security Conference, where he discussed how a prior lead on Abu Bakr al Baghdadi “went dead” following a media leak.

“That was a very good lead. Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,” Thomas explained. “The challenge we have [is] in terms of where and how our tactics and procedures are discussed openly. There’s a great need to inform the American public about what we’re up to. There’s also great need to recognize things that will absolutely undercut our ability to do our job.”

Admittedly, Trump’s labeling of Washington as a “leaking machine” is a revealing and disappointing statement on the federal government, but the blame for this situation does not lie with Trump, and it would require cognitive dissonance of the highest order for the media to blame the president for his recalcitrance to share information with a congressional committee headed by Schiff. Schiff has proven to be a bad faith actor who routinely compromises his integrity in pursuit of partisan gains.

For military operations, it is good habit to inform leaders of Congress about what is occurring, but it’s not legally required, as might be had this been a covert intelligence operation. Given Schiff’s behavior, perhaps Trump’s call not to inform him was a judicious one.

Schiff has spent the vast majority of Trump’s presidency peddling unfounded (and debunked) conspiracy theories and “leaking” false information to countless media outlets in the hopes of forwarding the Democratic #Resistance narrative. So it is entirely unsurprising that Trump would experience some trepidation about sharing highly sensitive information with Schiff.

Just Remember What Schiff Did With the Ukraine Call

Schiff’s behavior directly preceding the Trump impeachment inquiry has been salacious, at best. Schiff lied about the nature of President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by fabricating details that did not actually transpire, including sharing that President Trump had requested Zelensky generate incriminating evidence against former Vice President Joe Biden.

As we all could ascertain from the transcript, this request never took place. When confronted about his lies, Schiff dismissed the critiques, simply claiming the story was his “parody” of an extremely contentious event. After being attacked for such unseriousness, Schiff then tweeted two days later that the anonymous whistleblower had “confirmed” these allegations, although no such allegations appear in the whistleblower’s nine-page complaint. These circus-like maneuvers are the not the machinations of a serious individual, and anyone who attempts to market them as such is deluding himself.

In addition to falsifying information about Trump’s phone call with Zelensky, Schiff also claimed that no prior communication had taken place with the whistleblower prior to the formal complaint’s filing. That, too, proved to be a lie, as reported by The New York Times.

Schiff’s dishonest maneuvers in the Trump-Ukraine matter are just the latest in a series of mendacious activities that seriously call his credibility into question, enough to justify Trump’s hesitance to share sensitive national security information with the arguably disreputable congressman.

There’s a Lot More in Schiff’s Record of Unreliability

A few weeks ago, the Washington Times published a helpful list detailing some of Schiff’s legitimately sketchy, for lack of a better word, behavior. During the Trump-Russia investigation, Schiff used the now-disgraced Steele dossier to buttress his line of questioning when interrogating FBI Director James Comey in a March 2017 hearing. He granted legitimacy to a document that should never have been granted legitimacy, and by doing so, engaged in the very act he accused the Trump campaign of—gratifying foreign interference in our elections.

Even when Schiff had the opportunity to “make good” on his reliance on the Steele dossier, he refused the opportunity. In early 2018, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., then chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, published a memo alleging that the FBI had possibly used biased sources, like the Steele dossier, when it obtained a FISA warrant to spy on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

In a “countermemo” published in response, Schiff alleged that the supposed “evidence” from the Steele dossier could not have been used to garner approval for a year’s worth of wiretaps on Page since Bruce Ohr from the Justice Department did not approach the FBI with information from the infamous dossier until November 2016. The wiretap was application was finalized in October. This, too, was false. Ohr had been forwarding information from the dossier to the FBI’s Andrew McCabe all the way back in the summer of 2016.

Schiff’s “countermemo” also alleged that Nunes had made a “midnight run” to gather documents from the White House that would show conspiratorial aims from the Obama administration. This, too, was false. Nunes appeared on-air with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer to set the record straight about his trip to the White House, which occurred in the middle of the day and involved a visit with a national security staffer.

Prior to the release of Nunes’ memo, Schiff alleged that the push from the public to see the memo was the result of a Russia bot operation, not genuine interest from Americans to understand how corrupt Democrat leadership had become. This, too, was false. Twitter conducted an in-house analysis, determining that the source of the #ReleaseTheMemo hashtag was mostly Americans.

Schiff Is Not Just a Liar, But a Leaky Liar

Schiff routinely capitalizes on the fact that the mainstream media is largely in the left’s pocket and will unquestioningly publish what helps the Democrats. But beyond Schiff’s blatantly dishonest tactics, he likely has a penchant for leaking information to the press, sometimes inaccurate, to advance the Democrats’ narrative.

Hearken back to March 2017, when the media breathlessly published during Donald Trump Jr.’s House Intelligence Committee hearing that the president’s son had received a decryption key from WikiLeaks to access hacked Democratic National Committee emails, legitimizing Democrats’ claims of collusion. Yet the timestamp on the email had been doctored to an earlier date to imply collusion, when in fact it had been sent well after WikiLeaks had begun dumping DNC emails in public. It was merely an email from an unknown sender inviting the recipient to inspect what WikiLeaks had already uploaded onto the internet.

Given that the House Intelligence Committee were the ones with access to Trump Jr.’s emails, it’s highly probable that someone within the committee “leaked” the email to various sources within the media. It’s also why many Republicans suspect Schiff, chairman of the committee, to be the leaker.

All Republicans on Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence wasted no time in calling for Schiff’s resignation in March after the Mueller report found no evidence of the collusion Schiff had been dangerously peddling for the past two years on every major news network in a desperate attempt to maintain relevancy. An excerpt from the committee’s letter elucidated:

Your repeated public statements, which implied knowledge of classified facts supporting the collusion allegations, occurred at the same time anonymous leaks of alleged intelligence and law enforcement information were appearing in the media. These leaks, often sourced to current or former Administration or intelligence officials, appeared to support the collusion allegations and were purported to be related to ongoing investigations of President Trump and his associates.

Fast-forward to the latest Trump-Ukraine affair. Schiff mysteriously announced in a press release an investigation into Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, two days before supposedly receiving the whistleblower’s complaint, suggesting that he possibly was using insider information when calling for copies of the transcripts from the phone call. Schiff’s representative did not comment when asked to explain this absurd coincidence. All this proves it’s definitely worth questioning Schiff’s capacity to handle sensitive information without leaping on it for partisan gain.

The House was recently given an opportunity to chastise Schiff for this pattern of reckless behavior, and chose not to. That left Trump with denying him the opportunity to leak this raid before it happened like he’d done so many times before. Whether we like it or not, choices have consequences. One of those consequences is a breakdown of trust between the House and the executive branch, one that we hold dear and one that House Democrats have seemingly sacrificed on the sacred altar of the Resistance.

If Democrats in the House are so concerned with the sharing of information between the executive branch and the House, perhaps when one of their members engages in inexcusable and unethical behavior, they should reprimand that individual, not celebrate him as some heroic figure worthy of emulation. It only suggests tacit support of the very behavior that every government official, right or left, should be condemning.

"Anti-Trump 'Whistleblower' Worked With DNC Operatives, Joe Biden","A new report from RealClearInvestigations reveals that the anti-Trump “whistleblower” who prompted the current impeachment proceedings against President Trump is a registered Democrat who worked with a Democratic National Committee opposition researcher who dug up dirt on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.

Federal documents reveal that the whistleblower, Eric Ciaramella, previously worked in the Obama administration with former Vice President Joe Biden and former CIA Director John Brennan. RealClear reports that Ciaramella remained there into the Trump administration, and headed the Ukraine desk at the National Security Council, eventually transitioning into the West Wing, until June 2017.

He then “left his National Security Council posting in the White House’s West Wing in mid-2017 amid concerns about negative leaks to the media. He has since returned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia,” RealClearInvestigations reported. Ciaramella is a Yale graduate who reportedly speaks Russian, Ukrainian, and Arabic.

Officials told RealClear that Ciaramella strongly opposed Trump’s foreign policy.

“He didn’t exactly hide his passion with respect to what he thought was the right thing to do with Ukraine and Russia, and his views were at odds with the president’s policies,” a former senior White House official said.

Politico reported on a Ukrainian-American woman who consulted for the Democratic National Committee, and “met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia.” The woman, Alexandra Chalupa, was paid $412,000 from 2004 to June 2016 by the DNC.

Ciaramella invited Chalupa to meetings and events at the White House, RealClear reported, documents confirming one occasion in November 2015. She also visited the White House with Ukrainian lobbyists seeking aid from Obama.

Chalupa said she shared her findings with both the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Politico reports that “Chalupa told a senior DNC official that, when it came to Trump’s campaign, ‘I felt there was a Russia connection.'” Chalupa also said that the Ukrainian embassy worked directly with reporters digging for Trump-Russia ties.

Before Ciaramella filed his “whistleblower complaint,” he sought “guidance” from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s staff and other Obama-era NSC staff recently employed by Schiff’s office. Before this “guidance” was public knowledge, the Chairman was adamant on hearing the “whistleblower” testimony.

“We need to speak with the whistleblower,” Schiff and other Democrats proclaimed. As soon as Ciaramella’s partisanship and collaboration was discovered, Schiff and the Democrats flipped to preventing the testimony from happening and moving their hearings behind closed doors.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/30/anti-trump-whistleblower-worked-with-dnc-operative-who-sought-dirt-on-trump-from-ukrainian-officials/,2019-10-30
Democrats Retreat From Subpoenas To Schedule Impeachment Vote,"Almost six weeks into the Ukraine impeachment farce, Democrats find themselves maneuvering into a “strategic repositioning” (translation: “retreat”). One of the “main talking points to rebut impeachment,” as the Washington Post characterized it, is that the “House Democrats’ inquiry isn’t legitimate because the members didn’t vote to start one.” A “talking point” is what corporate media calls an argument for which it has no ready response.

The Post article cited a Democrat House aide who said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has no intention of taking a vote, no matter what demands President Trump makes. This aide called the “full vote” argument “pathetic” and “bogus.”

Pelosi doesn’t need a full house vote, Ramsey Touchberry insisted in in Newsweek. Legal experts assured Touchberry, “President Trump is wrong in saying that it is not a legitimate impeachment inquiry without a floor vote.”

The New York Times “fact checked” the claim that past presidential impeachment inquiries have always started with a House vote, writing, “This is misleading. Though the full chamber voted to start impeachment inquiries against Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon, nothing in the Constitution or House rules requires it.” “Misleading” is code for “true but we don’t want it to be.”

Well, well, well. The Democrats have “Schifted” course and now say they plan to hold a formal impeachment vote this week. The purpose of the vote will be to establish rules (there have been none thus far) under which the inquiry, now six weeks old, may proceed. In a completely related announcement, “House Democrats will forgo using the federal courts to try to compel testimony from recalcitrant witnesses in their impeachment inquiry.”

Why are the two announcements related? Recall what I wrote when the farce began: “Congress’s authority to request documents [and subpoena witnesses] is dependent on whether it has a legitimate legislative purpose for the documents. The purpose of the House invoking the phrase ‘impeachment inquiry’ is to create a pretext to argue in court that it has a right to the documents.”

But, as I predicted, “The absence of a declaration by the full House sets up the argument for the president that this ‘inquiry’ is a mere political stunt by a rogue committee and not a legitimate legislative purpose endorsed by the full House.”

Like many retreats, this one is marked by chaos and confusion. Politico bemoaned, “Democrats’ internal squabbles overshadow damning testimony.” The author added, “the impeachment obsession on Capitol Hill — in the media, within the GOP, and even among vulnerable members of their own caucus — ended up turning the resolution into a glaring example of Democrats’ messaging struggles on impeachment.”

Indeed, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer refused to commit to a Thursday vote as he might not have the votes then to proceed. As noted by Sean Davis, the proposed resolution attempts to retroactively stuff the genie back in the bottle-referring to the “ongoing investigations into whether sufficient grounds exist to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach…the President.”

So now Democrats are now abandoning any effort to seek court enforcement of past subpoenas issued under Rep. Adam Schiff’s Ukraine charade? It’s hard to argue the inquiry has a “legitimate legislative purpose” when the only three votes on impeaching President Trump have all gone against impeachment.

“We are not willing to let the White House engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts, so we press ahead,” Schiff told reporters. It’s a rope-a-dope that Schiff now appears to concede he would lose. So instead of enforcing the subpoenas, Schiff is simply going to make up what the information would have been.

In legal phraseology, this is called, “drawing an adverse inference,” a practice borrowed from civil litigation in which a judge responds to the unauthorized withholding of evidence by instructing jurors “that they can presume the missing evidence would have been bad for the side that didn’t provide it.” This notwithstanding the fact that an Obama-appointed judge has ruled the voteless impeachment inquiry to be a valid exercise of House power for a legislative purpose. But Schiff appears to understand that this victory cannot weather the appeal process.

Impeaching and removing the president requires bipartisan support. One can practically hear Schiff stomp his foot in frustration: “What I find harder to understand is why the Republican members of this body in this House don’t want these witnesses to come forward…Where is their duty to this institution? Where is their duty to the Constitution? Where is their respect for the rule of law?”

Where, one might ask, is Schiff’s bipartisanship in the investigation of the origins of the Russia collusion hoax, of which he recently said, “[Attorney General] Bill Barr, on the president’s behalf, is weaponizing the Justice Department to go after the president’s enemies. He’s demonstrating once again that he is merely a tool of the president, the president’s hand, not the representative of the American people.”

Never mind that the collusion hoaxsters “weaponized the Justice Department to go after political enemies” by repeatedly illegally leaking classified information, unmasking American targets of warrantless surveillance, and spying on a presidential campaign. Should a Constitution-loving lawmaker insist upon consequences to bureaucrats who lawlessly abused law enforcement and intelligence powers for political advantage? According to the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, the answer “Schifts” depending on the team with which the misfeasors align.

Another prediction of mine is now proving true: the Ukraine hoax has not brought down Joe Biden, as his critics might have hoped. As I wrote before, “One thing that Trump has proven in the last five years is that bad media publicity has a way of helping the target in a primary contest because it starves his competitors of attention.”

Schiff is sucking all of the oxygen out of the Democratic primary process, which is locking in Biden’s name-recognition advantage. As I predicted, the scandal has not tanked Biden’s numbers and has repressed the competition other than Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. If Democrats are unhappy with that outcome, they know where to Schift the blame.

One final note: The voters, particularly the independent voters, are not sold on the impeachment project. According to a jaw-dropping Suffolk University/USA Today poll, only 36 percent of voters think the president should be impeached, and 37 percent think Congress should drop impeachment. If only Democrats would listen to their voters. We might be able to move on to solving real problems that face our country.

NSC Official Tim Morrison To Schiff: Nothing Illegal In Trump-Zelensky Call,"A top National Security Council (NSC) official who listened to President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky testified to Congress today that he did not believe Trump had discussed anything illegal during the conversation.

“I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed,” former NSC Senior Director for European Affairs Tim Morrison testified today, according to a record of his remarks obtained by The Federalist.

Morrison testified that Ukrainian officials were not even aware that certain military funding had been delayed by the Trump administration until late August 2019, more than a month after the Trump-Zelensky call, casting doubt on allegations that Trump somehow conveyed an illegal quid pro quo demand during the July 25 call.

“I have no reason to believe the Ukrainians had any knowledge of the [military funding] review until August 28, 2019,” Morrison said. That is the same day that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chief anti-Trump inquisitor in the U.S. House of Representatives, disclosed on Twitter that funding had been held up. Politico also published a story that day, sourced to anonymous leaks, that military funding had been temporarily held up.

Although Schiff claimed that neither he nor his staff ever spoke to the anti-Trump whistleblower, The New York Times reported that the complainant, whom RealClearInvestigations identified as Eric Ciaramella, coordinated with Schiff’s office before filing his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general on August 12. While Schiff initially demanded that the anti-Trump complainant be allowed to publicly testify, he quickly changed course following the reports that he and his staff had secretly colluded with the whistleblower and then lied about the interactions.

Morrison also pointed out key factual inaccuracies in testimony provided by William Taylor, a State Department official who works in the U.S. embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. Morrison said that, contrary to Taylor’s claims, Morrison never met with the Ukrainian National Security advisor in his private hotel room.

Morrison also said Taylor falsely claimed that Ambassador Gordon Sondland demanded a public statement from the Ukrainian president committing to investigate Burisma, a controversial Ukrainain energy company that paid Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son Hunter millions of dollars to sit on its board.

“My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland’s proposal to [Ukrainian National Security Advisor Andriy] Yermak was that it could be sufficient if the new Ukrainian prosecutor general — not President Zelensky — would commit to pursue the Burisma investigation,” Morrison testified.

Morrison testified that the transcript of the phone call that was declassified and released by Trump in late September “accurately and completely reflects the substance of the call,” and that he was concerned that the substance of the call would be leaked to the media. Morrison said he immediately informed a NSC lawyer about his concerns that the phone call would be leaked. Democrats have alleged that security measures taken to prevent leaks of the top secret call transcript prove that Trump should be removed from office.

He also told lawmakers that the national security process worked as designed in the case of the military funding that Congress appropriated for Ukraine.

“I am pleased our process gave the president the confidence he needed to approve the release of the security sector assistance,” he said. “I am proud of what I have been able, in some small way, to help the Trump administration accomplish.”

Democrats on Thursday morning voted to rubber-stamp Schiff’s efforts to impeach Trump with secret hearings and lopsided rules that prevent Republicans from subpoenaing witnesses or evidence without first obtaining Schiff’s permisison. A bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans opposed the measure.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/nsc-official-tim-morrison-to-schiff-i-was-not-concerned-that-anything-illegal-was-discussed-in-trump-ukraine-phone-call/,2019-10-31
Alex Vindman’s Impeachment Testimony Rested On His Personal Opinions,"A lot of rhetoric is being thrown around, both in print media and on TV, about Lt. Col. Alex Vindman’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee about President Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine. He has been lauded by Democrats and the press (excuse the redundancy), and most of the commentary and reporting ignores any analysis of his allegations about the call.

In Vindman’s testimony, I see more appeals to emotion than to analysis and reason. For example, he talks about how he served in combat as an infantryman, holds a Purple Heart for wounds, and was an immigrant as a child. I therefore venture this analysis of his prepared statement and whether Vindman “has done nothing more or less than his duty,” as some have suggested, as well as the significance of his highly touted “personal knowledge” of that call.

Because committee Chairman Adam Schiff has kept Vindman’s oral testimony secret, I focus on Vindman’s prepared statement, which is public. I will also address only his testimony about the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky.

All About Vindman’s Opinions, Not the Facts

First, as discussed below, Vindman’s testimony about the July 25 call between the two presidents does not add any new facts. So, what does he say? He offers his opinions about the wisdom of the call. That’s it. His testimony about the substance of that call consists of five sentences at the end of his prepared testimony. Those five sentences basically comprise two opinions.

Here is what he said: “I was concerned by the call. [1] I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine. [2] I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC’s lead counsel.”

The two portions preceded by my bracketed numbers are Vindman’s opinions. Let’s analyze what he said. It is important to remember that he was not speaking off-the-cuff or just responding to questions. This was a carefully prepared opening statement that had been closely vetted by lawyers and others.

Regarding his first opinion, he says, “I did not think it was proper…” That is pure opinion, not fact. Moreover, if it is improper to ask a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen, that would no doubt come as a big surprise to many in government.

Vindman’s statement is, in short, an unfounded and unsupported opinion. And the notion that the president could not properly ask a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen who may have engaged in illegal activity is nonsense; Joe Biden does not get a pass from investigation just because he is candidate for the nomination of his party.

There is nothing improper or illegal about an investigation into potentially illegal actions, much less anything that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor. The notion that it does is so much tommyrot.

So, absent personal knowledge of a high crime or misdemeanor, Vindman’s first personal opinion is immaterial. I think most voters not swirling around in the vortex of Trump hatred care more about the opinions of the president and the secretary of State than those of a mid-level officer, at least on this topic.

Vindman’s second opinion is that if Ukraine investigated the Bidens as President Trump suggested, it would lose the support of Democrats in Congress. That may well be, but in addition to being a personal opinion, it is a pure political concern. It is properly the concern of the presidents of the United States and of Ukraine.

If he disagrees with the president’s approach and harbors a fear that Ukraine will lose Democrat votes if it investigates the Bidens, Vindman’s proper role is to give his best advice and then shut up. His proper role is not to volunteer to go before a congressional committee and complain about why he disagrees with the president.

It’s Not This Guy’s Duty to Second-Guess the President

So, with the understanding that Vindeman’s relevant statements were opinion, not fact, was he merely doing his duty as his officer’s oath demands? Many have relied on the argument that he is not an anti-Trump activist because he was subpoenaed and therefore had no choice but to testify. Thus, his supporters have argued that he did not decide to become involved but was merely a pawn in the political theater, just a honorable soldier doing his duty.

That would be a better argument if Vindman had been subpoenaed involuntarily and then had to give honest answers to factual questions. But that is not what happened. He said he was “appearing today voluntarily pursuant to a subpoena.” Appearing “voluntarily pursuant to a subpoena” is what people do when they are trying to cover their rear end. That is a statement by someone who is willing or affirmatively wants to testify but thinks he needs a subpoena commanding his presence to be able to claim that he had to testify.

Lawyers deal with that every day. The “just doing his duty” argument also is flawed because even if his duty required him to testify about facts (itself a debatable proposition) it did not require him to offer his personal opinions critiquing his commander-in-chief.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, being subpoenaed does not obligate any witness to make an opening statement. That is something they do if they want to. Vindman wanted to; it was a purely voluntary act. That desire to offer his personal opinions to impeach the president’s decisions does indeed support the argument that this officer is an active member of the “resistance.”

We All Have the Same Firsthand Knowledge Now

Second, many have touted Vindman’s “firsthand knowledge” of what was said on the July 25 call, in order to distinguish that “firsthand knowledge” from the allegations by the “whistleblower,” whose “second- or third-hand knowledge” was the catalyst for the present impeachment circus. The anti-Trump media initially ran with that story line and others have fallen into the same trap.

Vindman’s public volunteering of his personal opinions contrary to those of his commander-in-chief violates the fundamental rule that military officers should be publicly apolitical.

It is correct that Vindman has “firsthand knowledge” of the call. However, his personal knowledge of that call is not important. Why not? Because the president released the transcript and we know what was said.

In fact, Vindman’s prepared statement indicates he believes that the released transcript is accurate. He said: “As the transcript is in the public record, we are all aware of what was said.” If Vindman had contended that the transcript was not accurate, then his recollection might be material. But that is not what he claimed.

Although some left-leaning media outlets now claim the transcript has omissions and is not accurate, Vindman did not make that claim or dispute the accuracy of the transcript. If he later changes course and claims, contrary to his prepared statement, that the transcript is not accurate, then such a shift would raise obvious credibility issues. But that discussion is for another day, if it happens.

I will close with one final observation: Vindman’s public volunteering of his personal opinions contrary to those of his commander-in-chief violates the fundamental rule that military officers should be publicly apolitical, in order to keep the armed forces out of political disputes. I respectfully submit that honoring that fundamental separation is more in line with an officer’s duty than what Vindman did in this case.

The fact that he elected to testify in uniform, thus attempting to add the imprimatur of the U.S. military to boost his credibility, makes it worse.

Donald Trump Versus ‘The Interagency Consensus’,"This week there was an unfortunate blow-up on cable news where Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, one of the witnesses against Donald Trump in the impeachment inquiry, was accused of having loyalty to Ukraine over the United States, since he was born in that country. This argument was unfortunate on two fronts. One, it ironically echoed the absurd and unfair charges that Trump and his supporters — and heck, in the case of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, anyone who doesn’t express complete fealty to Democratic Party elders — must be Putin’s handmaiden.

Two, while antisemitism almost certainly didn’t motivate any of the people who made this argument, the “dual loyalty” canard was unfortunate considering that Vindman and his family were Jewish refugees to the United States escaping Soviet persecution. John Podhoretz wrote a commendable article explaining why this was hurtful to American Jews. So to be clear, I do not call into question Vindman’s service, integrity, or dedication to protecting America.

However, I do think the issue of loyalty to America in a narrow but important sense is at the crux of many of the debates about Donald Trump and his administration. Trump’s presidency has been unfortunately defined by the emergence of senior government officials who are quite open about demonstrating loyalty to the administrative state, up to and including criminal acts and abuses of power, over the imperatives of a democratically elected president.

The people doing these things may even sincerely justify what they’re doing as motivated by patriotism, but that doesn’t mean these abuses aren’t being done at the expense of a vision of America at odds with what the people want. Even if you don’t like Trump, this is a huge threat to the rule of law and the legitimacy of federal governance in the eyes of American citizens.

A Bureaucrat ‘Consensus’ Versus the Elected President

With that in mind, an aspect of Vindman’s testimony against Trump did raise alarm bells. “In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency,” Vindman said in his opening statement. “This narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy. While my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine’s prospects, this alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.”

What are the “consensus views of the interagency” in this context? Trump is accused of withholding aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine investigating the (quite obviously shady) business dealings of a political opponent’s son. However, the aid in question was military aid to the Ukraine, including weapons, to help combat Russia.

Trump’s predecessor, Obama, was unwilling to give the Ukraine lethal military aid. In 2015, Sen. John McCain, not exactly a charter member of the Trump fan club, chastised the Obama administration for this. “The Ukrainians are being slaughtered and we’re sending them blankets and meals. Blankets don’t do well against Russian tanks,” he said.

Were federal officials in 2015 sounding the alarm about Obama defying the “interagency consensus”? Or was the interagency consensus different back then because the president sets policy, not the army of federal employees beneath him?

Now in some respects “interagency consensus” is a benign term of art within the federal government and, again, just because Vindman used the term this way does not mean he’s necessarily part of some fifth-column #resistance undermining Trump. But even as rhetorical matter it is very revealing.

Obstructing the President’s Platform that Voters Cosigned

Part of the reason the phrase jumped out at me when I read Vindman’s testimony was that I had seen it just a few weeks before. When Trump abruptly pulled out of Syria in early October, an article in the Washington Post criticized Trump’s decision for having “been announced swiftly, without warning, and in the absence of interagency consensus.”

If you’ve been following the news the last four years, Trump campaigned on getting out of Syria (and foreign military entanglements generally), got elected, got repeatedly stymied by cabinet officials and the bureaucracy on trying to disengage from Syria, and after obvious and not unwarranted frustration, finally pulled out abruptly, to seemingly everyone in Washington’s chagrin.

Lots and lots of reporting bears out that version of events. Trump may bear the costs of a rash decision, but it also seems true that the decision was rash because the “interagency consensus” would not carry out his wishes to create an orderly exit that best preserves our national security interests, and instead saw their duty as unelected Mandarins to be a counterweight to the president himself.

Although a less interventionist foreign policy is broadly popular, the general feeling in Washington is still aptly summed up by this 2017 Newsweek op-ed, “We Should Permanently Post More U.S. Troops Abroad.” How do we go about this? Well, according to the research professor of national security studies and Gen. Douglas MacArthur chair of research at the Strategic Studies Institute, “the Defense Department should strive for a strong interagency consensus on the importance of increased forward presence…” Even now we still have troops in Syria, so it’s mission accomplished for the interagency consensus, I guess.

New Scandals for a New Era of Big Government

In this respect, a big reason Trump’s presidency is so scandalous is that Washington has a very simplistic and unenlightened idea of what scandals look like. The size and governing structure of the federal government have changed radically in the last half-century, and yet, we’re still attaching the suffix “gate” to every new scandal 45 years after Nixon’s resignation. It’s easy to imagine a conniving White House villain ordering others to commit crimes for political gain. It’s not so easy for anyone to understand even the benign machinations of the “interagency consensus,” much less how it abuses its power and covers it up.

Recall the IRS scandal from the Obama administration. One of the ways the scandal was repeatedly downplayed was with the claim there was no involvement from the White House. As far as we know, that’s true. But tell me, what scenario scares you more: The president allegedly uses his power to instigate the investigation of a political opponent and immediately gets confronted by whistleblowers from within the government?

Or is it when federal employees with the power to ruin your life launch a broad-based attack on thousands of ordinary participants in the political process who not-at-all-coincidentally happen to be small government advocates, and they do this of their own initiative without having to be told what to do by the president because everyone is marching in ideological lockstep? And they further do this secure in the knowledge the president will defend what they’ve done as “not a smidgen of corruption” and that when they destroy tens of thousands of potentially incriminating emails under congressional subpoena there’s not a thing their victims can do about it?

Working for Government Doesn’t Make You Above Elections

Indeed, at every turn opponents of Trump within the government have been defended, often not because what they’ve done is defensible, but because of the false belief that service in the federal government is automatically ennobling and ipso facto makes someone trustworthy. Indeed, the desperate need to defend an administrative state reads at times like fan fiction.

For example, here’s The New York Times: “They Are Not the Resistance. They Are Not a Cabal. They Are Public Servants. Let us now praise these not-silent heroes.” The media have spent more than a year cooing about the anonymous op-ed writer who bragged “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration” even though it’s impossible to determine someone’s credibility without knowing who he is.

You’d think after years of portraying James Comey as the height of moral rectitude only to learn that he and the rest of the senior leadership at the FBI exhibited lots of demonstrably corrupt, even criminal behavior, the media and Trump opposition would disabuse themselves of the notion of the inherently righteous civil servant.

Or the fact that former CIA head John Brennan — a man who lied to Congress about spying on them and played a pivotal role in spreading the defamatory Steele dossier throughout the government to undermine Trump — is openly coordinating efforts to have current government officials undermine the president. And now, the recent revelation of the identity of the whistleblower who set the impeachment inquiry in motion — who was previously fingered for leaks to undermine Trump — raises all manner of questions about his motivations. But the most useful myths are the ones that persist, so precious few questions are being asked of the institutional resistance to Trump.

The Same Standards Should Apply to Everyone

None of this is to say that Vindman and the rest of Trump’s critics are necessarily wrong or Trump is obviously innocent. Even though I have little confidence in the fairness of the process so far, all Americans have a vested interest in the truth and I do hope the real facts come out during the impeachment inquiry. The political chips can then fall where they may.

But it’s also clear that Trump was elected in no small part because tens of millions of Americans do not approve of business as usual in Washington, and specifically the lack of democratic accountability that can be brought to bear on the status quo. And Trump is enough of a natural disruptor that he threatens that status quo in both good and questionable ways. In response, lots of people in D.C. are willing to bend the rules to stop him.

Further, long before Trump arrived there was so much institutional pressure and money sloshing around in the federal government, not mention the trips through the revolving door between already well-compensated federal jobs and even better compensated special interests. Any responsible person ought dispense with the idea that civil servants are always, well, civil. And they ought to apply the same level of appropriate scrutiny and suspicion to federal employees in the news as we do politicians. At least with politicians we have ourselves to blame, but nobody elects an “interagency consensus.”

Bureaucrats’ Hurt Feelings On Foreign Policy Don’t Justify Impeachment,"In recent testimony during his confirmation hearing, the nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Russia said, “Soliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent — I don’t think that would be in accord with our values.”

Never? Let’s do a quick thought experiment. Remember when Donald Trump said he could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and still maintain his support? Suppose a candidate for office did shoot somebody and the only witness was a Russian national who then hopped a plane back to Moscow.

Now suppose that the only way to prosecute this candidate would be for his political rival (the incumbent president) to request cooperation from Russia to extradite this material witness back to the United States to participate in a trial. Should he do it?

Partisanship Is the Deciding Factor

Obviously, in today’s climate, the answer depends on one critical fact: Whose side is the candidate on? If the candidate aligns with the left, then investigating a political opponent would be totally beyond the norms established by our cherished traditions. But if the candidate opposes the left, then the deep state will step in “to protect the country from that menace.”

You see, it’s perfectly fine for Hillary Clinton to use her campaign funds to hire foreign national Christopher Steele to investigate Trump using (probably made-up) Russian sources. And there’s nothing wrong with the FBI using those partisan Steele smears to investigate the Obama administration’s political opponent.

Crossfire Hurricane, the official operational title for the investigation, employed assistance from the British government and an Australian diplomat. So the left believes there’s nothing wrong with asking a foreign government for help to investigate a domestic political opponent — so long as that opponent is Trump. After all, “Nobody is above the law, not even Donald Trump.” But if the shoe ends up on the other foot and Trump is the one investigating, it’s a constitutional crisis!

If you listen for more than a few minutes, you realize what’s really going on here is that Trump failed to prostrate himself before the “dedicated career professionals” who possess the “experience and expertise” that Trump supposedly lacks in foreign policy. Read your Constitution. Article II vests the power of foreign policy in the elected president. These “dedicated career professionals” aren’t even mentioned in the Constitution.

Maybe the framers made a drafting error in the Constitution? Or maybe we shouldn’t have a national impeachment circus over the hurt feelings of bureaucrats.

Unelected Bureaucrats’ Opinion Is Irrelevant

Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another National Security Council staffer, has expressed “alarm” that the president might ask a foreign country for help in a criminal investigation. Who cares what Vindman thinks?

So he was “extremely disturbed” by the phone call with the president of Ukraine? Vindman doesn’t want Trump investigating Biden. If Biden were to shoot somebody on 5th Avenue, it seems Vindman would demand justice and swift punishment for anyone who dared to investigate the shooting. If a tree falls in a forest, it makes no sound if the president can’t investigate.

Who cares what Eric Ciaramella thinks? Paul Sperry recently outed the original Ukraine leaker (“whistleblower”), a hero of the resistance, who (I’m shocked to learn) is “a registered Democrat held over from the Obama White House. Further, he previously worked with former Vice President Joe Biden and former CIA Director John Brennan.”

Wait, the whistleblower is a John Brennan acolyte? Is this the same John Brennan who may be prosecuted for falsely certifying the constitutional compliance of U.S. surveillance? John Brennan who sought to include the discredited Steele dossier in the National Intelligence Assessment? John Brennan who lied to Congress? John Brennan who created a serious constitutional crisis by spying on the Senate to evade oversight?

Clearly, Brennan desperately needs a distraction to prevent Americans from reading the forthcoming inspector general report on FISA abuse. This “scandal” certainly appears made to that order.

Who cares what Marie Yovanovitch thinks? She’s the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who, some believe, used her position to spy on conservative journalists and pundits. Her removal as ambassador was “a political hit job,” which means her politics did not align with the elected president’s politics. Uh, that’s how it works. Elections have consequences, and presidents get to pick their foreign policy team to match their foreign policy goals.

Who cares what the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, thinks? He was “very disappointed by the president’s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani,” adding that the men and women of the State Department “should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.”

Except nobody in the State Department stood for election, and that attitude is likely the exact reason the president wanted somebody he could trust to ensure his foreign policy is actually implemented. Sondland proved these fears true by publicly bashing the president’s approach to foreign policy instead of following the Constitution and deferring to the president’s authority to set that policy.

Who cares what U.S. diplomat William Taylor thinks? His opening statement to the Rep. Adam Schiff-led secret impeachment hearings was selectively leaked to reveal an “irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine,” that operated “mostly outside of official State Department channels.” That probably hurt Taylor’s feelings, but who cares?

Taylor was also shocked that somebody in the Trump administration held up military aid. There are several legitimate diplomatic reasons to hold up the aid. Who cares if Taylor disagrees with the decision? Again, if one of those reasons involved ensuring cooperation with an American DOJ-led investigation into the Biden family, who is Taylor to obstruct that? I thought nobody was above the law — not even a vice president.

Impeachment Isn’t About Protecting the Constitution

On the same day Democrats voted to retroactively endorse the impeachment inquiry, Tim Morrison, a National Security Council official (who listened to the actual phone call), testified, “I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.”

As Sean Davis noted, “Morrison also pointed out key factual inaccuracies in testimony provided by William Taylor, a State Department official who works in the U.S. embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. Morrison said that, contrary to Taylor’s claims, Morrison never met with the Ukrainian National Security adviser in his private hotel room.” Taylor’s challenges with the facts follow the factual inaccuracies of the original whistleblower and the false claims of his sponsor and coach, Schiff.

While the hurt feelings engendering the bureaucratic outrage are real, the supporting facts have tended not to matter as much to the get-Trump conspirators. The entire impeachment exercise is a demonstration that Washington doesn’t want to take orders from the voters. These privileged bureaucrats are so high on their self-righteousness that they actually think they’re protecting the Constitution by obstructing the foreign policy of the elected president.

If they don’t like Pax-Orangeman, they can resign. There’s plenty of money in book deals and CNN contributor fees to piously exhibit their highest loyalties: their egos.

"Desperate Dems Drop ‘Quid Pro Quo’ Rhetoric, Now It’s ‘Extortion’ And ‘Bribery’","As the hours of transcripts of witnesses in the Ukraine impeachment inquiry rack up and continue to underwhelm, Democrats and their allies in the media have seized on a new tactic. The old, archaic term “quid pro quo,” is about to go the way of the Dodo. In its place the terms “extortion” and “bribery” will fly about like hot air balloons in California wine country.

Here we see the new terms in action from Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., yesterday on CNN. The supposed justification for this ramping up of the rhetoric is an amendment that Ambassador Gordon Sondland made to his testimony before the impeachment inquiry in which he said that on September 1st, 10 days before aid to Ukraine was released, he told a Ukrainian official that that aid was not likely to flow if a promise was not made to investigate the gas company Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden. Such a promise was never delivered.

“We keep using the word quid pro quo, but the accurate word here is bribery and extortion. Those are criminal charges.” @RepGaramendi reacts to Gordon Sondland’s revised impeachment inquiry testimony. https://t.co/7p8voPC14h pic.twitter.com/TbLK3guJGl — CNN (@CNN) November 5, 2019

Though Sondland’s revision of his testimony is being heralded as a bombshell (what isn’t) by Democrats, the revelation doesn’t change the basic facts of the case. The so-called scandal still boils down to the President wanting an anti-corruption review of Ukraine before releasing the aid, which included a desire to have Burisma investigated. Rankling in the diplomatic corps ensued about the appropriateness of this condition, and the aid eventually flowed without it having been met.

In terms of describing what actually happened, there is little difference between alleging a “quid pro quo,” “extortion,” or “bribery.” Everything still depends upon whether president Trump was acting within his power by delaying the aid while also asking Ukraine to fight corruption, including that which might involve Vice President Biden’s son. The real reason that our national lesson in Latin is about to give way is that Democrats hope that “extortion,” and “bribery” sounds worse to Americans.

The effort to use nastier sounding words to describe the alleged high crime or misdemeanor they can’t quite describe is understandable from Democrats who see impeachment losing steam with the public. In a Morning Consult poll today, support for impeachment dropped 4 points down to 47 percent with 43 percent disapproving. Not only does this reversal point to a possible conviction in the Senate being a pipe dream, it also endangers moderate Democratic legislators at a time when even Nancy Pelosi says the party has lurched too far left.

Democrats are wrong to think that spicy language is going to change the basic dynamic of the impeachment fight, which has been and remains that voters who dislike Trump want him impeached and those who like or even tolerate him don’t. To move that needle Democrats need a simple, straightforward story to tell of exactly what crime or misdemeanor Trump committed and how they can prove it. The bottom line question is still whether Trump acted within his authority and whether the process by which the aid was eventually released broke the law.

But the rhetorical shift does tell us a story about how many Democrats feel the impeachment effort is going. And it’s not a happy one. I recently described this lightning fast impeachment effort as a Blitzkrieg, which is a military tactic in which an army strikes very hard, very fast, in the hopes of a victory in very short order. The downside of this tactic is that if you slow down, if you start to run out of steam, you become badly exposed. Supply lines become distant and reinforcements hard to rally.

This is where the Democrats find themselves. In promising to finish impeachment this year they have all but assured that the basic facts of the case for impeachment will not change very much. It is very unlikely that in a short time frame any new evidence will move independent or Republican voters’ opinions much.

Democrats are essentially going to have the play the hand they have right now, whatever terms they use to describe the cards. That hand is clearly not as strong as they would like it to be in terms of convincing Americans the result of the 2016 election should be overturned. The newly painted patina of legitimacy they hoped the slap dash public process voted on last week will provide is instead locking them into a case that has already failed to amass any bipartisan support.

The facts of the case are the facts of the case no matter how anybody wrangles verbiage. The basic facts of the case have not changed, and neither has the opinion of the American people.

Requiring The Bidens To Testify Would Show If America Was For Sale,"If impeaching President Donald Trump is truly about arriving at the truth, then the Democrats who have obsequiously lectured about this for the past several weeks should have no problem including Joe and Hunter Biden in the impeachment proceedings. Forcing the Bidens to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee would provide an opportunity for Americans to learn to what extent, if at all, former Vice President Joe Biden used his position to financially benefit several of his family members, most notably his son Hunter.

Less than a month ago, there were murmurs that the Senate Judiciary Committee, under the auspices of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was considering having the Bidens testify before the committee on their actions in Ukraine. Graham received some pushback for considering this move, Sen. Chuck Grassley declaring that he would support such a endeavor only if there were a certain level of precision in the line of questioning. “I’d want to know what he wants to accomplish by bringing [Joe Biden] before the committee,” Grassley stated, when asked about Graham’s potential plans.

Others, such as Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, expressed skepticism at the thought of having Joe Biden testify before the committee. “It wouldn’t be my highest priority. We need limited bandwidth if we need to try to focus on getting things done, not contributing to the sideshow,” Cornyn stated back in October.

Now, GOP senators are once again considering including the Bidens in Trump’s impeachment trial. There’s a legitimate (and arguably, well-founded) fear that involving the Bidens in the impeachment process is a “risky political ploy.” However, it’s more damaging to our democratic republic to have a class of politicians immunized from investigation because they happen to be running for president.

At one point, the Democratic field had 30 contenders. Did each of these individuals become vaccinated against possible accusations of corruption because they were in the running to become Donald Trump’s chief contender? Phrased differently, is there enough hatred of Trump swirling around Washington that we are not interested in determining whether the individual who held the second-highest office in the land for eight years allows his son to sell access to foreign governments?

Despite the media’s attempts to portray the accusations against Hunter Biden as mere “nothing burgers,” Hunter Biden unequivocally established relationships with foreign actors interested in shaping U.S. policy at critical junctures in his father’s career. The question at the base of these accusations is how aware then-Vice President Joe Biden was of such arrangements and whether the line between crony capitalism and sheer corruption was ever crossed. Although neither is particularly desirable, one is legal, while the other is not.

Hunter received a position on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company of Burisma with a salary of $50,000 per month, despite having no experience in the energy sector and at a time his father was the point-man on the United States’ Ukraine policy. His father eventually pushed to have the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired under the banner of waging an “anti-corruption” campaign in the country.

On a 2013 diplomatic trip to China, then-Vice President Joe Biden permitted his son Hunter to join him on Air Force Two. At the time, Hunter had recently teamed up with Chinese businessman Johnathan Li to start a Chinese-backed private equity firm, and during the Bidens’ time in China, Hunter eventually introduced Li to his father. It’s worth noting that prior to the trip, Hunter had been awaiting approval for a business license from the Chinese government. Within two weeks of the trip’s end, he had received it.

The strangeness does not end there. Less than two weeks ago, it was revealed that Joe Biden, while a prominent U.S. senator, had consulted various government agencies to advocate for specific agenda items that his son’s lobbying firm then happened to be pushing—a coincidence that miraculously occurred several times. Individually, each incident might seem benign or excusable; however, taken together, they paint a far more complex and alarming picture.

Based on recent testimonies, the question at the center of the impeachment inquiry is now whether, when President Trump withheld aid on the basis of encouraging Ukraine to fight corruption, he did so under the auspices of the correct authority. Answering this question will likely require ascertaining the legitimacy of the corruption accusations against the Bidens.

I penned the following reflection back in September, and it largely still holds true, whether you believe a quid pro quo took place or not.

…Much of the discussion of the whistleblower complaint has centered on amplifying and condemning Trump’s behavior without much mention of what Joe Biden’s son was doing in Ukraine. There’s a pervasive attitude among those in the media and on the left that if Trump improperly requested an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter, the impropriety of the request somehow makes the potential behavior of Hunter Biden and his father acceptable. This reaction is incoherent and bizarre.

It’s unfortunate that because President Trump is asking the questions, the behavior of those he seeks to investigate suddenly becomes palatable or eligible to be shoved under the rug. There are some disturbing coincidences that deserved to be investigated, whether it is Trump seeking to investigate them or not.

If it has to be under the banner of Trump impeachment, so be it. I, for one, would like to know if our executive branch was for sale from 2008 to 2016, and although Trump may present his own concerns, him asking the question doesn’t undermine the American public’s need to know the answer.

Yovanovitch Emailed With Dem Staffer After Whistleblower Complaint,"New email evidence has surfaced indicating that a Democratic staffer from the House Foreign Affairs Committee had contact with former President Obama’s Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, contrary to information she provided in her “impeachment inquiry” deposition, according to exclusive information obtained by Tucker Carlson of Fox News.

Yovanovitch has sat at the center of the House Democrats’ “impeachment probe,” earning her Resistance stripes after she was recalled from her post by President Trump in May 2019, following accusations of “serious partisanship” and “political bias.”

According to an exclusive email obtained by Carlson, the Democratic staffer, now identified by Fox News as Laura Carey, wrote the following to Yovanovitch on August 14, 2019, two days after the whistleblower complaint was filed, but an entire month before the complaint went public. It was sent from Carey’s official House email to Yovanovitch’s personal account:

I’m writing to see if you would have time to meet up for a chat – in particular, I’m hoping to discuss some Ukraine-related oversight questions we are exploring. I’d appreciate the chance to ground-truth a few pieces of information with you, some of which are quite delicate/time-sensitive and, thus, we want to make sure we get them right.

The timeline of this email is critical. It is known that the whistleblower contacted Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Cal.) before filing his complaint. As Carlson points out, given that the above email was sent before the whistleblower complaint went public, it’s worth asking Schiff whether he had the audacity to contact other Democrat teams on the Hill about the complaint and its contents before it became public knowledge. In other words, what kind of stealthy (and possibly corrupt) machinations were taking place behind the scenes before the whistleblower’s complaint was used as a public pretext for launching an impeachment inquiry?

When Carlson questioned the spokesman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tim Mulvey, the response expectedly nodded towards Yovanovitch’s recall, which at the time of the email, had occurred three months prior: “The Committee wanted to hear from an ambassador whose assignment was cut short under unusual circumstances…This staff outreach was part of a months-long effort that culminated in the September 9 launch of an investigation into these events.”

What makes the email particularly unsettling is that it indicates Yovanovitch possibly committed perjury during her “impeachment inquiry” deposition, where she was questioned under oath. During her closed-door questioning on October 11, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) asked Yovanovitch directly about the nature of her contacts with the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Yovanovitch stated that she personally had not responded to the first email sent to her by an individual from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and that she had ignored the second overture.

The initial email came “from the Foreign Affairs Committee,” and “they wanted me to come in and talk about, I guess, the circumstances of my departure” which included her recall at the hands of President Trump in May 2019. Yovanovitch asserted that she “alerted the State Department” since she was “still an employee, and so, matters are generally handled through the State Department.”

Yovaovitch alleged that she “believe[d]” someone in Legislative Affairs had responded to the initial email. She also admits to receiving a second email but claims she did not respond to that email.

Her answers, however, do not square with Carlson’s reporting, which reveals Yovanovitch did respond to the House Foreign Affairs staffer just a day after the August 14 email, admitting she “would love to reconnect and looked forward to chatting” with the staffer. Furthermore, the initial email mentioned a “delicate matter,” not specifically her recall under President Trump.

Four days after Yovanovitch’s response, Carey responded by saying that “it would be ideal to connect this week…assuming this week is doable for you schedule-wise?” It is clear that Carey’s email conveyed urgency.

Thus, as Zeldin wrote on Twitter, there is a strong likelihood that Yovanotich thus committed perjury. The relevant portion of the transcript, tweeted by Zeldin, is included below:

It appears Ambassador Yovanovitch did not accurately answer this question I asked her during her “impeachment inquiry” deposition under oath. https://t.co/2Ju420Pkpb pic.twitter.com/WACsyksMzW — Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) November 8, 2019

Zeldin reiterated to Fox News, “I specifically asked [Yovanovitch] whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department. It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch didn’t answer my question as honestly as she should have, especially while under oath.”

The latest revelations further buttress accusations that the House’s “impeachment inquiry” has been a dishonest endeavor, “cooked up” by Democrats through possibly months of backdoor dealings. According to reporting at Fox News, “it is a breach of normal procedure for congressional staff to reach out to a current State Department employee at their personal email address for official business.”

What did Carey hope to discuss with Yovanovitch? If it was related to the whistleblower’s complaint, how much had Schiff been sharing with others on the Hill before going public with the complaint?

When House Democrats allege their “impeachment inquiry” has been a transparent and fair endeavor, incidents like these indicate it has been anything but. House Democrats should be forced to answer these uncomfortable questions, if only to avoid the “fruit of the poisonous tree” that accompanies an invalid process.

In other words, if dishonest episodes continue to wreak havoc on this inquiry, any impeachment (and possible removal) that results from it likely will be seen as tainted and illegitimate. Democrats should take heed.

Schiff’s Committee Published Name Of Alleged Whistleblower Last Week,"Last Wednesday, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), chaired by Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, published the unredacted name of a man alleged to be the so-called whistleblower who helped launch impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

During HPSCI testimony, William Taylor, the charge d’affairs of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, was asked by a staff lawyer on the committee whether the name Eric Ciaramella was familiar to him.

“Does a person by the name of Eric Ciaramella ring a bell for you?” asked Steve Castor, a committee staff counsel asked Taylor during a deposition on October 22.

“It doesn’t,” Taylor responded.

“So, to your knowledge, you never had any communications with somebody by that name?”

“Correct,” Taylor said.

The transcript of that exchange, which was not redacted, was published and publicly released by Schiff’s committee last Wednesday.

On October 30, Real Clear Investigations published a lengthy article alleging that Ciaramella was the official who filed a formal complaint against Trump on August 12.

“Ciaramella (pronounced char-a-MEL-ah) left his National Security Council posting in the White House’s West Wing in mid-2017 amid concerns about negative leaks to the media,” Real Clear Investigations reported in October. “He has since returned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.”

In September, The New York Times all but outed the alleged whistleblower, identifying him as a CIA employee and Ukraine expert who had been detailed to the White House by former Obama CIA director John Brennan.

When news of the whistleblower’s complaint first broke, Schiff demanded repeatedly that the anti-Trump bureaucrat should come forward and testify to his committee.

“We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted at the time.

We have been informed by the whistleblower’s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so. We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019

Schiff and two other Democratic committee chairmen even issued a joint press release explaining why the anti-Trump complainant needed to testify to Congress.

“We need to speak with the whistleblower,” the top Democratic lawmakers wrote.

But when it was revealed that Schiff and his staff had secretly coordinated with the whistleblower and urged him to file a formal complaint against Trump, Schiff and his media allies immediately changed course, declaring it would be dangerous and unprecedented for the complainant to testify publicly. Schiff then flip-flopped and insisted that the anti-Trump complainant be hidden from scrutiny.

Prior to the revelation that Schiff and his staff had secretly worked with the anti-Trump complainant before he even filed a complaint against Trump, Schiff repeatedly denied any contact with the complainant. To date, he has not explained why he lied about his secret interactions with the complainant, nor has he detailed the full extent of his coordination with him.

Congressional Republicans have vowed to call the complainant as a witness in impeachment proceedings, but it is unclear whether he will be required to testify, as House Democrats passed rules requiring Schiff to approve all subpoenas and even questions asked of witnesses.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/10/schiffs-committee-published-name-of-alleged-whistleblower-last-week/,2019-11-10
The Media Holds Massive Double Standard About Naming Whistleblowers,"Does the public have a right to know the name of the man who commenced the current effort to impeach the president of the United States? The Trump-hating media, following the lead of Trump-hating House Democrats, seems to think not. It seems they believe he should be held to a different standard than other whistleblowers.

Indeed, many legacy media refuse to run the presumed name of the so-called Ukraine whistleblower in spite of ample evidence as to his identity. Likewise, Twitter is trying to deter users from divulging his name by punishing select accounts that have done so. YouTube has similarly banned mentions of his name across their entire site.

Such entities appear to have fallen in line with Rep. Adam Schiff, leader of the illegitimate impeachment inquiry. Schiff was prepared to give the complainant a public hearing before doing an abrupt about-face after it was revealed the congressman and his staff had coordinated with the whistleblower prior to the complaint being filed, and then lied about it.

Revelations about the ties of both the presumed whistleblower, as well as one of his lawyers, to Russiagate and the broader apparent rolling coup against the president only further undermine the credibility of the impeachment process and its underlying substance. Consequently, it is unclear whether the whistleblower will even respond to written questions from House members.

Dems Have No Good Reason to Hide the Whistleblower

Before addressing the media’s newfound fidelity to protecting whistleblowers and other newsworthy subjects, it is critical to note it is not Republicans but Democrats who brought this complainant into the political realm and therefore made his identity germane. They did so by dint of making the whistleblower’s complaint the basis of their impeachment “inquiry.”

Impeachment, of course, is a political remedy. (The intelligence community inspector general, or ICIG, is also culpable to the extent that he modified whistleblower forms and policies seemingly specifically to make the complaint in question admissible.) Democrats cannot credibly argue they have a legal, let alone political, duty to keep the whistleblower anonymous in an impeachment context. On the contrary, given the gravity of the political matter, they have a duty to be fully transparent about every aspect of their so-called inquiry.

As for the media, can we attribute its devotion to respecting the privacy of parties involved in sensitive matters to anything other than politics? The evidence suggests not.

The Media Has a Double Standard for Whistleblowers

First, contrary to the claims of some talking heads, there is nothing illegal about the media running this person’s name. It is only the ICIG who is barred from outing the whistleblower, pursuant to U.S.C. § 3033(g)(3)(A). Even the whistleblower’s lawyers acknowledge this by omission in a statement on protecting his identity.

Second, consider the contrast in media treatment of purported whistleblower Eric Ciaramella and that of Adam Lovinger, in context of the supposed desire to protect whistleblowers from reprisal, governmental or otherwise.

Based on the RealClearInvestigations report on Ciaramella, given his laundry list of anti-Trump bona fides and apparent connections to leaders in the national security and foreign policy apparatus, he would appear to be a proverbial “made man” of the deep state. It is hard to fathom at this point any circumstance in which he could be the subject of reprisal, which should allay any media fears.

Meanwhile, should he leave public office, he will resign as a Resistance hero. You will probably find him on CNN. And if his security were of primary concern, then Schiff would have never originally been so gung-ho about having the whistleblower appear publicly in the first place. It strains credulity to believe a member of the CIA who had colluded with Schiff would not know the stakes of the game he entered.

Conversely, Lovinger, a man with impeccable credentials as a longtime member of the national security apparatus and supporter of the Trump administration’s agenda, saw his career destroyed after whistleblowing on activity he saw as fraudulent. Lovinger called into question the legitimacy of lucrative but possibly sham contracts doled out by the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment to, among others, Stefan Halper, the confidential informant who spied on the Trump campaign, as well as a close confidante of Chelsea Clinton on whose behalf Hillary Clinton had lobbied.

In what appears to be an egregious example of administrative state tyranny, Lovinger was pushed out of his new position in the Trump National Security Council (NSC), stripped of his security clearance, and finally suspended without pay while trying to litigate four apparently meritless cases against officials he alleges targeted him for his whistleblowing.

His lawyer’s account of the apparent farce of a process, in violation of due process rights, in which the agency that targeted him played judge, jury, and executioner, must be read in full to be believed. To give just one example of the war waged against Lovinger, in August 2019 it was revealed the government had completed a secret and ultimately exculpatory investigation into one of the charges against him, without ever notifying his defense team of the exoneration in advance of his administrative trial. The apparent persecution of Lovinger was so egregious that back in October 2018, Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, introduced the Adam S. Lovinger Whistleblower Reprisal Act.

The Media Is Playing Political Games

As for the media’s role, according to Lovinger’s counsel, government officials leaked false and defamatory information that the media dutifully printed, apparently not believing Lovinger deserved whistleblower protection like Ciaramella.

The media went still further. Rather than highlight Lovinger’s case as an example of the abuse to which genuine government whistleblowers are often subjected, it sought to mock the alleged victim and undermine his defense by casting it as politicized. In a December 2018 article titled “Blaming the Deep State: Officials Accused of Wrongdoing Adopt Trump’s Response” — back in the days when The New York Times was still rolling its eyes at the notion of a deep state, rather than wholeheartedly embracing it — the Times portrayed Lovinger as pioneering “the deep state defense,” “fashion[ing] himself a victim of Democratic-supporting national security officials.” It sought to sully his claims of whistleblower reprisal as based on an illegitimate conspiracy theory argument.

Lastly, consider not only the media’s apparent double standard in treatment of whistleblowers, but its hypocrisy on the matter. This was brought into stark relief when on ABC’s “The View,” Donald Trump Jr. noted that while ABC was doggedly defending the Ukraine whistleblower’s identity, it was pursuing a whistleblower concerning its efforts to kill reporting on Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal conduct. That whistleblower was identified as a staffer at competitor CBS, which promptly fired her.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1192479939767001088

The media has had no qualms about chasing stories targeting government officials (who would have otherwise remained nameless and faceless) pursuing sensitive matters. In recent weeks, for example, a series of pieces have dragged staffers such as Derek Harvey and Kash Patel through the mud, people who served both in the Trump administration and under Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Why no concern for their safety?

Nor has the media ever apologized for the deluge of leaks — many of which have proved false and seemed aimed at drowning the Trump administration — that have harmed countless other people swept up in the reporting through no fault of their own. For that matter, why has the media never apologized for outing a minor who was the subject of a massive social media mob, Covington Catholic High School’s Nicholas Sandmann?

The answer, it appears, is politics.

Ukrainegate Is a Russiagate Repeat

As with Schiff’s entire impeachment process, by refusing to admit the name of the whistleblower, the media seems to want to be able to control the narrative rather than subject him to the scrutiny that, based on current knowledge of his background, is more than deserved.

That is, they wish to control a narrative that suggests President Trump sought to engage in untoward behavior with Ukraine that potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden actually engaged in – just as Trump was accused of colluding with Russians while 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton actually did so.

With Russiagate, they claim Trump desired to commit a crime, which they cannot cite, by conducting foreign policy as he saw fit, just as they claimed he desired to obstruct justice, without an underlying crime, by making personnel decisions as he saw fit. What we are witnessing in the attempt to hide the whistleblower is just the Ukrainegate version of the deep state’s game-playing with redactions, undertaken by its media colluders.

One must ask: If the media admitted to being the Democratic Party’s communications arm, would it act any differently? Again, the whistleblower’s name became relevant when this became a political rather than a legal process.

The American people deserve to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about the motives of every person involved in this impeachment process — particularly when it stems from someone’s opinion of what Trump believed in his own mind, reflected in a complaint based on hearsay, from a Biden-tied Russiagate player who was reportedly thrown out of the Trump NSC for suspected leaking, regarding a single phone call alleging a quid pro quo that never materialized and that would have never qualified as a high crime and misdemeanor had it ever been executed.

"Alex Vindman Is Living Proof That The Deep State Exists, And Is Corrupt","Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is living, breathing, testifying proof the Deep State exists. He has shown his true colors and the agenda of the self-appointed elites who think they run this country.

Let me state categorically that I am not implying dual loyalty or questioning Vindman’s patriotism or even his devotion to duty as he sees it. I’m questioning his judgment about where that duty lies and the execution of those duties as a military officer and civil servant.

The term “deep state” is now highly charged politically. The right takes it as a given, the left sometimes denies its existence. Here’s my definition for the purposes of this discussion.

Deep State (noun): The permanent, professional bureaucracy of the U.S. government, specifically those who believe their judgment and continual service makes them better suited to run the country than elected officials or political appointees.

That’s accurate, but to expand on why it matters, we should note the political contributions of federal employees in the last presidential election went 95 percent to Hillary Clinton. There is nothing illegal or nefarious about that, but it certainly points out the one-sided political nature of this cohort. While they may not openly organize into political action committees, their hold on federal levers of power dangerously skews government’s actions and inactions toward the preferences of the political left.

Any mention of this is immediately discounted and attacked by the media because they have a symbiotic relationship with these folks. They are the sources for most of the leaks that are the lifeblood of the political press, and exposing that is in neither group’s interest. They treat it as a conspiracy theory and continue to use it to serve their joint purpose of advancing a leftist agenda globally. They do this regardless of which party has political control of government, although their cooperation with Democrats and undermining of Republicans is the deepest problem.

The DC Game Is Rigged to Favor the Deep State

The game is fixed in DC: politicians come and go, but the bureaucracy chugs along protecting and advancing its own interests. Two perfect examples unfolded in the most recent presidencies. Barack Obama chose a nuclear deal with Iran as the legacy achievement of his foreign policy. He pursued it relentlessly to our detriment, both in actual ability to stop Iran from getting nukes, and in subjugating our entire foreign policy to this one goal.

The Deep State loved it. They were all in on his side, and the media had never more completely acted as palace scribes dutifully parroting every administration talking point and obfuscating or attacking contrary views. They faithfully misinformed the public to the best of their ability, and in the end Obama, the bureaucrats, and the media rammed the deal through while the American public showed 2-1 disapproval. It was a victory for the Deep State.

Shift forward to the 2016 election campaign and the collusion between Democrats and Deep Staters to stop the Trump train and then, after it left Inauguration Station, to derail it. The Trump-Russia witch hunt is an egregious example of the power of the state being abused for partisan political purposes.

That failed to deliver the goal of deposing the president, and may even backfire as the investigations into it complete and there is a possibility of indictments for some of the conspirators. Having come at the president and missed, they decided to redouble their efforts, so we come to the impeachment inquiry currently operating in full kangaroo court fashion.

Vindman’s Testimony Gives the Game Away

They began with a “whistleblower,” but it was quickly shown that this person was nowhere near any of the events in question and likely colluded with Democrats prior to even filing the complaint. They needed a better front man, and Vindman was perfect: a military officer with a Purple Heart and privy to all the requisite details as the Ukraine desk lead for the National Security Council. Who would dare impugn his honor?

But Vindman gave the game away with his prepared testimony. He believes the permanent bureaucracy should reign supreme, and if some elected politician gets crosswise with the solons of the state, then they must act. So he did, as he detailed in his prepared statement and testimony to Congress. From the statement: “In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency. This narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy.”

There is a lot of wrong in those two sentences, which profoundly illustrate the fundamental flaw Vindman and his fellow Deep Staters operate under. The interagency he mentions is a collection of staff from the major agencies like the State Department, Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies, who meet to coordinate and plan implementation of policy. They most certainly are not supposed to decide what policy the United States will follow. That is 100 percent the purview of the president.

Dissenters Within Government Will Be Persecuted

As for “outside influencers,” Vindman is primarily speaking of Rudy Giuliani, who was acting in some ways as a private citizen, but also as an emissary of President Trump. During his testimony, Vindman was asked who else he meant as “outside,” and he named U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sonland and U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker.

This is telling, as Giuliani may somewhat fairly be called an outsider, even though he was acting at the president’s behest, but both Sonland and Volker are members of the government with direct responsibility for Ukraine and are significantly senior to Vindman. Yet Vindman called them “outsiders,” saying Volker as special representative for Ukraine was fine when he “was working in concert with the interagency,” but when in contact with Giuliani “that was not the case”; and that Sonland was “a bit of an outside influencer.”

His standard for an outsider was anyone not in concert with the unelected mid-level bureaucrats of the interagency. Wrong answer, but indicative of his belief that they are the ones whose opinions matter and anyone acting outside of that is acting against U.S. interests. Even if that conflicted with the policy of his superiors all the way up to the president, Vindman and the Deep State would decide what “advanced U.S. policy interests.”

Vindman also took action warning Ukrainian officials he spoke to: “I would tell them to not interfere — not get involved in U.S. domestic politics.”

This was after Vindman says he had determined the calls for an investigation into election interference and anything related to Burisma corruption and the Bidens equaled President Trump trying to get Ukraine to interfere in U.S. politics. He was actively undermining what he believes is the president’s chosen policy—not because it is illegal, but because he disagrees with it and doesn’t think it is important.

That is far beyond Vindman’s duties or authority, and in applying his opinion and actions to counter the president’s goals, Vindman may be violating Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which covers insubordination to the president and other named officials.

This is insubordination and malfeasance, and likely punishable under several sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

Using Bureaucracy As a Weapon of Politics

I disagree with Vindman that Trump was using these investigations for purely political purposes. There were legitimate U.S. concerns about election interference and corruption related to senior U.S. officials.

Vindman argued in testimony that he didn’t believe these allegations were credible, but it’s not his position to decide that. It’s his job to give his advice saying he doesn’t agree they are credible but then execute the president’s foreign policy decisions once they are made. Instead, he sabotaged them.

Vindman had previously shown he did not know his place in the hierarchy of our government. During a trip to celebrate the inauguration of the new president of Ukraine, Volodomyr Zelensky, he actually lectured the new president on staying out of U.S. domestic politics.

This was another glaring example of Vindman attempting to undermine President Trump’s efforts to get investigations moving. It would be hard to explain how stunningly inappropriate it was for someone this junior to address a world leader in this fashion, especially in front of senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

Now Vindman serves the interests of the partisan witch hunt round two happening in the House. The first one failed, as former special counsel Robert Mueller found zero collusion. Now the Dems and the Deep State have elevated more policy disagreements to what amounts to an attempted coup.

It’s doubtful they’ll succeed in actually removing the president, because even if the shenanigans in the House result in a vote to impeach the president, there is near zero chance the Senate will convict. They will be able to call all the witnesses and ask all the questions that ringmaster Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has forbidden in the House. This may even show that Vindman was one of the sources the whistleblower used in making the complaint that started this whole charade.

The whole impeachment inquiry may backfire hugely when the American people see and hear the full extent of what the unelected, self-selected Deep State has tried to do to a duly elected U.S. president. Let’s hope so.

It should certainly serve as a warning of the danger posed when the permanent bureaucracy chooses a side. Our government must be responsible to the desires of the people as indicated by the leaders elected to serve them, not the partisan goals of the Deep State.

"In Their Own Words, Democrats Explain Why This Impeachment Is A Farce","It’s getting exhausting having to explain over and over and over why the Ukraine farce is a silly (if sinister) exhibition of poorly written political fiction. As such, I’m going to hand the microphone over to some of the people advancing this terrible sequel to the horrible Russia collusion hoax. Let’s start with the former vice president, the person with whom this all started. What is his opinion about the scandal?

“This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,” Biden said in a statement. “It means that [President Trump] used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.”

Whoa! Don’t be so rough on yourself, Joe. Here is Biden’s video-recorded confession that he “used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.”

He said, “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. (Laughter) He got fired.” Biden held up U.S. aid to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired — but Donald Trump needs to be impeached.

Witnesses Are Only Relevant If They Favor Impeachment

How about the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee? Rep. Adam Schiff recently penned an article in which he partially explained why he’s so triggered. He wants to know whether the White House conditioned a meeting with Ukraine, “on Ukraine’s willingness to launch and publicly announce sham political investigations to discredit the unanimous conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and into President Trump’s potential political rival in 2020.”

Somewhere in Schiff’s version of the Constitution, it says the elected U.S. president can’t question or attempt to discredit a “unanimous” conclusion or else he must be impeached.

Schiff recently issued this letter in which he explained the criteria for approving witnesses requested by Republicans in his hippity-hoppity kangaroo impeachment court. Such witnesses must be “relevant,” or Schiff will not approve them. In order for a witness to be relevant, he or she must not contradict any of the following assumptions:

That the president requested a foreign leader and government to initiate an investigation to benefit the president’s personal political interests, That the president sought to use the power of his office to advance his political interests, and That the president sought to obstruct, suppress, or cover up evidence of his actions.

Thus, in black and white, Schiff wrote a letter that instructed the powerless Republican minority that only evidence of the president’s guilt would be considered relevant. Does Schiff have a barn? “Maybe we could hold the trial there. I’ll sew the costumes and maybe Uncle Goober can be the judge.”

Anything that discredits the unanimous conclusion that Trump committed a high crime or misdemeanor will not be received as relevant evidence. So under this criteria, would evidence of a legitimate law enforcement concern over Biden’s involvement in Ukraine be relevant to justify Trump’s interest? No. Only evidence of Trump’s guilt is “relevant.”

What about evidence of the highly partisan nature of the whistleblower and his contacts with the chairman? No. There’s a unanimous conclusion that the burden of proof is on the president to prove the absence of his political motives.

Democrats Are Undermining Democracy

The House impeachment effort is a brazen attempt to protect the “independence” of the permanent bureaucracy. It’s bureaucracy versus democracy, and the ironically named Democratic Party has gone to the mattresses to oppose the threat that elections pose to permanent bureaucratic power.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told America, “It’s an abuse of power [for the elected president] to remove an [unelected] ambassador for political reasons because you don’t like what they’re doing … period.” Others have suggested the president should be impeached for threatening the independence of the Department of Justice. Others have argued that Trump questioning the House Intelligence Committee is an act of treason.

The voters are supposed to exercise their control over these powerful bureaucratic functions through their elected president. If Schiff gets his way, however, our elections will become ceremonial exercises that never change real power.

That leads to the question: Why take this question away from the voters? The voters can simply vote for a new president next year. For this, we turn to Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who was asked, “Congressman, are you concerned that impeachment talk might actually help the president’s reelection?” Green answered, “I’m concerned that if we don’t impeach this president, he will get reelected.”

So in the words of the people running impeachment: Joe Biden threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine unless it fired the prosecutor investigating his son’s company. This is a crime so troubling that nothing short of impeaching Trump will address the gravity of the situation.

Republicans will be allowed to call any witness and ask any question so long as the information shows why the president is guilty. All of this will defend bureaucratic independence, which has been threatened by the results of the 2016 election and must be accomplished before the voters have a chance to repeat their mistake in 2020.

These are their words. That’s what they’re saying about their own farce.

Democrats' Star Witness Admitted Burisma Should Be Investigated,"Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent made the case for launching an investigation into the Bidens and their involvement in Ukraine related to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine, said during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in the Democrats’ partisan impeachment proceedings Wednesday he was concerned about a, “perception of a conflict of interest,” related to Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, serving on the board of the energy company while his father oversaw the Obama administration’s policy towards Ukraine.

Hunter Biden served on the board of the company for $50,000 a month despite having no prior experience in the energy industry while his father served as vice president deeply involved U.S.-Ukrainian policy.

Kent also testified in a private deposition that he voiced his discomfort over the situation to the White House in 2015 where administration officials brushed off Kent’s concerns.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told lawmakers behind closed doors in October. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth the deal with family related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

During his testimony before the House on Wednesday, Kent reiterated his conviction that officials in Ukraine ought to be investigated to root out corruption related to Burisma.

“To summarize, we thought the [CEO of Burisma] had stolen money. We thought a prosecutor had take an bribe to shut the case,” Kent said.

“Are you in favor of that matter being fully investigated and prosecuted?” asked Minority House Intelligence Committee Counsel Steve Castor.

“I think, since U.S. taxpayer dollars were wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe, and how much of it was paid,” Kent said.

In an interview with ABC News last month, Hunter admitted to practicing “poor judgement,” by serving on the board as his father’s presidential campaign has struggled amid new details of the scandal coming to light from Trump’s impeachment proceedings.

House Democrats opened formal partisan impeachment proceedings against the president following reports of a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Media outlets reported details of the call, alleging Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid.

An unredacted transcript of the phone call has since been declassified, revealing no such quid pro quo as Democrats had charged and continue to claim. Despite the release of the transcript, Democrats have aggressively pushed forward with impeachment as their best hopes to undo the 2016 election after the Russian collusion hoax failed to incriminate the president earlier this year.

Since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the anti-Trump investigation in September, the proceedings were held in secret where House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California ran partisan proceedings prohibiting Republican members from asking questions Schiff did not want witnesses to answer, pre-interviewing witnesses in preparation for public testimony.

Even after Pelosi put a formal impeachment inquiry to a vote a month and a half after proceedings had already begun, Schiff continued to run hearings behind closed doors for two weeks before holding the first public hearing Wednesday.

This Impeachment Inquiry Is Really About Who Sets U.S. Foreign Policy,"Despite the hysterical headlines in the mainstream media, there was no bombshell on the first day of public testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. It was actually very boring and tedious.

But for those who had the patience to sit through it on Wednesday, the testimony of veteran State Department officials William Taylor and George Kent did help clarify what this impeachment inquiry is all about: a disagreement between President Trump and a coterie of career State Department bureaucrats about what U.S. policy should be in Ukraine.

To put it more bluntly, the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is about whether the president or unelected officials in the State Department should be able to determine U.S. foreign policy and define U.S. national interests abroad.

What we heard Wednesday was a lot of opinions from Taylor and Kent about what U.S. policy should be in Ukraine and what serves the national interest there. But if President Trump has a different view, whose opinion should matter? Clearly, the president’s opinion is the one that counts because the president, not State Department officials, sets U.S. foreign policy.

But in Democrats’ telling, which has been dutifully parroted by the media, the impeachment inquiry is all about whether Trump made U.S. security aid to Ukraine dependent on an investigation of Burisma and the Bidens—a quid pro quo, an investigation of Trump’s political rival in exchange for hundreds of millions in U.S. aid. To maintain this narrative, Democrats have had to insist there could be no other motive for Trump to want to such an investigation.

That’s why Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman kept referring to “political investigations” during Wednesday’s hearing. Trump wanted dirt on Joe Biden because he thought it would help him win reelection in 2020, end of story.

But of course there are perfectly valid reasons to think that corruption investigations in Ukraine might serve other, broader interests that go beyond just Trump’s reelection. Kent himself testified that such investigations were in fact legitimate, given the history of endemic corruption in Ukraine and specifically a record of corruption at Burisma, whose owner had first been investigated during the Obama administration using U.S. funds.

Moreover, given the lingering questions about the extent to which the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee solicited Ukrainian officials for dirt on Trump during the 2016 election, it’s easy to see how any investigations into these matters would go beyond the narrow interests of Trump and encompass U.S. interests more broadly.

Democrats have painted themselves into a corner here, arguing that only their narrow interpretation of Trump’s motives is valid, when clearly there are other more plausible interpretations that are better supported by the facts.

Trump Versus the ‘Deep State’

One thing that emerged quite clearly from Wednesday’s hearing is that Taylor and Kent, and likely many other State Department officials, disagree with Trump’s view of Ukraine and have a quite separate policy agenda than the White House on Ukraine.

During his opening statements, Taylor talked about a separate, “irregular” diplomatic channel to Ukraine that included Rudy Giuliani, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and others. This irregular channel seems to have troubled Taylor.

But here again we come to the question of the president versus the bureaucracy. If Trump thought he needed a separate policy channel to pursue what he viewed as legitimate U.S. interests in rooting out corruption in Ukraine and getting to the bottom of what happened in 2016, that’s his prerogative as president—especially if he felt that the career bureaucrats at the State Department were not going to pursue these matters or take them seriously.

To take one example, Taylor said Wednesday he doesn’t think Ukraine owes the United States anything other than “appreciation.” Well, many Americans, including the president himself, might disagree with that. There are perfectly good reasons to think Ukraine, or any other country that receives U.S. aid, might owe the United States something more than “appreciation.” Maybe such countries also owe America some level of cooperation in advancing U.S. national interests—as defined by the president of the United States, not Ambassador Taylor or any other unelected bureaucrat.

This is in fact exactly how the Trump administration views the matter, which is likely the reason Trump and other administration officials have been so adamant that there was no quid pro quo. The administration’s interest in the Bidens and Burisma and 2016 election meddling appears to have been backward-looking, not forward-looking.

Trump wanted to know why the Bidens weren’t investigated and who in the Ukrainian government worked to undermine his 2016 campaign. Getting to the bottom of these things and ensuring they don’t happen again would be a reasonable condition to the receipt of hundreds of millions in security aid.

If Taylor and Kent and other State Department officials don’t agree with Trump about this, that’s fine. They are free to disagree. They are also free to be annoyed or even concerned about an “irregular channel” of Ukraine diplomacy. After all, the existence of such a channel itself is a sign that the president lacks confidence in State Department staff.

But Taylor went beyond expressing annoyance or concern in his testimony on Wednesday. He said this irregular channel of diplomacy was running “contrary to longstanding U.S. policy.” That’s a phrase he repeated several times, echoing the testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who said that in the spring of 2019 he became aware of “outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency.”

As Mark Hemingway has pointed out, in this context the “interagency consensus” appeared to be in opposition to the actual foreign policy of the United States, which is determined by the president, just as the “interagency consensus” opposed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria despite Trump having campaigned on a promise to do just that.

Taylor also claimed Wednesday that Ukraine is important to U.S. security, and that Russian aggression cannot stand. But Russian aggression was allowed to stand when Moscow invaded Georgia during the George W. Bush administration, and again when Russian troops occupied Crimea during the Obama administration. What was the “interagency consensus” back then, and why was Ukraine not considered important enough to U.S. security to prompt any pushback against Russia?

The answer is that the president sets foreign policy, not the unelected bureaucrats of the administrative state. So far, the entire impeachment inquiry hinges on this fact, and the more the American people get to see the impeachment debate play out in public hearings, the clearer it will become that Democrats are relying on an incredibly narrow and highly subjective interpretation of the facts to justify their claims that Trump tried to set up a quid pro quo with Ukraine.

Here’s How Impeachment Helps Democrats Even If They Fail,"After several years of writing about media bias and identity politics, I realized something pretty big that’s since clouded my every social and political thought. Today’s Democrat Party is a joke that would cease to exist if not for the unwavering support of the massively powerful corporate media.

Long before this revelation, it always amused me when people like Resistance Jake Tapper or others in the media would claim: “We don’t choose the stories. The stories choose us. All we’re doing is reporting what’s going on in the world. That’s our job.”

It amused me because they literally write the headlines. They choose exactly what stories to cover. As has become painfully obvious to anyone with a pulse, they also choose the narratives attached to those stories and how every twist and turn is characterized throughout the 24/7 news cycle.

If you couple those realities — that the media are nothing more than Democrats’ marketing arm, and that they’re responsible for deciding what we talk about and how it’s characterized — it becomes really hard to take “the news” seriously.

Yet I feel like I’m on an island under the weight of that reality. That’s because after watching our nation spend three years dignifying the preposterous notion that Donald Trump is a Russian spy who stole the 2016 election, I’m now watching us do the exact same thing with a fevered focus on hearsay witnesses to a phone call that we’ve all already read the transcript for.

It’s maddening. And every conservative media person and outlet, and every Republican advocate and official, and every Trump supporter and team member is just playing into the media’s (i.e. Democrats’) hand.

They don’t necessarily believe they’re going to impeach the president. They just want us talking about it nonstop because that means they’re controlling the narrative. Even if we’re “winning” the conversation, it’s still the conversation they want us having. This conversation is a disruptive cloud over Trump world and can slowly chip away at the stamina of any Independents or Democrats who might have been leaning toward working with or supporting him.

The good news is I think it’s having the opposite effect. I think most people see through the charade. As such, President Trump may very well gain support from one-time naysayers who might now sympathize with the persistently attacked, duly elected president of the United States.

But the vast majority of people, from long-time Trump supporters to recent converts, point their fingers at the Democrats as the primary source of the problem. And that’s just not accurate. You must know your opposition to defeat your opposition, so we must get our heads around the reality that it’s the powerful media, not the feckless and otherwise-toothless Democrats, who are our greatest enemy and threat.

Some people say the media aren’t biased. They say they’re just doing it for ratings. But if that’s the case, why isn’t U.S. Attorney John Durham’s name as widely recognized as former special counsel Robert Mueller’s was?

From the moment Mueller was appointed special counsel, the media wouldn’t stop talking about him. Every story they focused on, guest they had, and discussion they moderated was centered on Mueller and what he might or might not be doing and what that might or might not mean for Trump and everyone around him. Also flying in the face of claims that the media are just in it for ratings, every aspect was always characterized in the most negative terms possible for President Trump, his team, and his supporters.

But now we’ve got Durham doing a similarly massive and sensational investigation with nefarious national implications as far-reaching as Mueller’s, with exponentially more evidence-based plausibility, and they never even mention the man’s name, let alone what he’s working on. The focus instead is on what people you’ve never heard of thought about a phone call you already read the transcript of.

Imagine I told the world that you approached me on the street, beat me up, spit on me, and then walked away. And the whole world believed me. Then you released a video that showed the incident: I was walking down the street, you approached me, we chatted, shook hands, then went our separate ways.

Now imagine the media pretending that video didn’t exist. Instead, they spend the next several months breathlessly trotting out “witnesses” who claim to have heard about the incident and back up my story. Rather than accept the actual evidence, the media has the whole world ignoring it and focused like a laser on people who back up my lies about what you did.

Pretty infuriating, right? Well that’s what’s happening with the Ukraine phone call nontroversy.

The president of the United States is allowed to qualify the absence of corruption before handing over taxpayer dollars to a foreign nation, and running for president on the Democrat ticket doesn’t absolve someone from culpability in any such corruption. Full stop.

But the media are pretending not to understand any of those simple realities. They’re pretending the transcript doesn’t exist and that we need the opinions of unelected bureaucrats to tell us what happened. They’re pretending that President Trump doesn’t get to guide his own foreign policy. And they’re pretending that being a Democrat candidate for president is itself exculpatory, and that anyone who scrutinizes that candidate’s bad behavior is guilty of something possibly criminal and definitely impeachable.

Every minute of every day that we talk about the “Ukraine phone call” and the ridiculous “impeachment inquiry” attached to it, we’re letting the media win. We’re ceding the national conversation to them, regardless of how good we might feel about “winning” it.

Pretend you’re starving for food. You want to talk about getting yourself some food, but I take the conversation somewhere else by telling everyone you like to kick puppies. So you offer gobs of evidence that you don’t like to kick puppies and, as a result, everyone ends up believing you and thinking I’m a liar. Nice work. Now we can talk about getting you some food. Right?

Wrong. Because next I say that I was mistaken about the dog thing, but I have good evidence that you like to step on cats. In a sane world, at this point people wouldn’t believe me and we’d all talk about getting you some food.

But that’s how powerful the media are. Because now, instead of talking about getting you some food, we’re going to spend the next several months making you prove that you don’t like to step on cats. You might win that conversation also, but in the meantime you might die of starvation.

For most Republicans and conservatives, “starving for food” means celebrating individual liberty and renouncing the socialism that kills it, judging people by the content of their character rather than by their so-called identity, “draining the swamp” that for decades has served itself at our expense, and putting America first instead of attacking it or apologizing for it. None of those things will happen if we keep playing the media’s game.

It will take a strong, coordinated, major push from Republicans, conservative media, and the grassroots. But if we keep dignifying the notion that the feckless and wildly out-of-touch Democrat Party would have a leg to stand on without corporate media (they have to have lie about the application and mission of literally every policy they pursue), and we don’t recalibrate our firepower and ferocity entirely on that media, then all we’ll end up doing is dying of starvation a little more slowly.

We can’t let that happen. We must stop playing the media’s game.

"If Biden Wasn’t Impeached Over Quid Pro Quo, Trump Shouldn’t Be Either","The Latin phrase quid pro quo means “this for that.” Whereas these ten letters have become “dirty words” in the left’s lexicon, the phrase is the very foundation of a market economy, in which people trade goods and services based on the valuations buyers and sellers place on them.

Governments behave similarly. The United States values having a democratically elected government sans corruption on Russia’s doorstep. Ukraine values U.S. aid. A mutually beneficial exchange takes place when Ukraine values American aid more than corruption and the United States values a corruption-reduced Ukraine more than the dollars it must part with to secure it. This is all part and parcel of strategic efforts to secure U.S. interests abroad.

The seminal issue in play in the Ukraine controversy is whether this exchange served the public interest of the United States broadly defined, the private interest of President Trump in attempting to submarine the candidacy of Joe Biden, or some combination of the two. While the motives of the two parties will never be known with certainty, the case for impeachment on the merits is decidedly weak.

To put it succinctly, if Biden remained in office given his public pronouncements regarding the quid pro quo, transitivity argues that Trump should as well. That is, at least until the 2020 election, when the court of public opinion weighs in at the ballot box.

The Economics of Exchange

In a market economy, consumers allocate their scarce dollars to purchase goods and services to maximize their utility or satisfaction. Businesses produce the goods and services that consumers desire by securing inputs that generate more in revenues than they impose in costs.

When I purchase a car for $30,000, we may infer that I value the car more than I value the $30,000. Symmetrically, when the dealership sells me the car for $30,000, we may infer that it values my $30,000 more than the car that it sold me.

Sending U.S. aid abroad to elicit desired legal, business, and social behavior from foreign governments is really no different. The only question on the table insofar as Ukraine is concerned is whether the underlying motivation for the exchange was private or public interest?

Just as the managers of a corporation are agents of the shareowners, elected government officials are agents for the citizenry. As such, they are expected to carry out their duties that serve the best interests of the country—the so-called public interest. When elected officials serve their private interests instead, they are no longer good stewards of the public trust. In such circumstances, they may be removed from office by another branch of government or via free elections.

Blurring the Lines Between Private and Public Interest

When as vice president Biden publicly proclaimed on video that he was withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine until the prosecutor investigating his son’s company was fired, was he acting in the private interest of his family or in the public interest of the United States? Unfortunately, the two are not mutually exclusive.

It is not inconceivable that the Obama administration harbored legitimate concerns about the Ukrainian prosecutor. The question is whether the Bidens benefitted personally from the dismissal of this prosecutor as a direct product or merely as a byproduct of the quid pro quo?

Blurring these lines is not benign. To maintain the public trust, elected officials must not only avoid impropriety, they must also avoid the appearance of impropriety. At least on this latter score, Biden failed.

Likewise, President Trump, acting as an agent for the American people, has a legitimate interest in securing a corruption-free Ukraine. He could have stated in no uncertain terms to Ukranian President Zelensky that U.S. aid is contingent on eliminating corruption in their government and that means identifying and prosecuting any and all individuals regardless of party affiliation that are complicit in the corruption.

This statement would have cast a wide enough net to include the Bidens without identifying them specifically by name. The fact that Trump singled out Hunter Biden in the discussion blurred the lines between the public and the private interest, but only because Joe Biden is a potential presidential rival for Trump.

This is a non-issue if Joe Biden were merely a private citizen whose son was involved in questionable business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden does not warrant a free pass merely because he is running for president, nor does the president have license to invoke the power of the federal government to take out a political rival.

Nuance Needed, But Not Part of the Package

A more nuanced Trump would have found a way to motivate Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden as part of a larger corruption-eradication effort. Words do matter, and Trump is not as careful as he needs to be in parsing his.

This is unfortunate, but perhaps understandable. Trump did not work his way up to the presidency by winning a series of down-ballot elections. If he had, the rough edges that continually trip him up would have been smoothed over or he would have failed to advance. Nor did he work his way up to the presidency by climbing the corporate ladder and developing the diplomacy that is the sine qua non for such an ascent.

Trump’s path to the presidency was as unconventional as the man who occupies it. Working for change agents is never easy, precisely because they see the world differently, characteristically before the rest of the pack, and their relentless pursuit of the endgame invariably ruffles feathers along the way. To wit, for all of his creative genius, Steve Jobs would never have been anyone’s choice for boss of the year.

If Trump were more diplomatic he would unquestionably have less trouble with Congress, not to mention his cabinet. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is the antithesis of nuanced. He uses criticism as a form of political blood-doping; it energizes him.

Paradoxically, this may well explain why he is president. In electing Trump, the American people voted for the anti-politician in hopes of charting a different course for the country. It is perhaps not reasonable to ask Trump to be more artful in his discourse when he was voted into office precisely because he is not.

With both Biden and Trump, the lines were blurred between the private and the public interest. If nothing else, both men bear some culpability for failing to recognize that they were probably not the best choice to deliver the non-corruption message given the personal skin each had in the game. They failed to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

Transitivity of ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors’

There is ongoing debate as to whether Trump tied U.S. aid to the investigation of the Bidens, or to the eradication of corruption in the Ukraine more generally. This issue will not be resolved anytime soon, if ever. The transcripts of the phone calls with President Zelensky and the testimony before Congress will amount to little more than a political Rorschach test.

To impose a higher standard on Trump than Biden cannot be justified, particularly when Biden aspires to the office Trump now holds.

Biden tied U.S. aid to the dismissal of his son’s prosecutor, as video clearly attests. Did the U.S. have a vested interest in the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor that transcends his investigation into the business dealings of Mr. Biden’s son?

Did Trump and Biden put personal interest above public interest? We will probably never have definitive answers to that question. What we do know is that Biden was not investigated, impeached, nor forced to resign for his actions. Is it principled for Trump to be impeached or forced to resign when the weight of the evidence supporting a personal interest quid pro quo is arguably stronger for Biden than it is for Trump?

Transitivity argues that if Biden remained in office despite a stronger signal of a personal interest quid pro quo, then Trump should as well in light of the decisively weaker signal of such impropriety. To impose a higher standard on Trump than Biden cannot be justified, particularly when Biden aspires to the office Trump now holds.

This is not to suggest that Democrats will not attempt to apply a different standard to Trump, because they already have. Nonetheless, this is one of those gambles in which Democrats win big or lose big.

If the Ukrainian affair bears no more fruit than their claims of Russian collusion, the Democrats will not retake the presidency or the Senate and risk losing the House in the process. House Speaker Pelosi is in for the fight of her political life, but this is an old story that the veteran, crafty politician should know well. If you go after the king, you had better not miss. That said, Pelosi’s party looks increasingly like the gang who couldn’t shoot straight.

Americans Aren’t Stupid

The issue on the table is not whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors” however ill-defined these terms may be. The real question is whether behavior that has already been found not to constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” for one candidate can still be found to constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” for another candidate.

The American people are not stupid. In fact, they tend to exhibit uncommon wisdom and foresight at the presidential ballot box. If the past is prologue, Trump is well on his way to a second term while Biden won’t even be able to find his way to his own party’s nomination.

If there is a silver lining in all of this, it is that Congress is investigating prospective corruption rather than passing intrusive and economy-killing legislation. Had the 2016 presidential election been decided differently, corruption would be standard operating procedure.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/15/if-joe-biden-wasnt-impeached-over-a-ukraine-quid-quo-pro-trump-shouldnt-be-either/,2019-11-15
Impeachment Gives A Surging Pete Buttigieg An Opening,"The Democratic impeachment proceedings are poised to be a gift to South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

As Democrats chase their latest attempts to undo the 2016 election, a trial in the Senate is likely to keep several major top tier candidates off the campaign trail while continuing to weigh down the Biden campaign by keeping the former vice president’s shady business dealings with Ukraine in the spotlight.

House Democrats are aiming to hold a vote on impeachment by Christmas, forcing a trial in the Senate to come next year as the primaries get into full swing. Republican Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina said the trial could last six to eight weeks, which would require senators on the campaign trail, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, to spend a significant amount of time in Washington rather than in the early contest states as voting gets underway.

“I think it could be a problem,” said Paul Beck, a political science professor at The Ohio State University. “Iowa and New Hampshire require more of an on-the-ground commitment.”

Meanwhile, the field’s frontrunner has been plagued with scandal as the impeachment proceedings keep new revelations related to the corrupt nature of the Biden family’s involvement in Ukraine fresh in the public’s mind. Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for $50,000 a month despite having no prior experience in the industry while Joe Biden oversaw U.S. policy towards Ukraine. Even witnesses testifying in the House’s public impeachment hearings have made the case for investigating the arrangement.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday.

Recent polling shows Biden’s grip on his frontrunner status slipping in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, casting further doubt on the candidate’s ability to make it through the primary. The Biden team has even begun downplaying expectations in Iowa where the former vice president slipped to fourth place in three of the last four major polls conducted in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.

That leaves Buttigieg an opportunity to campaign in the critical early nominating contest states in the absence of major rivals, untouched by the impeachment drama unfolding in the nation’s capital.

Beck added that Buttigieg’s status as an outsider candidate may also stand to benefit the mayor, by distancing himself from the political establishment and the circus playing out in Washington.

“It frees him to say ‘hey, I’m not one of them,'” Beck said.

Buttigieg is already surging in Iowa, taking in first place in the latest poll conducted by Monmouth University. Now, the small town mayor is virtually tied with Warren as the Democratic frontrunner in the Hawkeye State with a slim 0.3 points away from eclipsing Warren’s lead.

Concern over Biden’s skid in the polls when coupled with the former vice president’s series of slip-ups this year increases anxiety among party elites worried about nominating a far-left candidate like Warren or Sanders who are polling second and third. The concern has prompted former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to make a last-minute entrance in the race this week likely joined by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who has not yet officially declared.

The addition of new rivals in the race have the potential to further chip away at Biden’s broad support, particularly in South Carolina where Biden’s lead is dependent on African-American voters as Patrick, an Obama-ally could begin to peel away this key constituent group.

While impeachment begins to sink the Biden campaign and keep senate rivals off the trail, Buttigieg will be better able to capitalize on the momentum throughout the next stage of the primary.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/15/impeachment-gives-a-surging-pete-buttigieg-an-opening/,2019-11-15
Another Democratic Star Witness Admits Trump Committed No Crime,"Another one of the House Democrats’ star witnesses testified before the House Intelligence Committee Friday in day two of the public portion of the partisan impeachment proceedings.

Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, admitted to lawmakers that President Donald Trump did not engage in any kind of criminal activity related to Ukraine.

“Do you have any information regarding the President of the United States accepting any bribes?” Republican Congressman Chris Stewart of Utah asked point blank.

“No,” Yovanovitch said.

“Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the President of the United States has been involved with at all?”

“No.”

Yovanovitch’s testimony comes amid Democrats’ latest attempt to undo the 2016 presidential election after the collapse of the Russian collusion hoax earlier this year.

Democrats launched official impeachment proceedings centered on the details of a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where Democrats allege Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden by withholding military aid.

The unredacted transcript of the call has since been declassified and released to the public in plain sight, revealing instead that Trump requested the Ukraine government root out corruption in its own country and investigate the origins of the nation’s involvement in peddling the Russian conspiracy theory that did irreparable harm to the United States.

Still, Democrats have aggressively pushed forward in their efforts to oust President Trump opening up impeachment proceedings that limit the rights of the minority party.

The impeachment process kicked off by Democrats have been wrought with bias from the start, first beginning with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff holding secret hearings in the basement of the Capitol. After more than a month of Democrats pre-interviewing witnesses and barring Republicans from asking questions Schiff did not want answered, the start of an official impeachment inquiry was put to the House floor for a full chamber vote where not one Republican supported the measure.

The rules for impeachment themselves prohibit Republican lawmakers from subpoenaing witnesses or evidence without Democratic approval. The minority party was granted these rights in both the Nixon and Clinton proceedings. And as was showcased in Friday’s hearings, Schiff has continued to suppress GOP voices on the committee.

Earlier this week, another one of the Democrats’ star witnesses made the case for investigating the Biden family’s involvement in Ukraine.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent Wednesday, who also raised the red flag to the Obama administration in 2015 that Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, was serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while the Vice President dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

Hunter Biden served on the board for $50,000 a month without any prior experience in the industry.

On Friday, Yovanovitch corroborated Kent’s testimony when asked by Republican John Ratcliffe of Texas whether she agreed with Kent’s earlier statements given to the committee.

“Yeah… I think that it could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest,” Yovanovitch said.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/15/marie-yovanovitch-admits-there-was-no-crime-no-bribery-from-trump-on-ukraine/,2019-11-15
Transcript Of Trump's First Call With Zelensky Blows Up Impeachment Narrative,"On Friday morning, the White House declassified and released the transcript of the first phone call between President Trump and then-Ukrainian President-elect Zelensky on April 21, in which Trump invited Zelensky to the White House.

The transcript disproves allegations, based on the July 25 phone call flagged in the whistleblower complaint, that Trump was withholding a White House meeting as leverage to get investigations into the Bidens or 2016 election meddling.

“When you’re settled in and ready, I’d like to invite you to the White House. We’ll have a lot of things to talk about, but we’re with you all the way,” Trump said on April 21 to Zelensky, after offering congratulations for his recent election. The conversation lasted 16 minutes.

The transcript of the April call reveals there was no discussion of withholding aid and that Trump had already invited Zelensky to the White House, rendering false the idea that he was withholding a meeting a few months later. Democrats calling for impeachment argue Trump was strategically withholding this meeting as “quid pro quo.” The new transcript reveals there is no evidence to support that argument.

When House Democrats released the testimony of a U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, last week, media outlets jumped on Taylor’s allegation of the leveraged White House meeting as a “second quid pro quo.”

Here’s how the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake described Taylor’s testimony:

A former Hillary Clinton adviser and director of an impeachment talking points website declared that this allegedly withheld meeting was a “bombshell.”

First, he confirmed that Sondland pressed Yermak on a quid pro quo during their Sept. 1 meeting. Second, he confirmed that Trump told Sondland that Ukraine had to open an investigation. These are BOMBSHELLS. — Zac Petkanas (@Zac_Petkanas) October 31, 2019

The White House released the new transcript just as former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch began her opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee Friday morning. In a previous deposition, Yovanovitch and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff speculated that Trump and Zelensky talked about her on the April 21 call and “bash[ed]” her.

As the transcript reveals, however, Yovanovitch was not mentioned even once in the April 21 phone call.

Americans Ignore Democrats' Demands To Watch Impeachment Farce,"Does anyone really believe the conclusion of Democrats’ impeachment “inquiry” isn’t predetermined? President Trump was guilty the moment he won the 2016 election — guilty of denying Democrats the massive spoils of federal power. Every moment since has just been searching for a pretext to remove him from office without an actual election. First Spygate, now the “impeachment inquiry.”

So it’s no surprise that just 13 million viewers tuned in for the first day of televised impeachment hearings last Wednesday, many fewer than for the Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford hearings last fall (20 million viewers) and for James Comey’s Russiagate testimony (19.5 million), according to early Nielsen ratings reported by Axios.

Since an estimated 304.5 million Americans have a television set at home, that means about 4.3 percent of them watched. For another comparison, a record 137.5 million Americans voted in 2016 and many millions more Americans are watching NFL games this fall (game viewership ranges between 10 and 23 million, with most at 13 million and up).

CNN legal analyst Jim Baker shook his finger at these naughty Americans on Twitter, insisting it’s our solemn obligation to watch Democrat-rigged impeachment theater as if we live in “1984” with Big Brother’s televisions always drilling into us what to think.

I’m sorry if some people think these hearings are boring. As American citizens we have a solemn obligation to pay attention to this process no matter what side you’re on. You’re not being asked to storm the beaches at Normandy after all. Suck it up and watch. — Jim Baker (@thejimbaker) November 13, 2019

On Friday, New York Times opinion writer Jennifer Weiner unleashed her inner schoolmarm. Apparently “I’m Sorry, Is Impeachment Not Entertaining Enough for You?” is the only messaging Democrats have left after actual evidence failed to surface for their latest set of wild anti-Trump claims.

Please excuse me while I recover from laughing at her claim that “It seems to some members of the media, impeachment is no longer about right and wrong, legal versus illegal. It’s about watchable versus unwatchable, enthralling and fun versus dusty and dry.” For this to be remotely plausible would require the American political media to give a thimble for facts versus innuendo.

Remember the “pee dossier”? What about the serial gang rapist who actually wasn’t nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court? Yeah, live those down, maybe even apologize for them, and then tell me about how your team cares about truth and justice.

Weiner’s solution to a chorus of “boring” after the hearings is, I kid you not: “The next time we see a partisan or a politician or, worse, a reporter complain that the hearings are boring, we push back. We point out that our political process is one thing and professional wrestling is another, and shame on anyone who faults the first for not resembling the second.”

So the people who wear vagina hats on their heads and brandish ridiculous red robes to demand that taxpayers pay to kill children are telling us that politics needs to look less trivial.

It’s also really rich to hear the team of Hollywood and BuzzFeed and deliberately addictive algorithms suddenly pretend to care about the citizenry’s attention spans and carefully cultivated appetites for gossip and slander over sober, reasoned reflection honed by years of careful study and experience. These are the people who want actual children to vote (only after they’re born, I guess) and whose response to every opposition argument is “You mother-effing, grandma-murdering RAAAAACISSST!”

Back in the real world, it’s not clear why logical, thoughtful Americans would tune in to these hearings. Not only are Democrats puppet-mastering the process to the point of banning Republicans from calling witnesses, viewing evidence, or asking questions, but 62 percent of voters say there’s no possibility of changing their views on impeachment, with another 19 percent saying there’s little possibility they’ll change their minds. This doesn’t sound like an open-minded process of impartial and deliberate reflection to me. It sounds like what it is: A witch hunt.

Before last week’s hearings, Democrats told media outlets they expected the show trials to shift public opinion in their direction. But voters’ low interest and predetermined views has instead confirmed their fears that even dramatic wall-to-wall TV coverage won’t make impeachment a win for them. Perhaps they’ve hit a ceiling on manufactured Trump hatred.

“In a private meeting this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top lieutenants were skeptical about the prospects of a dramatic shift in opinion even as public impeachment hearings began this week,” reported CNN Thursday. Later, the article releases a key nugget:

How impeachment plays in key districts has been an issue that Democrats have discussed repeatedly behind closed doors. At a meeting in late October, DCCC officials discussed focus group research that showed that voters wanted the inquiry to be a fact-finding mission — not a foregone conclusion, according to a source in the room.

The facts, however, show that Democrats have been primed for impeachment since Trump was elected. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., fed CNN the party line about impeachment for its Thursday story: “I’ll keep my mind open at the moment.” This is the same Jerry Nadler caught on the phone after the 2018 midterms plotting to impeach Trump over the Russian collusion hoax. When no evidence surfaced for that pretext for impeachment, Democrats found another in Ukraine.

It’s a risky strategy for them, to say the least. Looking at least as bad as Trump in the Ukraine narrative is Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden, who has to defend not only putting taxpayer funds on the table for international policy negotiation — a similar charge as the claimed one against Trump — but also his son’s personal enrichment.

If there ever is a real impeachment vote, Democrats have no hope of removing the president without a veto-proof majority. Even in that highly unlikely case, all they would accomplish is putting Mike Pence into the presidency.

What’s more, Republicans aren’t peeling off on Ukraine like they did on Russiagate; Democrats are.

Democrats appear to have jumped the shark here into taking a huge, avoidable political risk. All that’s really left to the imagination is how they’re ultimately going to retcon their failures.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/18/americans-ignore-democrats-demands-to-watch-their-impeachment-farce/,2019-11-18
Let’s Stop Pretending Every Impeachment Witness Is A Selfless Hero,"Throughout this impeachment charade we’ve been told by the media and House Democrats that a cadre of unelected career bureaucrats in the State Department and the National Security Council who are cooperating with the impeachment inquiry are heroes, patriots, and paragons of virtue and self-sacrifice for defying President Trump and proclaiming the truth about Trump corruption and self-dealing in Ukraine.

Last week, the media portrayed former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch as a courageous martyr recalled from her post by Trump for no reason and then viciously attacked by him on Twitter while she was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. Trump’s attack was immediately characterized as “witness intimidation” by House Democrats and the media, who played up the notion that Yovanovitch was a victim being punished for nothing more than her commitment to the truth.

We heard the same sort of praise for William Taylor and George Kent, the State Department officials who also testified last week, just as we’ve heard praise for all the career bureaucrats who have testified in closed-door sessions so far. Democrats and the media gave special praise to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the NSC Ukraine expert who told impeachment investigators he was alarmed by what he heard on the July 25 phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. As one of the only officials to have heard the call first-hand, Vindman was immediately hailed as a “star” witness in the impeachment probe, treated to glowing profiles in the New York Timesand the Washington Post, which said the Soviet émigré escaped to America with his family as a small child and grew up “determined to be as American as can be.”

But of course the truth is more complicated. We learned last week, for example, that the Obama White House knew Hunter Biden’s lucrative appointment to the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma less than a month after his father was made the administration’s point man in Ukraine looked bad—looked like corruption. The administration was concerned enough about it that it coached Yovanovitch on how to answer questions about the Bidens and Burisma that might come up in her 2016 Senate confirmation hearing. This only came out under close questioning by Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik.

https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1195410804973195264?s=20

And yet earlier in the hearing, Yovanovitch claimed that no one in the Obama administration “ever raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me.”

Then over the weekend we got a different perspective on Vindman. Transcripts of the closed-door testimony of Tim Morrison, former Russia and Europe director at the National Security Council, released Saturday by the House Intelligence Committee, reveal that Morrison had reservations about Vindman. He was concerned Vindman would “not exercise appropriate judgment as to whom he would say what,” and that when Morrison informed Vindman he wouldn’t be included in a trip to Ukraine, he made sure to have a witness in the room for that conversation.

Morrison: 'I had concerns that [Vindman] did not exercise

appropriate judgment as to whom he would say what.' But Republicans not allowed to pursue; might reveal hints about whistleblower. pic.twitter.com/rzIBaOrfP9 — Byron York (@ByronYork) November 17, 2019

Morrison further testified that Vindman was apparently concerned that not being included on the trip would make him less effective “because he would be seen by the interagency as not being relevant.”

In his closed-door testimony last month, Vindman had made reference to the “interagency consensus” about Ukraine policy—specifically, that the policies President Trump was pursuing through Rudy Giuliani, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, EU ambassador Gordon Sondland and others related to corruption in Ukraine ran counter to the “interagency consensus.”

But here we need to pause and ask whose policy priorities should count, the president’s or the career bureaucrats of the “interagency”? State Department diplomats and NSC experts serve at the pleasure of the president, not the other way around. What’s emerging in these hearings is an unmistakable attitude and ethos among career officials that their opinions and priorities about U.S. foreign policy should matter more than those of the president of the United States.

At the very least, House Democrats and the media should spare us the sanctimonious narrative that every impeachment witness is a selfless hero whose credibility is above questioning and whose every statement must be taken at face value. After all, we need look no further than the appalling display of other “deep state” bureaucrats connected to the Russia collusion hoax—former FBI director James Comey, his deputy Andrew McCabe, and the sneering former FBI agent Pete Strzok—for examples of craven, dishonest “deep state” bureaucrats who despise Trump and will seemingly do anything to undermine his administration.

Let’s not be surprised if some of the interagency figures now testifying in the House impeachment probe turn out to be just as dishonest, self-dealing, and contemptuous of the president’s authority to set U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine and determine what’s in the national interest.

White House Official Sues Politico For $25 Million Over Ukraine Story,"Trump White House Official Kash Patel filed a libel suit on Monday against Politico and one of its reporters for stories and tweets he claims falsely accuse him of “lying, deceit, and unethical conduct,” according to a Fox News report.

Patel, who currently serves as the National Security Council’s senior counterterrorism director, is seeking $25 million in damages. Patel’s suit directly names both Politico owner Robert Allbritton and Natasha Bertrand, a Politico reporter and MSNBC Contributor.

Patel claims the defendants “acted in concert” with Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., with the alleged aim of “destroy[ing] Kash’s reputation” in order to buttress “Schiff’s baseless Ukrainian quid pro quo hoax.” The articles in question, both penned by Bertrand, include one from October 23, titled “Nunes Protégé Fed Ukraine Info to Trump,” and another from October 30, titled “Testimony: Nunes acolyte misrepresented himself to Trump as Ukraine expert.”

At the center of the reporting is the contention that Patel, formerly an aide for Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., during the Intel Committee’s Russia investigation, was feeding President Trump damaging information on Ukraine. Bertrand reported in her October 23 piece that Patel “was among those passing negative information about Ukraine to President Donald Trump earlier this year, fueling the president’s belief that Ukraine was brimming with corruption and interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats.”

She further elaborated that, “Patel’s involvement demonstrates that the president had at least some support for the scheme from within the NSC,” usage of the word “scheme” seemingly indicating that whatever Trump had devised in relation to Ukraine was nefarious and Patel was distinctly involved. It also seems to establish a direct link between the Democrats’ allegations of a quid pro quo and the upper echelons of the national security apparatus.

In her October 30 piece, Bertrand reports that Patel, who was allegedly a critical voice on Ukraine, had nonetheless “misrepresented” himself as an expert on the country, to the point that President Trump mistakenly regarded him as the “NSC’s top Ukraine expert instead of Vindman.” In the same piece, Bertrand admitted, in reference to “negative material on Ukraine,” “It’s still not clear what materials Patel was giving Trump, or where he was getting them.”

But, Patel alleges, this specific stream of communication between Patel and Trump that Bertrand reported never actually took place. Patel states in his suit, “at no time” prior to October 30 “had Kash ever communicated with the president on any matters involving Ukraine. Kash never supplied any Ukraine ‘materials’ to the president.”

Bertrand’s reporting was derived from leaked accounts of the closed-door testimonies of both former NSC senior director Fiona Hill and the NSC’s Ukraine director Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Patel argues in his suit that neither Hill nor Vindman presented direct evidence that he actually briefed President Trump on Ukraine. This argument is confirmed from reading the later-released testimonies of both Hill and Vindman.

Indeed, from her testimony, it appears that Hill arrived at the conclusion that Patel was sending materials to President Trump based on a single “very brief interaction with the Executive Secretary,” which she later states was a staff member of the Executive Secretary and the interaction in question was “just an aside.” According to Hill, the staffer had stated that the President had wanted to set up a meeting with the NSC’s Ukraine director “to talk about some of the materials” and said that he or she would thus “be reaching out to Kash.” From Hill’s recounting, it seems no mention was made of whether Kash had sent the materials.

Furthermore, Hill declared she didn’t know “what kind of materials” and when questioned if she ever saw such materials, Hill responded, “I did not.” When questioned if she ever learned what materials Patel was passing along to President Trump, she responded, “I did not.” She did not follow up after reporting her concerns to Deputy National Security Advisor Charlie Kupperman.

Additionally, as revealed from Vindman’s testimony, Vindman had no firsthand knowledge of Patel’s relationship with Trump and only knew of the alleged “misrepresentation” through Hill.

Thus, at the base of Patel’s lawsuit is the notion that leaks may be dangerous for outlets that indiscriminately report on them before official sources are released. Patel’s suit argues that if Politico “had bothered to wait for the transcript, they would have learned that Hill completely fabricated the story that Kash had provided ‘materials on Ukraine’ to the president.” In the very least, waiting until the release of the transcripts would have thrown the veracity of Hill’s suspicions into a much more critical light.

While libel suits are traditionally difficult to win—and even more difficult if the individual suing is deemed a “public figure”—Patel’s lawsuit nonetheless shows that breathlessly publishing leaks, likely originating from partisan figures, may incur tangible costs, even if those costs are only to one’s reputation. Americans are growing increasingly distrustful of the media, and it’s not difficult to figure out why.

Patel’s lawsuit, regardless of the outcome, will likely strike many as a cathartic balm to the impeachment inquiry circus, which has been a frustrating confluence of closed-door hearings and seemingly selective “leaks.” As the ringleader of the circus, Adam Schiff is an additional target of Patel’s suit, Patel labeling the California representative “a demagogue with an ax to grind against the president.”

Thus, this lawsuit is not only about condemning establishment media but also about, as Howard Kurtz of Fox News points out, “put[ting] Adam Schiff’s handling of the impeachment inquiry itself on trial.” Whatever the outcome, it’s increasingly apparent that leaks have consequences.

Johnson: Impeachment An 'Effort To Sabotage The Trump Administration',"The Ukraine “impeachment inquiry” is “a concerted, and possibly coordinated, effort to sabotage the Trump administration,” wrote Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee Monday.

Johnson serves as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has made six trips to Ukraine since 2011. In the letter about his knowledge of the administration’s Ukraine policy, Johnson pushes back on the narrative being peddled by witnesses in the Democrats’ latest partisan impeachment efforts.

“I view this impeachment inquiry as a continuation of a concerted, and possibly coordinated, effort to sabotage the Trump administration that probably began in earnest the day after the 2016 presidential election,” Johnson wrote to Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Devin Nunes of California.

Johnson explains to Jordan and Nunes that he believes “a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style,” specifically calling out Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.

“It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile,” Johnson wrote.

Johnson’s knowledge of events related to the impeachment inquiry is significant. The senator even attended President Volodymyr Zelensky’s inauguration in Ukraine. His letter contradicted several key elements of testimony offered by witnesses testifying in the proceedings.

Gordon Sondland, for example, who serves as the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and is set to testify publicly this week, said in a private deposition that President Donald Trump ordered a delegation that included Sondland, Johnson, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and former diplomat Kurt Volker to work with Rudy Giuliani on matters involving Ukraine during a May 23 meeting. Yet Johnson says no such request was made during the meeting.

“I have no recollection of the president saying that,” Johnson wrote.

Johnson also notes that he was unaware of any arrangement in which Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine until the Ukrainians launched an investigation into the Biden family. In fact, Johnson writes that when the senator confronted the president on whether the military aid was being withheld until Ukraine took a requested action, as Sondland told Johnson, Trump firmly denied the accusation.

“I asked him about whether there was some kind of arrangement where Ukraine would take some action and the hold would be lifted,” Johnson wrote. “Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed,” adding that the president used multiple expletives.

Johnson asserted throughout the letter and to Ukrainian officials that Trump took issue with the rampant corruption engulfing Ukraine and chose a different approach from many in Congress and in the administration. The senator urged members in the administration to either work to carry out the president’s foreign policy agenda, since the president is constitutionally afforded the right to conduct U.S. foreign policy, or use their platforms to try to persuade the nation’s chief executive to amend his position, or resign.

“If those working for the president don’t feel they can implement the president’s policies in good conscience, they should follow Gen. James Mattis’ example and resign,” Johnson asserted. “If they choose to do so, they can then take their disagreements to the public. That would be the proper and high-integrity course of action.”

The public portion of the impeachment proceedings began last week with the testimony of three witnesses who failed to identify a crime committed by the president. Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine whom Trump fired in May, was asked point-blank whether Trump committed any crimes or engaged in bribery.

“Do you have any information regarding the president of the United States accepting any bribes?” Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah asked.

“No,” Yovanovitch replied.

“Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?”

“No.”

The impeachment proceedings were officially opened in late October when Democrats rubber-stamped rules for impeachment without a single Republican vote. Since then, Democrats have continued to hold closed-door hearings in secret and bar Republicans from using the information gather in private depositions in public questioning.

The rules of impeachment passed by House Democrats are also stacked against Trump, prohibiting Republicans from subpoenaing witnesses or evidence without Democratic approval. These rights were granted to the minority party in both the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/19/johnson-impeachment-inquiry-an-effort-to-sabotage-the-trump-administration/,2019-11-19
TV Impeachment Proceedings Have Been A Disaster For Democrats,"As the House moves into its second week of public impeachment hearings, Democrats are struggling to find incriminating evidence to justify the removal of the elected president, and the American people are not buying into their latest conspiracy theories to undo the 2016 election.

Last week, the House Intelligence Committee heard from three of the Democrats’ star witnesses on impeachment, including former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, the current U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent.

An initial glimpse at the coverage of the proceedings from the corporate media presents a startling situation for the White House. “Testimony puts Trump closer to scandal,” read one headline from the Washington Post. “Democrats land damning new evidence in testimony,” blasted a headline from Politico. “Testimony builds case against Trump,” reads another in the Los Angeles Times.

The most explosive revelations to emerge from three of the Democrats’ most important witnesses? That the Ukrainians were getting closer to rooting out corruption in their government and launching an investigation into the origins of its role in peddling the grand Russian collusion hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States.

Democrats and many in the mainstream media however, focused on the president’s request to investigate the Bidens as part of his overall push for corruption reduction. Trump’s opponents note that the president mentioned the Bidens in a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, arguing that the American president was directly conspiring with a foreign leader to investigate political opponents at home in order to receive military assistance.

Legacy media outlets have already sliced up the declassified and unredacted transcript of the phone call released to the public to fit the false narrative promoting the Democratic theory of a quid pro quo where Trump allegedly withheld military aid until a Ukranian investigation into the Biden family was launched. On air, CNN even skipped over 500 words to connect the word “favor” with the president’s suggestion that Ukraine look into Hunter Biden’s questionable business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company known to be highly corrupt.

The American people however, are not buying into Democrats’ latest scheme with a compliant media to oust the president from office. Polling on impeachment shows virtually no movement on the issue since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s opening of an investigation in September, and no signs of positive change for Democrats since the first public hearings on Wednesday.

If Democrats have any hopes of removing the president from office next year, they will need the support of Republican senators, but without Republican support in their home states, it is an impossible task. Every sane political observer already knows the outcome of the latest political charade playing out in Washington, where the Democrats will drag out the impeachment process only to have the president be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Democrats have begun to concede that their arguments are failing among the American people, and for good reason. Their own impeachment witnesses have exonerated the president and have provided further evidence for investigating the Bidens for their business in Ukraine.

During her testimony, Yovanovitch was asked point-blank whether Trump engaged in any criminal activity related to Ukraine.

“Do you have any information regarding the president of the United States accepting any bribes?” Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah asked.

“No,” Yovanovitch responded.

“Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?”

“No.”

Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine, actually built a case for investigating the Biden family. Kent told lawmakers he was concerned about a “perception of a conflict of interest” related to former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father oversaw the Obama administration’s policy towards Ukraine.

Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma for $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry. Kent had previously testified in a private deposition that he raised the alarm over the situation to the Obama White House in 2015 but it was cast aside by administration officials.

“The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation,” Kent told the committee.

The testimony provided by Democrats’ three star witnesses is hardly testimony useful to charge President Trump for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Meanwhile, Democrats have struggled to get their story straight. At first, they argued Trump offered the Ukrainians a quid pro quo. Now, the words “quid pro quo” are nearly non-existent, with Democrats and elites in the media using the terms “bribery” and “extortion” to describe the president’s actions.

As public opinion remains unmoved among party lines, it showcases that the American people can see right through the partisan games by Democrats who have spent three years even with help from the mainstream media trying to impeach the president as the top priority on their policy agenda, and it will likely pose electoral consequences next fall.

Vindman Exaggerated His Resume In Prepared Congressional Statement,"Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman was caught exaggerating his resume and his role in the White House to congressional lawmakers in Tuesday’s round of public hearings during the Democrats’ partisan impeachment proceedings.

Vindman previously claimed in his opening statement to be the “principal advisor to the National Security Advisor and the president on Ukraine and the other countries in my portfolio.”

When asked about the claim however by Republican Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, Vindman admitted to having never met, spoken with, or advised the president on anything.

“You’ve never spoken to the president and told him advice on Ukraine,” Turner said.

“That is correct,” Vindman said.

Turner also confirmed that Vindman was not asked to participate in meetings with U.S. officials in Ukraine when he traveled with a delegation to attend the inauguration of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Vindman also alleged in his written statement that Mayor Rudy Giuliani promoted false information undermining U.S. policy on Ukraine, only to again be forced to admit he has never met Giuliani.

“So you’ve never had a conversation with him about Ukraine or been in a meeting with him where he has spoken to other about Ukraine?” Turner asked.

“No, just when I saw his comments on TV…” Vindman said.

Vindman’s lie before the House Intelligence Committee comes as Democrats seek information to perpetuate their latest conspiracy theory to incriminate President Donald Trump on a “high crime and misdemeanor” warranting impeachment.

The televised public hearings however, have turned up no such evidence even after several of the Democrats’ start witnesses have appeared before the committee.

In fact, several witnesses have offered testimony to provide just the opposite.

Vindman Just Admitted To Leaking To The Anti-Trump Whistleblower,"Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman admitted to the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday to leaking information to the anti-Trump whistleblower at the center of the Democrats’ partisan impeachment proceedings.

“Lietenant Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25 phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25 or the 26 and if so, with whom?” Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California inquired.

“Yes. I did,” Vindman answered in the affirmative.

When pressed on who Vindman spoke with about the call, Vindman said he spoke with two individuals not in the White House, including Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent and another individual in the intelligence community that Vindman refused to name before being cut off by Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff.

“We need to protect the whistle-blower. Please stop. I want to make sure that there is no effort to out the whistle-blower through these proceedings,” Schiff interjected. “If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistle-blower, that is not the purpose that we’re here for. I want to advise the witness accordingly.”

Vindman testified under oath in a private deposition last month that he was unaware of who the whistleblower was. On Tuesday, Nunes pressed Vindman on how it is possible that he might out the whistleblower if he does not know the identity of the whistleblower.

“Per the advice of my counsel and the instructions from the chairman, I’ve been advised not to provide any specifics on who I have spoken to with inside the intelligence community,” Vindman said before being cut off by his own lawyer.

On Monday, Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin offered a written account of his own first-hand knowledge of the administration’s dealings with Ukraine, arguing that Vindman fits the profile of a Never-Trumper with an axe to grind.

As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has made six trips to Ukraine since 2011, Johnson’s knowledge of events surrounding Ukraine have been critical to the impeachment inquiry.

In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee conducting the investigation, Johnson rebuffed the false narrative being purported by Democrats and the media, writing that “a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style,” specifically calling out Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.

“It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile,” Johnson wrote.

In his testimony before lawmakers Tuesday, Vindman’s testimony offered few new facts to show President Donald Trump conspired with the Ukrainian government to investigate political opponents at home.

The Democrats’ public impeachment hearings have failed to provide incriminating evidence against the president for any “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Instead, they have come up with just the opposite, with several star witnesses offering testimony that exonerates the president and furthers the case to investigate the Biden family’s shady dealings with Ukraine.

Further, support for impeachment has dropped since the start of the hearing. According to a new poll conducted by Politico and the Morning Consult that was released Tuesday morning, opposition to the proceedings have hit their highest point since the newspaper began tracking public opinion on the issue. Today, 47 percent of independents oppose the impeachment proceedings whereas only 37 percent opposed the inquiry last week.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/19/vindman-just-admitted-to-leaking-to-the-anti-trump-whistleblower/,2019-11-19
Vindman Was Asked Three Times To Be Defense Minister Of Ukraine,"Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman testified before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday that the Ukrainians approached the American national security official about serving the European nation as the defense minister a total of three times.

When questioned by the Republican’s Intelligence Committee counsel, Vindman said it was when he went to Ukraine earlier this year for President Volodymyr Zelensky’s inauguration that he turned down multiple offers to be Ukraine’s Minister of Defense.

“Every single time, I dismissed it,” Vindman asserted. “Upon returning, I notified my chain of command and the appropriate counterintelligence folks about this, the offer.”

Vindman said it would have been a “great honor” to serve in the position but added that he maintained that his loyalties lied with the United States and said he never left the door open to taking the foreign job.

Lt. Col Vindman says that Ukraine repeatedly offered him to be the Minister of Defense for Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/NBr1Z0nPNU — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) November 19, 2019

Vindman’s testimony has offered little new evidence to show President Donald Trump committed any kind of “high crime and misdemeanor” that warrants impeachment, revealing instead Vindman’s personal feelings about what transpired in a July phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, the unredacted transcript of which has since been declassified and made public.

Vindman repeated again and again before lawmakers that he was concerned about what he felt was a quid pro quo given by Trump to the Ukraine government where the president withheld military aid to the eastern European nation in exchange for an investigation into the Biden family.

A reading of the transcript however, reveals no such offer, and instead shows Trump urging Ukraine to get to the bottom of their involvement in peddling the grand Russian conspiracy theory launched against Trump that did irreparable harm to the United States. Trump also pushed the Ukraine government to weed out corruption in its own country.

Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who possesses a deep understanding of the events surrounding the administration’s handling of Ukraine as chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the House Intelligence Committee Monday that Vindman fit the profile of a Never-Trumper working within the government to subvert the administration’s policy agenda.

“A significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style,” Johnson wrote in a letter to the committee. “It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile.”

Democrats’ public impeachment hearings have done nothing to further the partisan case to oust the president and instead have only exonerated the president and provided more testimony to justify an investigation into the Biden family’s highly questionable business dealings in Ukraine.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified Friday that she had no information that the president engaged in any kind of criminal activity.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified Wednesday told lawmakers that he was concerned about the “perception of a conflict of interest” related to Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while Joe Biden dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

"Volker, Morrison Testimony Obliterate Democrat Case For Impeachment","Former State Department Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker offered testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday that completely exonerated President Donald Trump in the Democrats’ partisan impeachment inquiry.

Volker, who resigned from his post at the end of September, told lawmakers there was no bribe, no extortion, and no quid pro quo involved with the administration’s dealings with Ukraine.

“Mr. Zeldin asked you in the deposition that in no way, shape or form in either readouts from the United States or Ukraine did you receive any indication whatsoever, or anything that resembled a quid pro quo, is that correct?” asked Republican counsel Stephen Castor during the hearing.

“That’s correct,” Volker said. “I was never involved in anything that I would consider to be bribery at all…or extortion.”

Volker’s comments came after the testimony of former National Security Council Staffer Tim Morrison, the Trump administration’s top Russia advisor in the White House until his resignation before his private deposition last month.

Morrison testified there was no bribery tied to military aid with Ukraine, the basis for which the Democratic impeachment efforts are built upon.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?” asked ranking Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California.

“No,” said Morrison.

Nunes posed the same question to Volker, who also said “No.”

In October, Volker had already testified in a private deposition that there was no such “quid pro quo” or “bribery,” destroying the narrative pushed by Democrats and the mainstream media where Trump allegedly pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate the Biden family in exchange for the release of withheld military aid.

Volker and Morrison’s testimony come on the third day of public impeachment hearings, where Democrats have struggled to find incriminating evidence to convict Trump of a “high crime and misdemeanor” required to remove the president from office.

Last week, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified that she had no information that Trump participated in any kind of criminal activity whatsoever.

Since the start of open impeachment hearings, public support for the proceedings have dropped. According to a new poll released from Politico and the Morning Consult, 47 percent of independents opposed the impeachment inquiry, whereas only 37 percent of independents were opposed at the beginning of last week.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/19/volker-morrison-testimony-completely-vindicate-trump-destroy-democratic-case-for-impeachment/,2019-11-19
Day Three Of Impeachment Proceedings Was Train-Wreck For Democrats,"The House Intelligence Committee wrapped up day three of the public portion of its partisan impeachment proceedings Tuesday with far from expected results for House Democrats desperately hoping to land a knock-out blow to the president. Four witnesses testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and each failed to provide incriminating evidence of a “high crime and misdemeanor” by the president.

The day began with Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, a vice presidential advisor on Europe and Russia. Both morning witnesses had listened to the now infamous July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s president.

Williams characterized the call as “unusual and inappropriate,” and Vindman testified that the phone call was itself clear evidence of wrongdoing worthy of presidential removal. Neither witness, however, offered new substantial facts in the case against the president proving any kind of a quid pro quo. They merely offered their feelings of concern over what they heard on the July phone call, an unredacted transcript of which has now been declassified and released to the public.

Vindman in particular, whose testimony Democrats and many in the media have honed in on as the most damaging to the president despite contributing little of substance to the proceedings, undercut his own credibility multiple times throughout his testimony.

For one, Vindman exaggerated his resume in his opening statement, claiming to have been the “principal advisor to the National Security Advisor and the president on Ukraine and the other countries in my portfolio.” When pressed on the assertion later in his testimony, Vindman was forced to admit that he had never met, spoken with, or advised the president on anything.

“You’ve never spoken to the president and told him advice on Ukraine,” Ohio Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio inquired.

“That is correct,” Vindman said.

Vindman also essentially admitted to leaking information to the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment probe, providing further evidence of Vindman as a deep-state operative seeking to undermine the president’s policy agenda.

When California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes asked Vindman who he spoke with about the July phone call between Trump and the Ukraine president, Vindman mentioned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and another unnamed individual within the intelligence community that Vindman was cut off from naming by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California.

“We need to protect the whistleblower. Please stop. I want to make sure that there is no effort to out the whistleblower through these proceedings,” Schiff interjected.

In the afternoon, members of the House Intelligence Committee heard from former State Department Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Council Staffer Tim Morrison, both of whom resigned their government posts prior to their private depositions in front of the committee.

Both witnesses offered testimony Tuesday that cut right through the crux upon which the entire Democratic case of impeachment is built, which alleges Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation on the Biden family.

Volker and Morrison were each asked point-blank by Nunes whether either had been involved in any kind of bribery or extortion, both of whom answered with an authoritative “no,” and repeated their assertions that they had not seen anything resembling a quid pro quo multiple times throughout their testimony fielding the same question from several lawmakers.

“I was never involved in anything that I would consider to be bribery at all…or extortion,” Volker declared.

“Kind of hard to prove a corrupt quid pro quo theory when the key U.S. policy people, plus the Ukrainians, were never aware of such an arrangement,” tweeted Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, noting that even the Ukrainian president reported feeling no pressure from Trump to investigate the Bidens. “Can we go back to governing now, that’d be great thanks.”

To make matters worse for Democrats, Morrison’s appearance before the committee further undermined Vindman’s earlier testimony, highlighting Vindman’s poor judgement and insubordination on the NSC by circumventing Morrison on key policy matters. Morrison’s testimony on Vindman corroborates Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s characterization of Vindman earlier this week as a Never-Trump bureaucrat who never accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.

Johnson, who chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has made six trips to Ukraine since 2011, submitted a letter to the House Intelligence Committee Monday detailing his knowledge of the events surrounding the White House dealings with Ukraine and called out Vindman by name.

“A significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style,” Johnson wrote to the committee. “It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile.”

A new Politico/Morning consult poll released Tuesday morning spells more trouble for Democrats proceeding with their latest efforts to undo the 2016 election. According to the survey, 47 percent of independents now oppose the impeachment inquiry, a ten-point increase from the 37 percent of independents who opposed the investigation last week prior to the public hearings.

“Voter opposition to the impeachment inquiry is at its highest point since Morning Consult and POLITICO began tracking the issue,” said Morning Consult’s Vice President Tyler Sinclair.

"Pence, Perry, Pompeo Reject Sondland’s Impeachment Testimony","Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo each categorically denied EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s claims that the three White House officials were aware of Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in a quid pro quo for military aid.

During testimony delivered to the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday on day four of the Democrats’ latest round of partisan impeachment hearings, Sondland said he informed each, Pence, Perry, and Pompeo that the ambassador raised concerns about the president withholding aid to Ukraine as part of a quid pro quo to investigate the Biden family, the central issue at the heart of the Democratic impeachment inquiry.

“I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in [US military aid to Ukraine] had become tied to the issue of investigations,” Sondland told lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

The vice president’s office however, denied the conversation ever took place.

“The vice president never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based on potential investigations,” said Pence Chief of Staff Marc Short in a statement.

“Multiple witnesses have testified under oath that Vice President Pence never raised Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden, Crowdstrike, Burisma, or investigations in any conversation with Ukrainians or President Zelensky before, during, or after the September 1 meeting in Poland,” Short pointed out.

Energy Secretary Perry also pushed back on Sondland’s assertion that he too, was informed of an apparent quid pro quo being put in place by Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani.

“Ambassador Sondland’s testimony today misrepresented both Secretary Perry’s interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the Secretary received from President Trump,” an Energy Department spokesperson said in a statement. “As previously stated, Secretary Perry spoke to Rudy Giuliani only once at the President’s request. No one else was on that call. At no point before, during or after that phone call did the words ‘Biden’ or ‘Burisma’ ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry.”

Pompeo’s team also issued a statement rejecting Sondland’s accusations.

“Gordon Sondland never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the president was linking aid to investigations of political opponents. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false,” State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.

Sondland’s testimony before the committee was paraded by Democrats and the media as the most damning testimony to date, where Sondland implicated a wider range of White House officials to include Pence, Perry, and Pompeo as complicit in Trump’s alleged scheme to conspire with a foreign leader to investigate political opponents at home.

However, Sondland also testified Trump was very clear with the ambassador that Trump wanted no quid pro quo with Ukraine.

During a candid conversation with President Trump on what the president wanted from Ukraine, Sondland told lawmakers that Trump explicitly said “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.”

https://twitter.com/RepRatcliffe/status/1197254280731906050?s=20

Later in his testimony, Sondland also advanced the case to investigate the Biden family over what appeared to be a conflict of interest where former Vice President Joe Biden’s son served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while Joe Biden dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

“Clearly it’s an appearance of a conflict of interest,” Sondland told New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik when pressed on whether the situation raised any red flags.

Burisma Founder Under Investigation For Embezzlement Of Over $30 Million,"Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka announced earlier today that the government would be expanding its investigation into Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky to include possible embezzlement of state funds, according to Reuters and The Daily Caller.

Burisma is the Ukrainian natural gas company whose board Hunter Biden served on from April of 2014 until April of this year, earning a reported salary of $50,000 per month, despite having zero experience in the energy sector.

Ukrainian officials are currently unable to locate Zlochevsky, who is suspected of embezzling the equivalent of $33 million in state funds while serving as the country’s ecology and natural resources minister from 2010 to 2012.

Prior general prosecutors managed a variety of investigations into the Burisma founder, stemming from allegations related to tax violations, money-laundering, and licenses awarded to Burisma while Zlochevsky was serving as ecology minister. The latest announcement by Ryaboshapka reveals that embezzlement of state funds may now be added to the list of possible crimes. Ryaboshapka’s declaration was prompted after lawmakers in a prior press conference leaked a document from the general prosecutor’s office related to the investigation.

The latest news of an expanded probe into the Burisma founder coincides with the impeachment inquiry hearings, which the Democrats are conducting to determine if President Trump withheld aid from Ukraine in return for an investigation into Zlochevsky’s Burisma, as well as into Joe and Hunter Biden. The announcement comes on the heels of Democrats perpetually urging the public that the Bidens engaged in no wrongdoing while conducting activities in Ukraine.

Undoubtedly, given that the time period of the potential embezzlement precedes the arrival of the youngest Biden, the media and Democrats will leap on this chain of events as vindication or “proof” that Hunter Biden was not involved in corrupt activities abroad and that Joe Biden did not offer informal leverage for his son. However, it’s entirely possible that Burisma sought Western figures with clout-carrying names like “Biden” to shield the company from undergoing too rigorous an investigation after the potentially corrupt activities unfolded. This theory becomes particularly poignant when considered in light of Joe Biden’s speech, in which he bragged about having the then-general prosecutor of Ukraine fired, allegedly under the banner of a widespread anti-corruption campaign he carried out during his tenure as vice president.

As The New York Times shared in May, Hunter’s appointment to the board of Burisma, in the very least, was advantageous for suggesting to the world that the Ukrainian energy sector was beginning to address its own rampant corruption. “Their [Hunter Biden and others’] support allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans at a time when Ukraine was especially dependent on aid and strategic backing from the United States and its allies, according to people who worked in Ukraine at the time,” the Times reported.

The direct advantage Hunter’s retainment gave to Burisma is still unknown. Still, journalists will likely find this recent information highly exculpatory, despite the fact that Hunter could have just as easily served as a Western balm to a highly invasive and expensive investigation. As the Democrats continue to rail against Trump for a phone call made transparent by an actual transcript, the latest allegations against Zlochevsky reveal a whole world of corruption that remains largely unknown to Congress — and one Hunter Biden had immeasurable connection to.

Gordon Sondland’s ‘Bombshell’ Impeachment Testimony Was A Dud,"It was the testimony that was supposed to bring an end to the Trump administration as we knew it, finally completing Democrats’ three-year mission to undo the results of the 2016 presidential election.

Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday that President Donald Trump criminally leveraged the power of the Oval Office to pressure a foreign entity to investigate political opponents at home by tying military aid and a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president to an investigation into the Biden family in a quid pro quo.

“I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: was there a ‘quid pro quo’? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,” Sondland declared in his opening statement, affirming the Democrats’ latest conspiracy theory seeking the removal of the president.

At first glance, it was a day of damning testimony for the president, and the media ran wild with headlines spelling out Armageddon for the Trump White House.

“Sondland Delivers for Democrats With Bombshell Testimony,” reads a headline in U.S. News and World Report. “Sondland’s bombshell testimony blows holes in Trump’s Ukraine defence,” reads another in The Guardian. “Sondland’s bombshell testimony leaves Trump’s Republican allies scrambling,” declares the Washington Post.

The “bombshell testimony” Sondland offered, however, failed to explode anything on the Trump administration. Sondland, who has already changed his testimony multiple times since sitting down behind closed doors for a private deposition, admitted to lawmakers Wednesday that his accusations of a clear quid pro quo were based entirely on assumptions about Trump and the president’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

“Mr. Sondland, let’s be clear: no one on this planet—not Donald Trump, Rudy Guiliani, Mick Mulvaney, Mike Pompeo—no one told you aid was tied to political investigations, is that correct?” Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio asked.

“That’s correct,” Sondland said.

In fact, Sondland confirmed to the committee that Trump explicitly told Sondland that Trump did not want a quid pro quo on anything regarding Ukraine.

“I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,” Sondland says Trump told Sondland.

https://twitter.com/RepRatcliffe/status/1197254280731906050?s=20

During his public testimony on Capitol Hill, Sondland also accused Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, without any hard evidence and relying on personal recollection, of being aware of the president and Giuliani’s alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine after Sondland raised his concerns over the apparent situation.

Pence, Perry, and Pompeo each denounced the claims as false, refuting Sondland’s testimony that meetings ever took place in which Sondland confronted the vice president and senior cabinet officials of a quid pro quo.

Sondland’s “bombshell” testimony, based on presumptions and new accusations without evidence, have been further contradicted by several prior witnesses who appeared before the committee. On Friday, former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, one of the Democrats’ star witnesses who testified last week, admitted that she had no information that Trump was involved in any criminal activity whatsoever.

On Tuesday, Sondland’s charges of a quid pro quo were flatly disputed by former State Department Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Council Staffer Tim Morrison, both of whom resigned their government posts before sitting for their private depositions in the committee.

Volker and Morrison were each asked point-blank whether there was any bribery or extortion, i.e., quid pro quo, pushed by the White House on Ukraine.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?” asked ranking Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California to each witness.

“No,” they each said, without hesitation.

Sondland’s appearance on Capitol Hill also gave credence to a potential congressional investigation of the Biden family’s shade business dealings with Ukraine.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company known to be highly corrupt, making $50,000 a month while his father, Joe Biden, served as vice president at the time and controlled U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

When pressed on whether the situation appeared to be a conflict of interest by Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, Sondland agreed.

“Clearly it’s an appearance of a conflict of interest,” Sondland told the committee.

Certainly, testimony from a witness who has already changed his story multiple times and offered claims based only on personal recollection of events contradicted by other witnesses made for quite an explosive day for the Trump White House in the Democratic impeachment saga.

Media Acknowledged Ukrainian Meddling Until It Hurt Impeachment Efforts,"As the endless impeachment hearings drag on, congressional Democrats and the mainstream media are pushing the narrative that Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election is a fictitious theory. But that’s not what they said just after President Trump won the election.

“It’s not just that [Trump] subverted U.S. policy for this fictitious theory about Ukrainian meddling in the election. Which, by the way, the absolute, unanimous conclusion is it was Russia, not Ukraine, is a conclusion based on fact.” CNN’s Andy McCabe said.

CNN’s Andy McCabe: “Fictitious theory” Ukraine meddled in 2016 election pic.twitter.com/1iGT2J8p6X — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) November 21, 2019

However, the corporate leftist media were the ones that initially reported on Ukraine’s meddling in the 2016 election. Now, those facts contradict their narrative, which means we must ignore them.

Lucky for us, the internet doesn’t scrub their former reporting away. So, here are five times these outlets reported on Ukrainian meddling as fact.

1. Financial Times, 08/28/2016

The Financial Times reported Ukraine attempted to intervene in the U.S. election.

“The prospect of Mr Trump, who has praised Ukraine’s arch-enemy Vladimir Putin, becoming leader of the country’s biggest ally has spurred not just Mr Leshchenko but Kiev’s wider political leadership to do something they would never have attempted before: intervene, however indirectly, in a US election,” Financial Times reported.

2. Politico, 01/11/2017

Politico reported the Ukrainian government tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump.

“Ukrainian government official tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election,” Politico reported.

They also reported that a Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C. in an effort to expose ties between Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russia.

3. Financial Times, 12/22/2016

The Financial Times reported Russia used Ukrainian technology to hack the DNC server in the 2016 election. Based on the reporting, it appears the technology used to hack the election was operated in eastern Ukraine.

4. Politico, 02/23/2017

In 2017, Politico reported that a Ukrainian parliamentarian attempted to contact Manafort claiming to have politically damaging information about Manafort as well as Trump.

“The undated communications, which are allegedly from the iPhone for Manafort’s daughter, include a text that appears to come from a Ukrainian parliamentarian named Serhiy Leschenko, seeking to reach her father, in which he claims to have politically damaging information about both Manafort and Trump,” Politico said.

5. New York Times, 12/12/2018

Ukranian courts ruled that releasing information to Manafort about the 2016 U.S. election was illegal interference.

“Both lawmakers asserted that if the release of the slush fund information broke the law, then it should be viewed as an illegal effort to influence the United States presidential election in favor of Hillary Clinton by damaging the Trump campaign,” the New York Times reported.

The mainstream media that is today claiming Ukrainian meddling is a “fictitious theory” is the same mainstream media that reported on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election just a few years ago. It appears the only thing that can account for this change is the question: What narrative can we use to get Trump?

"Under Obama, Democrat Witness Fiona Hill Argued Against Lethal Aid For Ukraine","During the Democrats’ partisan impeachment hearings on Thursday, their witness Fiona Hill, a former White House official, testified she was concerned that a hold on aid might endanger Ukraine’s security. But in 2015, Hill penned an op-ed in the Washington Post arguing that providing lethal weapons to Ukraine would be a mistake.

In both her closed-door testimony last month and her public hearing on Thursday, Hill said she was concerned about Ukraine’s safety and stability as it defends itself against Russia should President Trump continue to withhold aid. But while she was the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution a few years prior, Hill wrote an op-ed titled “How aiding the Ukrainian military could push Putin into a regional war,” in which she strongly disagreed with the idea that “increasing the Ukrainian army’s fighting capacity … would allow it to kill more rebels and Russian soldiers.”

“It is hard to find effective alternatives to the current sanctions policy, but if we plunge headlong into sending weapons, we may lose our allies, and we may never have the opportunity to get things right,” Hill wrote.

Other witnesses who testified before the House Intelligence Committee admitted that Trump’s policy of denying lethal defensive assistance to the Ukrainians has been more effective than President Barack Obama’s policies in Ukraine and Russia.

Vindman's Impeachment Testimony Displays His Open Insubordination,"During his impeachment hearing testimony this week, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman has reminded us of the need for the military to stick to its governing principles. Those principles would guard against dishonorable partisan moves such as Vindman’s appearance before the House Intelligence Committee in his military attire merely to squabble over his bureaucratic disagreement with Trump’s foreign policy, or his gross exaggeration of his political resume in his opening statement.

The military governs itself by two fundamental principles. One of those bedrock principles governing military-civilian relations is the rule that active-duty military officers must avoid participating in partisan politics. Thus, for example, serving officers may attend political rallies or functions but may not do so while in uniform.

A second of these bedrock principles is that officers do not publicly question or undercut the orders or official policies of superior officers in their chain of command. This principle is paramount from the platoon level to the highest levels in the Pentagon. As Gen. Douglas MacArthur learned, even a five-star general may not publicly question the orders or policies of the president.

MacArthur was properly relieved after he criticized President Harry S. Truman’s Korean War policies. The proper role of any officer, whether a general or a lieutenant colonel, is to offer his best advice and then obey the orders and policies of the officers appointed over him without complaint or dissent once the president has decided.

These principles are fundamental because they are essential to a proper relationship between a professional military and a government dedicated to civilian control and supremacy over the military. Violations strike at the foundation of civil-military relations in this country and risk grave damages.

When officers violate these fundamentals, they risk sacrificing their credibility as officers and the support of the American public. Today, if the military weighs in on the one side or the other of the omnipresent partisan warfare, they will doubtless risk a loss of credibility and confidence by one-half of the country.

These two principles intersect when a serving officer publicly and gratuitously questions the policies of his commander in chief and in a partisan political setting. In such case, the risk of harm to military-civil relations and to the country is magnified. That is, regrettably, the case with Vindman’s testimony.

Vindman Admits His Disagreement Is Petty Politics

We now have the published transcript of Vindman’s deposition testimony, which was taken behind closed doors after his voluntary publication of his gratuitous opening statement. That previously secret testimony shows his violation of these two principles governing proper military-civil relations in a democracy. This is because Vindman’s questions and answers made clear he simply disagreed with the way the president was administering his chosen foreign policy.

Vindman testified he thought it was “inappropriate” for President Trump’s emissary, Rudy Giuliani, to ask Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s dealings with Burisma, which he acknowledged was a “corrupt” company. So even though, according to Vindman, the president’s personal emissary was asking the Ukrainians to conduct such an investigation of a company widely acknowledged to be corrupt, and the younger Biden was earning almost $1 million a year as a board member without any discernible qualifications, and even though Vice President Joe Biden had been the Obama administration’s point man in connection with Ukraine, this lieutenant colonel’s personal opinion was that such an investigation was “inappropriate and that we were not going to get involved in investigations” (30-31).

Vindman, therefore, de facto overruled Giuliani’s overtures because Vindman thought “this would not be a fair investigation, and it would provide, you know, compromising or maybe even fabricated information, if need be” (33).

Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, properly questioned Vindman about whether his testimony was simply about non-impeachable policy disagreements or he had knowledge of potentially impeachable criminal acts. Vindman attempted to deflect and evade the questions, and Ratcliffe politely pressed on.

Vindman finally admitted he did not know of “a crime or anything of that nature.” But he “made a moral and ethical judgment” that he thought it was “wrong” and that he “also had deep policy concerns” (155).

Vindman’s Move Could Set a Bad Precedent

Vindman knew what the president’s policy and desire was. He did not like that policy. He also did not like the way the policy was being implemented through the president’s personal emissary, whom he referred to as an “outside influencer” (21-22). So Vindman decided to thwart that policy. And now he has testified — and is expected to testify again — to offer his personal disagreement and criticism of his commander in chief’s policy.

When subpoenaed, Vindman had several honorable options. He could have answered factual questions honestly, eschewing any voluntary opinion testimony. He could have resigned his position and commission and appeared in civilian clothes to offer his opinions about morals and ethics and what he considered to be a wise foreign policy.

What he could not properly do, while on active duty and in uniform, was appear and volunteer his testimony impeaching the policies and desires of his commander in chief. That voluntary act strikes at the heart of the delicate balance between sound military advice and involvement in partisan politics.

Vindman’s testimony risks setting a bad precedent, and the military should nip it in the bud. There is ample precedent for doing so. In 1994, a highly decorated combat Marine, Col. John Ripley, was the senior Navy ROTC instructor at the Virginia Military Institute. The U.S. government had sued VMI to require it to admit women.

VMI subpoenaed Ripley to testify to his opinions based upon his vast experience in combat and as the senior Marine at the United States Naval Academy and instructor at VMI. Ripley was an American hero. He had been awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star, two Bronze Stars for Valor, and the Purple Heart. In 1994, his opinions differed from those of President Bill Clinton and his administration.

But despite Ripley’s nonpareil military background, the Clinton administration ordered him not to testify to any opinions but to limit his testimony to facts. Ripley obeyed that order. So, too, should Vindman, if he is given such a lawful order.

"Grassley, Johnson Demand Materials From FBI On 2016 DNC Contractor","Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin are demanding information from the FBI related to former Democratic National Committee (DNC) contractor Alexandra Chalupa and her efforts to seek dirt on the Trump campaign from Ukraine.

Politico reported that in 2016, Chalupa met with an official from the Ukrainian embassy for information that could undermine the Trump campaign.

According to Yahoo News, Chalupa was also the target of a cyberattack during her time at the DNC, prompting FBI investigators to interview her and take digital forensic images of her laptop and smartphone.

“If this reporting is accurate, it appears that the DOJ and FBI have in their possession material relevant to our Committees’ ongoing investigation into collusive actions Chalupa and the DNC took to use foreign government sources to undermine the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” Grassley and Johnson wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

The demands for the FBI’s relevant records on Chalupa come in the midst of a House impeachment inquiry centered on President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. Democrats have alleged Trump conspired with his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate political opponents at home in exchange for military aid in an apparent quid pro quo.

A July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky kicked off the impeachment proceedings. An unredacted transcript of the phone call, which has now been declassified and released to the public, shows that the president in reality urged Zelensky to weed out corruption in his own country and investigate the origins of Ukraine’s involvement in peddling the Russia collusion hoax that did irreparable damage to the United States.

As part of their latest efforts to undo the 2016 election through impeachment, Democrats have argued that Ukraine’s involvement in promoting the Russian collusion conspiracy theory are unfounded and are serving as a distraction to the president’s ulterior motives: leveraging the power of the Oval Office to dig up dirt on the Biden family.

Ukraine’s involvement in pushing the false Russian collusion narrative is well-documented, however, and Grassley and Johnson’s request for records is likely to shed further light on Ukraine’s election meddling.

The Republican senators have given the Justice Department a deadline of Dec. 9 to meet their demands.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/22/grassley-johnson-demand-materials-from-fbi-on-ukrainian-dnc-contractor-in-2016/,2019-11-22
How Republicans Won Phase One Of Impeachment,"With the likely conclusion of Rep. Adam Schiff’s impeachment proceedings, it’s worth taking a step back and looking at how things went for the majority Democrats and minority Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Democrats ideally would have started their inquiry with credible bipartisan support and run things in such a way that public opinion developed in their favor. Public opinion would build pressure on Republican members toward an impeachment vote that had even stronger bipartisan credibility.

That did not come even close to happening. To begin with, not only was the vote to begin proceedings not bipartisan, there was bipartisan opposition to it. Polling initially looked promising for impeachment, with media outlets attempting to claim significant bipartisan support for inquiry and removal, but then the polling moved in the wrong direction for Democrats.

Emerson polling showed that support for impeachment flipped since October from 48 percent support with 44 percent opposing to now 45 percent opposed and 43 percent in support. Among key independents, the switch was even more pronounced. In October, 48 percent supported impeaching President Donald Trump, with 39 percent opposed. Now, 49 percent of independents oppose impeachment, while only 34 percent support it.

A new Marquette University Law School poll found that 40 percent of registered voters in the swing state of Wisconsin think that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 53 percent do not think so. Another 6 percent weren’t sure.

A new Gallup poll shows that Trump’s approval has ticked up two points since the impeachment drama began, with 50 percent of Americans opposed to it and 48 percent in support. Henry Olsen notes that Gallup polls all adults, not just registered voters, meaning that a poll of registered voters would have Trump’s job approval even higher and impeachment opposed by closer to a 52-46 margin.

And not only are no Republicans expected to join with Democrats in an eventual impeachment vote, some members expect the bipartisan consensus against it to grow.

Republicans, by contrast, needed to aim for bipartisan opposition to the impeachment proceedings, keep their members in line, make the case that the impeachment proceedings lacked fairness, and that concern about Ukrainian corruption was legitimate. They managed to do all that.

Here’s why things went well for Republicans in phase one of impeachment.

It was completely unclear what crime, much less what high crime, Trump was accused of committing.

Before we get to the politics and how they were played by Republicans and Democrats, it should be noted that President Donald Trump has not been credibly accused of committing any crime, much less a high crime or misdemeanor. It’s almost shocking that Trump, of all people, keeps managing to do well on this score. Yet, as with the Russia collusion hoax, in which he was accused of being a traitor to his country, the lack of evidence for the charges against him is his ultimate saving grace.

What the charge is keeps changing, of course. The whistleblower initially suggested a campaign finance violation arising from a call Trump had with the president of Ukraine. That morphed into a quid pro quo for military aid to Ukraine, then extortion, then bribery, then obstruction of justice, then back to a quid pro quo, but this time only a quid pro quo for a White House meeting. The lack of certainty among even Trump’s critics certainly worked in his favor.

There can be no question that President Trump generally dislikes the boatloads of taxpayer cash in the form of foreign aid that is sent to countries, wishes other countries would support their neighbors more, and absolutely disliked Ukraine corruption. Further, we all know Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate Ukraine’s 2016 election meddling and the involvement of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden in well-known corruption of Burisma, the energy concern on which’s board the former VP’s son found himself on in questionable circumstances. We know these things because of Trump’s public statements and the release of his transcripts with Ukraine’s newly elected president.

We also know that Trump’s support of Ukraine increased over the Obama years, including with the provision of Javelin missiles. And precisely no one had any evidence of anything actually illegal happening, even if they wished that Trump loved foreign aid more and didn’t want the investigations he told everyone he wanted. That further made the case against Trump difficult to argue.

The hearings were boring and complicated.

Objectively speaking, they weren’t just boring but soul-crushingly boring. The testimony was lengthy, the discussion was complicated and bureaucratic. The questions weren’t particularly interesting and the answers they elicited weren’t particularly compelling. You can complain all you want about the fact that they were boring, but they were boring.

Media outlets did all they could to bolster Schiff’s show and ran the impeachment hearings non-stop, as if Schiff’s inquiry had a legitimacy it never quite managed to earn on the merits. But instead of viewership increasing over time, it decreased.

Reporters kept deleting their tweets because they were getting facts about the hearings wrong. If reporters who were paid to follow the hearings weren’t able to keep details straight, what hope was there for normal people who have real lives and better things to do than watch hearings all day?

Adam Schiff lacks credibility.

Democrats didn’t want Rep. Jerry Nadler chairing impeachment since he had so completely botched the initial impeachment effort that was the Robert Mueller probe. Any chair worth his salt would have investigated whether star witness Robert Mueller was fit to answer any questions, much less the questions needing careful handling for an impeachment probe given the failure to find treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

Instead, a seemingly confused Mueller destroyed the chance of convincing the country that he had run the probe that bore his name and had morphed into an attempt to nail Trump for vehemently fighting the false charge he was a traitor. A few other mistakes by Nadler meant that Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave Schiff the gavel for the big show.

Schiff had run the Democrats’ efforts in the Russia collusion conspiracy they peddled for several years. During that time, his team leaked like sieves to compliant media outlets such as CNN and falsely claimed for years to have secret knowledge of Trump being a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. With compliant media outlets, again, he tore down Republican members on his committee and their efforts to get at the bottom of the Russia collusion theory.

When it came time for impeachment, he followed the same pattern, leaking to the compliant media selected excerpts of transcripts to paint a false narrative. But this time, it didn’t work nearly so well. For one thing, the complexity that he weaponized so successfully in the Russia hoax didn’t work with the public. The public had been willing to at least consider an elaborate tale of Trump being a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election.

But when it turned out that Schiff, other Democrats, and the media had been completely wrong about their elaborate theory, it had consequences. They weren’t nearly so willing to fall for the old song and dance a second time, particularly on a story that conveniently began precisely the day after Mueller’s failed testimony.

Even worse for Schiff, he had destroyed the goodwill and comity that had once existed on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. While the compliant media were willing to spoon up whatever he gave them, Republican members knew not to trust him at all. They had also learned from the Russia collusion hoax that they had spent years painstakingly evaluating. Their report outlining Russian meddling as well as a report on some of the concerning behavior of government officials investigating the Trump campaign holds up infinitely better than the Democrats’ report on the same.

Democrats’ witnesses kept making Trump’s case for him.

While the argument for impeachment was difficult to understand, Democrats’ own witnesses kept making Trump’s case against “the swamp” for him. There is no question that these bureaucrats, sometimes using third-hand information, were deeply opposed to Trump, his policies, and his behavior. Their problem was that they were not elected president. In fact, they weren’t elected anything. Some of them were political appointees — a testament to the awful job Trump has done at finding personnel who can accomplish his policy goals — and other times they were career bureaucrats.

The Resistance has generally had a difficult time with this issue, but the proper way to litigate political differences is not with the 25th Amendment, threats to the Electoral College, leak campaigns, spying operations, or impeachment proceedings, but at the ballot box. At no time did any witness make an effective case for anything other than, at best, a trip to the ballot box.

In part because Schiff and his team seemed confused about what case they were prosecuting, questions to witnesses were almost always leading, but never focused on a particular or consistent goal. Conversely, Republicans kept focused during their questions, always pointing out that the witnesses didn’t actually have first-hand information, or were basing their views on their own conjecture, a shaky basis for impeachment.

In general, Republican members did a surprisingly good job on cross examining witnesses. The Democrats kept rolling out new star witnesses, and some, such as Gordon Sondland and Lt. Col. Alex Vindman had opening statements that were quite strong for Democrats. Their opening statements withered under strong GOP questioning.

GOP members stayed on message about the unfairness of the proceedings.

Schiff kept a tight hand on the wheel, controlling witness lists, controlling their testimony, keeping things secret, selectively leaking, and withholding information. That’s his prerogative, but for impeachment to be considered something other than political theater, the unfairness didn’t work.

The entire proceeding began because of a whistleblower claiming a nefarious phone call took place. Initially, Schiff insisted that this whistleblower testify. Schiff repeatedly demanded that testimony. That all changed the precise moment that it was revealed the whistleblower had communicated with Schiff’s staff, something both the whistleblower and Schiff had been dishonest about.

Republicans hammered Schiff about his self-serving about face, even if the media wanted to pretend it wasn’t a big deal. They also reminded him that they weren’t being allowed to call their own witnesses, ask questions, use transcripts of previous depositions, and other things that a fair proceeding would allow. It worked to their benefit.

The initial phase of impeachment being done prior to a vote being held, and in manipulated secrecy did not help Schiff’s case.

The media generally overpromised and underachieved.

The lack of daylight between Democrats and many in the media was difficult to ignore. They seemed to march in lockstep with the day’s messaging from Schiff, as well as the overall legitimacy of the proceedings.

Here, too, the media seemed to underestimate the significant toll their participation in the Russia hoax had on their credibility. Where the public previously may have been willing to trust them when they claimed they had done their homework before claiming some evidence of wrongdoing by Trump, that trust no longer exists.

Each day, Schiff’s team would leak out the messaging for the day along with the prepared testimony of the morning witness. “Wow,” the corporate media would all say in unison as they repeated the message.

The problem is that none of their bombshells exploded, as the Washington Post’s Marc Thiessen noted. The supposed “bombshells” rarely made sense, were frequently contradictory, were never based on first-hand information, and mostly just supported the claim that many bureaucrats wish they ran foreign policy instead of the president.

The general wackiness of the Resistance.

When Republicans mounted an effective case against the impeachment, NeverTrump zealots reacted in a crazed fashion. Some of them became enraged when Rep. Elise Stefanik, a young Republican member, effectively showed weaknesses in witness testimony.

George Conway called her trash and distributed a fake photograph of her supposedly behaving in boorish fashion. Nicolle Wallace, a woman who undermined the McCain-Palin campaign on which she ostensibly served before going to MSNBC, lashed out at Stefanik as “pathetic” and compared her negatively to Nikki Haley. Former Ted Cruz aide Amanda Carpenter called the fake photo “believable” and derided Stefanik as “obnoxious.”

By the end of the hearings, the media were falling back into their most dramatic Russia collusion theories, long since debunked. GQ writer Julia Ioffe, who has had a rough couple of years, saw a Russian plot in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette’s story about Hunter Biden being the father to an Arkansas child.

Impeachment will occur, but on the weakest possible grounds.

Impeachment has been all but a foregone conclusion since the moment Trump shocked the ruling classes with his 2016 victory. The Washington Post announced within minutes of his inauguration that the “campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.”

The Mueller probe was supposed to be the vehicle to accomplish this goal and it would have been if it had been able to come up with anything in favor of its dramatic tale of treasonous collusion to steal the election. Democrats responded to that defeat not by coming up with a stronger case, but a dramatically weaker one.

Still, if media reports are to be believed, it will proceed apace before heading to the Senate where Republicans will control the inquiry on much more favorable ground for Trump. There, they may drag things out to showcase questions about the Biden family’s enrichment during the previous administration, general corruption with countries that have powerful and connected American board members, and other witnesses that Schiff forbade.

They will presumably call the whistleblower to testify about who leaked information to him and which members of Schiff’s committee he worked with before filing his claim. They will almost certainly call Schiff himself to testify about his team’s role in helping the whistleblower set things in motion.

While many in corporate media will attempt to pretend otherwise, the first phase of impeachment did not go well for Democrats. It needed to be their strongest phase. It needed to be a time when support for the inquiry and impeachment grew. Instead, it shrank. Partly that’s due to Democrats’ failed strategy.

But GOP members also played a significant role. They stood strong against both the media and Democrats, showed very little weakness, sent signals early on that they weren’t going to sit back and cower during the proceedings, and generally learned a great deal from the previous few years’ efforts to undo the 2016 election.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/22/how-republicans-won-phase-one-of-impeachment/,2019-11-22
How The Media’s Impeachment Push Harms Democrats,"Right up through the end of Rep. Adam Schiff’s (D-Calif.) impeachment hearings, the media were impeachment’s most enthusiastic supporters. While they’ve been convinced of the need to impeach President Donald Trump for several years now, the hearings convinced them even more of the urgent need to do so.

The media weren’t entirely clear on exactly what grounds he should be impeached, a problem shared by Schiff and his team, but that didn’t dint their enthusiasm one bit.

Instead of making the case that Trump had committed some sort of high crime or misdemeanor meriting immediate removal, they instead just asserted that an unspecified crime had occurred and that witnesses had testified unambiguously that it had occurred. People who actually suffered through the hearings might be forgiven for not having the same impression.

Sure, viewers saw a bunch of hand-selected bureaucrats assert that Bad Orange Man wanted Ukraine to investigate various things, but we already knew that from Trump’s release of the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president and his many public statements on the matter. The question was never about whether Trump wanted these investigations, or even whether one involved the Bidens, but whether it was criminal, much less impeachable, to want these things from a country that receives hundreds of millions of dollars in American taxpayer funds each year.

Trump’s well known efforts were so anodyne and frankly ineffective that — despite the media’s promises of bombshells after bombshells — the best evidence there was for him wanting these things were his own public statements, and not any of the testimony from third- or fourth-hand witnesses.

Having lost the argument, the media switched to asserting that the case had already been successfully argued by the Democrats. A pitch-perfect example of assertion over argument was the Washington Post headline “Trump’s GOP support hardens despite damning impeachment testimony.”

In Philip Rucker’s opinionated writeup of the week’s events, he asserted — without evidence — that witnesses “implicated the president in a scheme to pressure Ukraine to influence the 2020 election.” He appeared to be recasting efforts to investigate Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and the involvement of Biden family members in Ukrainian corruption, as a “scheme” focused on 2020. Rucker appeared oblivious to the fact that last week’s impeachment hysteria appeared to be a scheme by the media and Democrats to influence the 2020 election, as he puts it.

Supposedly objective reporters and the NeverTrump pundits that are overrepresented at all the networks tweeted out their frustration and rage that even the squishiest of squishy Republicans was not falling for the impeachment effort, which, again, they asserted was conclusive.

They knew that for impeachment to have even a fig leaf of legitimacy, it needed strong bipartisan support. In fact, given the establishment Republican participation in the anti-Trump Resistance, it needed even more than the usual bipartisan support. Instead, it had no Republican support. What’s more, the opposition was bipartisan, and giving every indication it might grow.

Media Pumping Brakes

After the high of their impeachment hearings wore off, it appeared that the media realized that their approach wasn’t quite working. Vanity Fair did a polling analysis with truly devastating results for the media and Democrats.

Independents say that the impeachment issue is ‘more important to politicians than it is to me’ (62% to 22%) and ‘more important to the media than it is to me’ (61% to 23%). It is hard to read this as anything but a warning to the Democratic leadership and candidates: Stop talking about issues that matter to you, not to me. Impeachment proceedings are viewed as bread and circuses for the anti-Trump crowd in Washington and the media—or, as Stanford political science professor Morris Fiorina described it to me, ‘entertainment and confirmation.’ That’s a dangerous perception as Democrats approach one of the most consequential and fraught elections of our times.

It’s dangerous for Democrats, but a stunning indictment of the media.

It is impossible to overstate how much the media marched in lockstep together in their view that Trump’s criminality was obvious and proven. Nearly every headline and every article read as if they were written by Schiff himself, instead of an objective look at the witnesses, the evidence, the fairness of the proceedings, or any of the issues that were in the minds of non-Resistance voters.

The complete rejection of this narrative by those outside their shared political milieu is revealing. The corporate media simply don’t have the power that they once did to control the narrative and control political outcomes.

By Sunday, many in corporate media appeared to realize they’d overstepped. The Sunday shows were all more reticent. Media figures haven’t given up impeachment totally, and still speak as if a Senate trial is more of a foregone conclusion than it likely is, but their rhetoric was neutered from the almost hyper-manic zeal of previous weeks.

It appears that the media have moved into a pause stage, perhaps in preparation for a new impeachment push on more favorable grounds in December. Schiff seemed aware of his failure, not just with his angry closing statement on Thursday, but with the news that he may have to call new witnesses.

Media Use of Polling

While I’m not a huge fan of the overuse of polls, it is clear that polls drive much of the media narrative. Nearly every media outlet put out polls suggesting that impeachment was far more popular than it seemed to be in reality. These polls helped push Speaker of the House Nancy Pelois to open a more formal impeachment process, which she’d been trying to avoid on the grounds it would be politically devastating to the moderates who had secured Democratic control of the House in 2018.

So isn’t it interesting that after the enormous amount of news last week, there are so few polls? Why would the media decide not to do polls after their biggest week of news in a year? Now, maybe they’ll release them here soon, but doesn’t it appear like they made a decision to not poll?

To be clear, the norms of polling are that if media outlets do polls, they are supposed to release them. If results are what they like, they release them quickly. If the results are not what they like for their narratives, they downplay them and quietly release them. So it is possible that they did some polling and are working on their release. But it’s safe to say that if the polling results were bad for Trump and Republicans, we’d know about them.

The lack of polling — or their delayed release, if they did in fact occur — are not a good sign for Democrats or the media.

The Media Are Hurting Democrats Via Taranto Principle

The Wall Street Journal’s brilliant James Taranto is responsible for the “Taranto Principle,” which is described as “the press’s failure to hold left-wingers accountable for bad behavior merely encourages the left’s bad behavior to the point that its candidates are repellent to ordinary Americans.”

That is the best possible version of what the media did to Democrats in recent months. At best, they failed to hold Democrats and other Resistance members accountable for their impeachment fantasies.

The Robert Mueller probe was supposed to be the impeachment vehicle until it exploded under questioning of Mueller. He was the lone Republican on the probe, and picked to give it a protective legitimacy while it was actually run by bureaucratic operatives with far worse reputations. But his testimony revealed someone with limited knowledge of the probe and its claims, a devastating problem considering the failure of the special counsel to find any evidence of any American colluding with Russia to steal the 2016 election, much less anyone close to Trump having done so.

When the Russia hoax imploded, the media didn’t hold Democrats accountable for perpetrating it because they had joined forces with Democrats to perpetrate it.

And when the Ukraine impeachment effort began in the immediate aftermath of the Russia collusion hoax, the media couldn’t ask tough questions of Democrats because they needed the impeachment as much, if not more, than Democrats did. The alternative was to admit their failures over the last several years, and that wasn’t going to happen. Until and unless Trump is impeached and defeated in 2020, they will not be able to be honest about their failures.

So the media presented a map of where Democrats wanted to be instead of where they actually were and where they were actually going. The end result was that they led their Democratic colleagues dangerously close to a cliff. Democrats should think seriously about whether their allies in the media are truly serving their interests or are putting them in increasingly difficult situations.

Deep down, Democrats seem to understand “Collusion 2: Ukraine Boogaloo” isn’t selling all that well at the box office. Thus many are shifting back to the Mueller probe, of all things, as the real basis for impeachment against Trump.

What they don’t seem to understand, though, is that their never-ending impeachment mania isn’t failing because they haven’t stumbled upon the right combination of magical words to cast a spell on Americans to get them to support overturning the 2016 election. Their main problem, and one they seem completely incapable of realizing, is that their entire approach is what’s being rejected.

Americans will go to the polls less than a year from now and decide for themselves whether Trump deserves to stay in office. Voters understand that it’s their job to make that decision, not the job of Trump-deranged politicians and media personalities whose Trump obsession has led them to push for his removal rather than the things that people actually care about, like a strong economy, border security, and lowering health-care costs.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/26/how-the-medias-impeachment-push-harms-democrats/,2019-11-26
NYT Columnist Demands Pompeo Defy Trump Or Be Condemned To Hell,"In 42-plus years of analyzing lawyers’ briefs, I have gained some experience in spotting written advocacy that resorts to a variety of mechanisms to camouflage a weak argument. Sometimes authors use personal attacks and inflammatory but baseless accusations to cover up the weakness of their argument.

So it is with political journalists and advocates (an overlapping set, to be sure). Tom Friedman, The New York Times’ resident “intellectual” foreign affairs columnist, demonstrates this technique in spades in his recent unhinged personal attack on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for not publicly disagreeing with President Trump’s decision to recall Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovich.

Friedman’s charge is that Pompeo’s failure to voice his public disagreement with Trump’s decision shows that even though Pompeo finished No. 1 in his class at West Point — a composite of academic, leadership, and physical fitness rankings — “he must have flunked all his courses on ethics and leadership.” Friedman lards up his baseless argument with inflammatory, red-meat personal attacks that can fairly be described as sophomoric, in the sense that they are more typical of something written by an inexperienced but passionate youth, rather than a serious man.

Thus, Friedman’s analysis is that Pompeo is “cowardly” and “slimy,” he must have “failed or skipped” all West Point’s classes on ethics and leadership, and his failure to behave as Friedman would demand is “one of the most shameful things I have ever seen in 40 years of covering U.S. diplomacy.” He has “the mark of Cain on his forehead” and it “will not wash off.” Continuing his biblical references, Friedman assures us it is really a “simple” matter: Pompeo will “lose his soul.”

Well, what on Earth is the basis for damning Pompeo’s soul to hell? It is this, in Friedman’s words:

Though he reportedly argued privately to the president to keep Yovanovitch in place, Pompeo faithfully executed Trump’s order without uttering a word to defend his ambassador’s reputation in public.

In the Friedman world, a Cabinet officer’s faithful execution of a president’s policies after private disagreement is both “cowardly” and “slimy,” not to mention cause for eternal damnation.

Surely Pompeo must have skipped all his ethics and leadership classes, as Friedman asserts, to put himself in such a pickle. But what would Pompeo have learned in all those classes? The Army Field Manual on Leadership (known as FM 6-22) provides guidance. In its discussion of “Responsible Subordinates,” it concludes an example about a team chief’s disagreement with his superior with this admonition:

Ultimately, the discussion must conclude and the chief has to accept his superior’s final decision whatever it may be. From that point on, he is obligated to support that decision and execute it to the highest of standards. Just imagine what chaos would engulf an organization if subordinates chose freely which orders to obey and which to ignore. In the end, it is important for all leaders to preserve trust and confidence in the chain of command and the collective abilities of the organization.

That is precisely what Pompeo did, at least according to the Times’ leading “intellectual.” He had a private discussion with Trump about Yovanovich, disagreed in private, and accepted his superior’s final decision. He then supported that decision. But, like many a person who has been fired or demoted, this hurt the ambassador’s feelings:

Daniel Goldman: So just like that, you had to leave Ukraine as soon as possible?

Yovanovich: Yes.

Goldman: How did that make you feel?

Yovanovich: Terrible honestly. After 33 years of service to our country it was terrible. It’s not the way I wanted my career to end.

By all means then, let us impeach!

Despite the risk of hurting the ambassador’s feelings, the secretary of state’s duty, consistent with West Point’s leadership principles, was to execute the commander-in-chief’s orders and fully support them as if they were his own. Any lukewarm enforcement or public distancing of himself from the president’s decision would be a prescription for chaos.

Finally, Friedman’s overwrought attempts at military analogies are weak tea indeed. Replacing ambassadors who have lost the president’s confidence is in no way comparable to leaving your wounded on the battlefield, as Friedman asserts.

As for his triple-emphasized caution about Trump — “I would never, ever, ever want to be in a trench with that man” — Friedman does not make clear how much time he has spent under fire or in a trench. I think, however, I am safe in concluding that Friedman’s chances of spending time under fire in a trench with anyone are about the same as my chances of serving on The New York Times editorial board with Friedman.

Biden's Burisma Payout Was Far Above Comparable Board Compensation,"Raking in $50,000 a month by serving on the board of a major energy company despite no prior experience in the industry sounds absurd on its face, but when compared to the level of board compensation of other large corporations, it’s almost unimaginable.

A Federalist analysis of board members’ earnings of comparable corporations reveals just how much Hunter Biden was being showered with excess compensation for serving on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father Joe Biden served as vice president dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

According to Bloomberg, Hunter Biden brought at least $50,000 a month for his position on the board of Burisma from 2014 to 2019 without any experience in energy, bringing the former vice president’s son about $600,000 a year and dwarfing the compensation of board members serving on corporations of comparable size.

A 2018 survey from FW Cook, a well-regarded executive compensation consulting firm, shows that of the companies in the S&P 500, large-cap companies, which are companies with a market value of more than $10 billion, paid individual board members a median of $275,000 a year. Among S&P 500 companies in the energy industry, board members were compensated with a median $213,000 a year, with those in the 75th percentile of the salary range still only bringing in $289,000, less than half of what Hunter Biden has been reported earning at Burisma.

Last week, Mark Hemingway of RealClearInvestigations reported on a study from Watchdog Research revealing that Hunter Biden was paid 12 times the amount expected at a similarly sized company, whose board members are typically paid about $55,000 to $83,000 for an entire year.

Burisma, according to Reuters, had a revenue of $400 million last year. In comparison, ExxonMobil reported earnings of $20.8 billion.

Looking at director compensation on ExxonMobil’s board of directors provides an even better perspective on Biden’s pay from Burisma. According to a 2018 proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), the average level of compensation for Exxon’s board of directors in 2017 was almost $365,000. The median compensation was nearly $337,000. Only one of the company’s members of the board made more than $350,000 in total benefits, which was Susan K. Avery, who brought in approximately $767,000 for her work on the board.

While more than Biden’s pay from Burisma, Avery boasts an impressive resume with extensive knowledge in the field. Her experience, according to the report, includes membership on scientific and research advisory committees of NASA, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, the National Park System, the Climate Change Science Program, the Center for Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research, the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology.

Media’s Latest Anti-Nunes Smear Is Cohen-In-Prague All Over Again,"Devin Nunes’ opponents in the Resistance seem to be spiraling.

Their latest effort against the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is to accuse him, without evidence, of secretly meeting in Vienna with a former Ukrainian official “to get dirt on Biden.” The official is former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who former Vice President Joe Biden famously bragged about getting fired in exchange for $1 billion in loan guarantees from American taxpayers.

Incidentally, if there is one thing we have learned from the media in the last couple of months, “get dirt” is their code for Republicans doing investigations. “Investigate” is their code for Democrats trying to get dirt on political opponents. It appears the same term could be used regardless of the political views of those doing the investigations.

In any case, the Resistance theory goes that because of this unverified story, they should get dirt on Nunes should be investigated and removed from his role in impeachment proceedings. It is just coincidence, surely, that Nunes has so effectively neutered the Democrats’ impeachment push by pointing out the flaws with Rep. Adam Schiff’s leadership of the proceedings. It is also coincidence that Nunes is chiefly responsible for blowing up the previous impeachment push through his oversight of the agencies that pushed the Russia collusion theory against President Trump.

It should be noted that the story about Nunes is not just objectively stupid but also extremely likely to be false. For one thing, Nunes denied the claims. “These demonstrably false and scandalous stories published by The Daily Beast and CNN are the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth,” he said.

Shokin has also denied it repeatedly, even claiming through an associate to not even know who Nunes is. The denials are hidden in news stories, such as this one, which puts in a throwaway line deep in the piece. Ukrainian American Lev Parnas, the only source used by CNN and other Resistance Media outlets to make their claims, is extremely compromised.

Parnas appears to be attempting to get in front of Schiff in exchange for immunity, after being charged with campaign finance violations. And he’s not even the actual source. The claim appears to be that Shokin told Parnas of the secret Vienna meeting and that Parnas then told his lawyer who is now telling media figures.

There has not been a single shred of evidence supporting the claim that Nunes was in Vienna. And even Schiff, who spent years falsely claiming to a compliant media that he had evidence of President Donald Trump’s collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election, is strangely quiet about this Nunes claim. Probably that’s because he knows it is false, since he would have knowledge of Nunes’ travel history.

The stupidity and likely falseness of the story has been no barrier for media outlets, who have run dozens of stories about the matter. Here are several ways that this story shows how the media are repeating their past failures on the Russia collusion hoax.

Remember Michael Cohen Goes to Prague?

For years the media were convinced of one of the key claims in the since-debunked “dossier” that the Hillary Clinton campaign had compiled against Trump. That claim was that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had brokered the collusion at a secret meeting in Prague.

As late as December 2018, McClatchy reporters Greg Gordon and Peter Stone claimed there was evidence that Cohen and his phone were in Prague. While they conceded that the Robert Mueller special counsel denied that Cohen was ever in Prague, they laughably refused to pull their two stories on the matter on the grounds that the report “is silent” on whether the phone was there.

“Devin Nunes secretly went to Vienna to collude!” is hardly even a re-write from the false “Michael Cohen went to Prague to collude!” stories that nearly every media outlet ran wild with, to their shame.

Source Credibility Should Matter

Speaking of Cohen, the media should really give some thought to source credibility. When Cohen turned on Trump, media outlets went from not believing his stories to running them without an ounce of skepticism.

In July 2018, CNN’s Jim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein, and Marshall Cohen — two of whom were responsible for one of the key Russia collusion hoax stories that got people hysterical back in early 2017 — reported that “Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN. Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.”

The story claimed two sources, one of whom admitted to lying. That was Lanny Davis, the Clinton operative turned attorney for Cohen. Cohen was presumably the second source.

The reason for the lie can be hinted at in the lede — an attempt to curry favor with Mueller. This is very similar to Parnas working with his attorney to claim something false about others in exchange for help with his legal troubles.

It’s a perfectly fine legal strategy, but media should be a touch more skeptical about participating in it. Or, as one political wag put it:

Parnas was arrested with prescription antidepressants & opioids. The sole source for CNN’s “Devin Goes to Vienna” lie is a drug-addled, indicted sleazeball desperately hoping that Schiff can get him an immunity deal. He can’t. Hope CNN has good lawyers. https://t.co/9rHtXkGsQR — Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) November 26, 2019

Fusion GPS, Is That You?

Nunes noted that the same political operative peddled the stories to “at least five different media outlets before finding someone irresponsible enough to publish them.” The Cohen in Prague story was peddled by Fusion GPS. That was the group the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee secretly hired to concoct the Christopher Steele dossier against Trump.

Peddling stories to multiple media outlets is the Fusion GPS operating style, and they have admitted to doing so against Nunes in the past. In a new book attempting to defend their work, they note that they served as a reporter clearing house during the 2016 campaign. And they do work on active court cases, having previously worked for Russian interests on the Prevezon case, and multiple other litigation issues.

Lazy media outlets love the group because they provide ready-packaged stories, typically against shared political opponents, but their history of getting things so very wrong should mean that media outlets that care even remotely about accuracy stop using them.

Made-Up Stories about Nunes Are a Cottage Industry

In the three years that I have covered the Russia-Trump collusion story, the attacks by the media on Nunes have been a constant. It is true he made the media look extremely foolish with his dogged oversight of intelligence agencies that spied on the Trump campaign, and his skepticism of the collusion conspiracy theory that gripped Washington, D.C. No one likes to be made to look foolish, so the revenge has been an onslaught of false stories about him and his investigative work.

The stories use anonymous sources with axes to grind to make false claims. For example, anonymous Democratic staffers on Schiff’s committee were used as sources for the false claim that Nunes made a “midnight run” to the White House to uncover rampant unmasking by Obama officials. Nunes corrected the false reporting on live national television, but the false story persists.

“Fusion” Natasha Bertrand, whose work in support of the Russia collusion conspiracy theory is legendary, was used to paint a Nunes trip to London as a nefarious adventure to undermine Steele, the author of the false dossier. The only problem with the story was that it was not true at all:

‘While in London, Chairman Nunes did not discuss Christopher Steele in any meetings, he did not try to schedule any meetings to discuss Steele, and he did not seek out or request any information whatsoever related to Steele,’ Jack Langer wrote to me in an email Friday. ‘It’s amazing how an utterly false story based on anonymous sources is uncritically re-reported by dozens of media outlets. Readers can determine for themselves whether these outlets are gullible or simply partisan mouthpieces for the Democrats—and those two things are not mutually exclusive.’

Fusion Natasha’s false claims were reiterated in a book by none other than Fusion GPS co-founders (what a coincidence!), so they had to be denied again.

For some reason, fake news reporters are enamored with the concept of Nunes flying abroad to have some nefarious meeting. They’re often just variants of the ridiculous ‘Michael Cohen went to Prague’ story.’ In this case, Nunes did not try to schedule any meetings to discuss Steele, and he didn’t mention Steele in any meetings. The trip had nothing to do with Steele. But two totally anonymous people claimed otherwise, and that’s all the media needs to assert it as fact, so long as these unknown people are saying what the reporters want to hear.

And now Vienna, in which on-the-record denials from Langer or Nunes himself are not sufficient to stop reporting based on questionable or anonymous sources with zero supporting evidence.

So What?

Again, the Resistance claim seems to be that Nunes met with Shokin, so he must be investigated and sidelined from his effective defense against their impeachment efforts. The story is almost certainly untrue, but even if it were, who in the world cares?

Shokin was famously fired via a pressure campaign from Joe Biden, so he is no longer a prosecutor in Ukraine. That means that no one meeting with him could pressure him to investigate Ukraine corruption or Ukraine election meddling in 2016.

It is reminiscent of stories about Trump looking into the Trump Tower Moscow project, which were painted as nefarious evidence of treasonous collusion with Vlad Putin and not, as seemed more reasonable, evidence that Trump was a global businessman.

Media figures should stop being so utterly deranged and stupid about Nunes. They should follow basic journalistic standards, stop repeating false claims, and stop regurgitating dubious information from compromised sources.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/27/medias-latest-anti-nunes-smear-is-michael-cohen-in-prague-all-over-again/,2019-11-27
Democrat Witness: Evidence Of Crime Not Needed To Impeach Trump,"One of the Democrats’ witnesses slated to testify before the House on Wednesday as part of the latest partisan impeachment proceedings argued more than two years ago that President Donald Trump could be impeached even without evidence of a crime.

Harvard Law School Professor Noah Feldman, who claims to specialize in constitutional studies, told The New Yorker in an article published in May 2017 that Congress could vote to impeach the president without evidence justifying a “high crime and misdemeanor” constitutionally required for presidential impeachment and removal.

The New Yorker article says:

Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor who specializes in constitutional studies, argues that, even without evidence of an indictable crime, the Administration’s pattern of seemingly trivial uses of public office for private gain ‘can add up to an impeachable offense.’

Feldman is set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to kick off phase two of the latest campaign to undo the results of the 2016 election.

Feldman will appear alongside Pamela Karlan from Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina Law School, and Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School to offer their legal opinions to the House Intelligence Committee on whether Trump committed an impeachable offense.

The latest conspiracy theory Democrats have come up with to oust the Republican president features Trump allegedly conspiring with the Ukrainian president to investigate political opponents at home in exchange for U.S. military aid. The charges have centered on a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, an unredacted transcript of which has been declassified and released to the public.

The transcript reveals no quid pro quo, and instead reveals an American president urging the Ukrainian leader to weed out corruption in its government, includes potential corruption related to the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, and to investigate the roots of Ukraine’s involvement in peddling the grand Russian collusion hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States.

Nevertheless, Democrats have rushed forward with impeachment proceedings based on the call, first with secret hearings held in the basement of the Capitol followed by the two weeks of public hearings that did nothing but exonerate the president.

In turn, public support for impeachment has not risen as Democrats had hoped, but plummeted, dashing hopes of galvanizing enough voters to apply pressure on Republican senators to vote to remove the president from office as a consequence of unsubstantiated claims.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/03/democrat-witness-evidence-of-crime-not-needed-to-impeach-trump/,2019-12-03
5 Assumptions That Lead To Junk Conclusions In Impeachment Report,"House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff has released a 300-page Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry report. It’s what you would expect of a rushed report after two weeks of hearsay and opinion testimony: full of unsupported conclusions based upon faulty assumptions.

Garbage assumptions lead to garbage conclusions. Below is a list of several key assumptions Schiff totally failed to support in the report.

1. If You Believe Ukraine Interfered in the 2016 Election, You Must Believe Russia Didn’t

Schiff wrote, “The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations … into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election.” Schiff presented no evidence supporting the assumption that believing Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election requires one to believe Russia didn’t.

Schiff attributed this finding to the intelligence community, writing, “[T]he U.S. Intelligence Community had unanimously determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election to help the candidacy of Donald Trump.” When did the intelligence community unanimously conclude that Ukraine didn’t interfere in the 2016 election? Schiff provides no evidence for that claim because it simply is not true.

2. Ukraine Election Interference Is a ‘Discredited’ Theory

Schiff wrote, “Witnesses unanimously testified that President Trump’s claims about former Vice President Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election have been discredited.” Of course, these witnesses generally lacked firsthand knowledge (or claimed to) and couldn’t really confirm or refute the allegations. Schiff simply declared the Ukrainian interference theory to be “discredited” without addressing any specific evidence of that.

Actually, several operations to support Hillary Clinton in 2016 originated in Ukraine. According to New York Times reporting, a Ukraine court ruled that Ukrainian prosecutors illegally leaked “that a pro-Russian political party had earmarked payments for Mr. Manafort from an illegal slush fund. Mr. Manafort resigned from the campaign a week later.” Politico reported:

Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found. A Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia.

3. Trump Pursued an Investigation into a ‘Discredited’ Claim About the Bidens

Schiff wrote, “The allegations about Vice President Biden were without evidence.” He later wrote, “In so doing, President Trump gave currency to a baseless allegation that Vice President Biden wanted to remove the corrupt prosecutor because he was investigating Burisma, a company on whose board the Vice President’s son sat at the time.”

Actually, Schiff’s own witnesses conceded that Joe Biden’s involvement in the firing of the Burisma prosecutor caused concern, even the appearance of impropriety. Schiff does nothing to examine or dispel the suspicions regarding the Bidens and simply asks readers to accept his declaration that any suspicions about the Bidens’ behavior have been “discredited” and are “without evidence.”

Investigative reporter John Solomon prepared a thorough examination of the timeline and supporting evidentiary documents that indeed indicate corrupt behavior by the Bidens. His article links to several original documents that support his conclusion.

4. Trump Wanted to Investigate Ukraine’s 2016 Election Interference to Help Him Win 2020

Schiff wrote, “President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.” Schiff never explained how an investigation into Ukraine’s meddling in the 2016 election would help Trump’s 2020 campaign.

There’s no indication that any of the Democratic candidates had anything to do with the 2016 presidential elections. Proving Ukraine interfered in the election would not in any way help Trump win in 2020.

5. The Only Reason Trump Wanted to investigate the Bidens Was to Help Him Win Reelection — Which Is Impeachable

All first-term presidents use their powers to get reelected. That’s how presidents remain accountable to voters. But Trump was elected on the general grievance that elite Washingtonians seem to occupy an upper tier in a two-tier system of justice. The chant “lock her up” wasn’t about punishing Hillary Clinton specifically so much as it was directed at elites that seem immune from the same laws under which we, their subjects, must labor.

Schiff wrote, “[S]everal witnesses testified that a request to a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen ‘for political reasons’ goes ‘against everything’ the United States sought to promote in eastern Europe, specifically the rule of law.”

Of course, swamp-dwelling, privileged elites would express shock and dismay that their political allies might be subject to international investigations. But to Trump voters who have seen so many elites slip justice — Hillary Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew McCabe, and now Biden, to name a few examples — the president is doing exactly what he promised to do by asking about the Biden-Burisma protection scheme.

When leftists seek to justify their relentless lawfare assault upon the duly elected president, they tell us over and over again that “nobody is above the law.” It reminds one of “Animal Farm,” in which the ruling elites amended a similar phrase, “All animals are created equal,” to add the phrase, “But some animals are more equal than others.”

And there it is. Schiff’s entire impeachment effort is a defense of the impunity of elite establishment types, such as Biden. Merely asking a foreign country about the Bidens’ side hustle is the crime for which Schiff is attempting to take down Trump.

It’s interesting that the word “bribe” or “bribery” appears five times in the report — but never to describe the president’s behavior. In fact, Schiff failed to tie the president’s alleged “misconduct” to any specific criminal statute. How can he? Swamp privilege may be real, but Schiff doesn’t yet have the guts to put it in writing.

Ironically, one of the first reforms Ukraine implemented to fight corruption was to repeal elite privileged immunity. America is in dire need of a similar reform here.

Biden Fat Shames Iowa Voter Who Says Hunter’s Ukraine Work Is Disqualifying,"During a town hall in Iowa on Thursday, 2020 Democratic hopeful and Former Vice President Joe Biden took a jab at a voter’s weight. The voter expressed concerns over Biden’s age and his son’s controversial relationships in Ukraine. Biden snapped back in a critical and confrontational manner.

“We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine… but, you on the other hand, sent your son over there. He not only worked for a gas company, but he had no experience in … You’re selling access to the President just like [Trump] is,” said the Iowa man.

“You’re a damn liar man,” Biden responded.

“I saw it on the TV,” the voter said.

“You see it on TV? No, I know you do. By the way, that’s why I’m not sedentary, I get up,” Biden said.

Biden proceeded to challenge the man to a push-up competition.

“Let’s run; Let’s do whatever you want to do,” Biden said.

A whole lot going on in this video, including Biden appearing to make multiple veiled jabs at the Iowa voter's weight https://t.co/T087FFgoMf — Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) December 5, 2019

Toward the end of their spat, Biden addressed the man saying, “Look, fat…” Audience members gasped and look at each other.

Biden told the Iowa voters that, “No one has said my son did anything wrong.”

In fact, reports that show Hunter Biden received compensation for his work at a Ukrainian oil company that far exceeds what a regular board member makes. Another report found emails which revealed the oil company’s consulting firm leveraged Hunter Biden to get a meeting with the U.S. State Department. This all took place while Biden was the Vice President of the United States.

Hunter has denied any wrong doing, but admitted to “poor judgment” in taking a paid position in a Ukrainian gas company.

Despite the mainstream media pushing the idea that problems with Ukraine started and ended with Donald Trump, the narrative is clearly not resonating with middle Americans. Iowa voters are concerned about Biden fostering a corrupt work environment during his time as Vice President. Based on the information out there, they are completely justified in their speculation.

Biden should be prepared to answer questions over reports about his son. Next time, in a polite and non-confrontational way if he hopes to win over the voters he desperately needs to clinch the 2020 nomination.

Impeachment Is Damaging Democrats' Political Hopes For 2020,"Democratic efforts to impeach President Donald Trump were supposed to help them politically in 2020. In moments of unguarded honesty, a few Democrats admitted as much publicly, saying the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet.

.@RepAlGreen: “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected. … We must impeach him.” pic.twitter.com/3cwG7eFIdy — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) May 5, 2019

It’s a great example of how this particular impeachment push keeps backfiring on Democrats. They claim, without evidence, that Trump was trying to get Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election by asking for their cooperation in investigating Ukrainian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. And they claim that this is such a dire threat that Trump must be removed from office and disqualified from running in 2020. Yet their own impeachment effort is about retaliation for 2016 and the hope that they can politically damage Trump heading into the 2020 election.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she would like articles of impeachment drafted, a foregone conclusion ever since Democrats won the House in 2018. Some members, such as Rep. Al Green pictured above had joined the media in calling for Trump’s impeachment since before he was even inaugurated. The precise reasons keep changing (earlier this year, nearly 100 Democrats voted to impeach Trump for the high crime of criticizing Democratic lawmakers Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on Twitter), but the fervor to retaliate against Trump for beating Hillary Clinton 2016 remains unchanged.

The theory behind the 2020 impeachment push is that Trump will be so damaged by the relentless onslaught of negative discussion about him that it will make voters elect someone else. And who knows? That might happen.

In practice, however, this particular impeachment push is becoming something of a worst-case political scenario for Democrats.

It’s Not Popular And It’s Not Becoming More Popular

With much water carrying by the media, the current impeachment effort got as much help as imaginable when it was kicked off by Democrats in September. Several media outlets claimed a majority of Americans were completely on board with the plan to oust Trump and overturn the 2016 elections. With that generous media treatment of the topic, Pelosi was encouraged to get things going, even though she had previously cautioned against a purely partisan impeachment process. Not only have no Republicans fallen for the impeachment push, some Democrats joined Republicans in opposing it. Support for Pelosi’s investigation gambit was purely partisan, while its opposition was bipartisan.

After Rep. Adam Schiff’s hearings, which were widely if unenthusiastically watched, support for impeachment went down and opposition to impeachment went up. That was particularly true for the valued independent voters, the majority of whom oppose impeachment.

Democrats needed to start with a strong bipartisan push and then peel off Republican voters and members over the course of the inquiry, but that is not happening. And given the trajectory of polls over the last month, it’s only going to get worse for Democrats on that score, not better.

It’s Soul-Crushingly Boring

Critics of the Clinton impeachment used to claim he was being impeached for sexual indiscretion. The actual charges were for perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his actions in response to a sexual harassment lawsuit he was fighting. But at least they were tangentially related to sex! This made his impeachment far more interesting than one in which Democrats seem to be flailing about in search of an actual crime.

There has been no big reveal other than Trump releasing his own transcripts that were supposedly so egregious. People could read them for themselves and either yawn or feign outrage or have some other reaction. But the hearings have been soul-crushingly boring. Bureaucrats and law professors gave overly long opening statements, after which point grandstanding members of Congress from each party either asked condescending questions about the Bad Orange Man or pointed out inadequacies in the testimony of the witnesses (the vast majority of whom didn’t actually witness anything). After weeks of media-fueled hype about how the walls were finally closing in on Trump, the hearings amounted to little more than whining from collection of disgruntled bureaucrats outraged that Trump refused to let them, rather than the nation’s elected leaders, direct American foreign policy.

It Couldn’t Be More Partisan

While a few Democrats joined with Republicans in opposing impeachment, support comes only from Democrats. Democratic leaders previously said that impeachments that weren’t bipartisan were illegitimate by definition.

But they don’t appear to be even trying to make this impeachment seem legitimate.

Pelosi had Schiff handle the heavy lifting of impeachment because she did not trust Rep. Jerry Nadler to do it, even though he chairs the committee that has proper jurisdiction. Nadler’s hearing yesterday gave an indication of why she worried about him playing too prominent a role. His witness list was a perfect example of how he bungles up processes. Of his three witnesses, one was an Elizabeth Warren donor who previously said she couldn’t stand to walk on the same sidewalk as the Trump hotel. Another witness previously said Democrats didn’t even need evidence of crimes committed by the president in order to impeach him. And their third and final witness previously helped run Dianne Feinstein’s anti-Brett Kavanaugh smear operation in 2018. This is not who you show to the world to demonstrate your independence and even-handedness.

Democrats Aren’t Fulfilling Their Election Promises

A previous Democratic impeachment effort against Trump was going more or less going according to plan until the news in March that Robert Mueller had found no evidence of any Americans treasonously colluding with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, much less anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign, much less Trump himself.

After years of a campaign by Democratic operatives in the government and media to push a conspiracy theory of treasonous collusion with Russia, it could not have ended more poorly. Robert Mueller, the absentee figurehead of the investigation into Russia collusion, had a Democratic team of attorneys who attempted to redeem the special counsel probe by putting together an elaborate claim that Trump had obstructed justice by denying his guilt of a crime the investigators themselves found no evidence was ever committed.

Impeaching for this “obstruction” theory after the failure of the Russia collusion hoax was always going to be difficult, but Robert Mueller caused grievous harm to the effort when he testified before Nadler’s committee in July and revealed that he had little knowledge of the investigation he was purported to be leading. Criticism of the probe had been disallowed by the media on the grounds that Mueller was beyond reproach, even if his team was politically radical. That protective barrier they put on the probe evaporated, and with it evaporated hopes of beginning obstruction-focused impeachment proceedings in July.

Nadler had previously revealed in November of 2018 that impeachment was a foregone conclusion but that the precise details were being worked out. The Democrats’ leaders assumed it would be related to Russia and the Mueller probe.

Between the Mueller impeachment push and the Ukraine impeachment push, though, Democrats have done absolutely nothing other than try to overturn the 2016 elections. Elections are less than a year away and this impeachment push is crowding out their ability to get the things done that they promised voters they would do if they were entrusted with the House of Representatives. All the promises to fix a health care system obliterated by Obamacare, pass sweeping gun control laws, and repeal Trump’s tax cuts were all thrown by the wayside so Democrats could focus on impeachment instead.

Pelosi had hoped to have an extremely quick impeachment that would slake the Democratic party’s anti-Trump bloodlust while still leaving time for legislative accomplishment and fulfillment of campaign promises. Instead, it’s dragging on and failing to catch fire, meaning that Pelosi’s committee chairmen are having to go back to the Russia well in search of impeachable material against Trump. It’s reminiscent of the gambler at the casino who responds to heavy losses by doubling down on his bets in the hope he can make back his money. It would be much wiser for him to cut his losses and leave the casino before making things worse, but for some reason he just can’t put down the dice. Democrats would be much better off in the long-run if they ended the charade now, perhaps opting for a quick censure over a full-blown impeachment vote, and moved on to passing bills they promised their voters they would pass.

Now Democrats might not be able to vote until after Christmas or potentially even next year, precisely the long and drawn out scenario they had hoped to avoid.

Trump is clearly vulnerable heading into 2020, and Democrats have a real shot of beating him, retaining control of the House, and perhaps even winning control of the Senate. Impeachment is making that task much harder by showing the American public that Democratic lawmakers’ primary concern isn’t creating jobs or raising wages or lowering health care costs for Americans, it’s sticking it to Trump, no matter the cost.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/05/impeachment-is-slowly-destroying-democrats-2020-political-hopes/,2019-12-05
Why Devin Nunes’s Phone Logs Aren’t A Smoking Gun,"On Tuesday, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., filed suit against CNN for defamation after the airport staple ran a hit piece that falsely reported that the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor in Vienna last December to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. Both Nunes and his supposed Ukrainian contact, former Prosecutor General Victor Shokin, immediately countered the charge. In his lawsuit, Nunes punctuated the denial by detailing where he had been during the time period in question.

“Between November 30, 2018 and December 3, 2018, Devin Nunes visited Benghazi, Libya on official business of the House Intelligence Committee to discuss security issues with General Khalifa Haftar. Devin Nunes also traveled to Malta, where he met with U.S. and Maltese officials, including Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, and participated in a repatriation ceremony for the remains of an American World War II Soldier missing in action,” the complaint read. Nunes also never met Shokin, as CNN reported, he stressed in his lawsuit.

CNN’s source for its story was Joseph Bondy, the lawyer for the Russian-born American Lev Parnas, the latter of whom is currently under indictment for federal election crimes. In addition to telling CNN that “Parnas was told directly by the former Ukrainian official that he met last year in Vienna with Rep. Devin Nunes,” Bondy also told CNN that Parnas “and Nunes began communicating around the time of the Vienna trip.”

“Parnas says he worked to put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians who could help Nunes dig up dirt on Biden and Democrats in Ukraine,” CNN reported Bondy as relaying. Not so, according to Nunes’ lawsuit: He “never communicated with Parnas in December 2018 at the time of the ‘Vienna trip’ (that also never happened),” the complaint stated.

That CNN had peddled yet another fake news story garnered little attention, however, because the same day Nunes filed suit, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the intelligence committee, dropped his 300-page report on the House’s “impeachment inquiry.” Thus attention quickly focused on the listing of Nunes in a telephone log showing calls between the California congressman and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as four April 12, 2019 calls between Parnas’s cell phone and Nunes’s number.

Nunes recalls speaking with Giuliani, telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity that they had laughed about Robert Mueller’s special counsel probe and how it “completely bombed and flamed out.” Nunes said he didn’t recall speaking with Parnas, though.

The press and the left nonetheless portrayed the phone log as a smoking gun proving Nunes was complicit—of something. However, the real complicity lies between the press and Democrats on the Hill.

Had CNN not run the fake story in late November tying Nunes to Giuliani, Parnas, and Ukraine, and invented a plot between the group to dig up dirt on Biden, the telephone contacts would mean nothing. After all, the calls all occurred in mid-April, before Ukrainians elected Volodymyr Zelensky president on April 21, 2019, and months before Trump supposedly threatened to withhold aid to the country.

Nunes agrees, telling The Federalist, “CNN’s false Vienna story set the stage for Schiff’s stunt with my phone records. There is a constant symbiosis between the Democrats, particularly Schiff, and the mainstream media. They’re always on the same page, working toward the same goals.”

The end goal, of course, is impeachment, but to get there Democrats hope to first sideline Nunes—something they tried before when the left first began pushing the Russia collusion hoax. But while then-Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., benched Nunes temporarily from leading the Russian election interference probe based on unfounded ethics charges, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has Nunes’s back, telling reporters, “there’s nothing wrong that Devin has done except once again to get accused of something.”

And that something was clearly orchestrated, with CNN initiating the narrative based on recklessly sourced allegations against Nunes, which, even when proven demonstrably false, left a lingering impression that the ranking Republican had somehow been complicit in the alleged misconduct related to Ukraine. But the problem for Democrats is that their case for complicity is just as weak as their case for misconduct.

13 Things To Look For In The Inspector General FISA Abuse Report,"Today, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz will reportedly issue his findings on the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI’s compliance (or lack thereof) with the legal requirements and internal policies and procedures related to the Carter Page Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications. Horowitz’s report follows a 20-month investigation into possible FISA abuse, as well as an inquiry into the DOJ and FBI’s relationship and communications with dossier author Christopher Steele, triggered by requests from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and members of Congress.

Horowitz’s investigation was limited in scope and thus will leave unanswered many of the questions surrounding the FBI’s targeting of the Trump campaign in the spring and summer of 2016—concerns hopefully addressed soon by Attorney General William Barr and the federal prosecutor he assigned to investigate those matters, Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham. But, given the breadth of the already released details indicating substantial abuse of the FISA process, the IG’s report should address a plethora of problems, some identified by then-House Intelligence Committee chairman, Devin Nunes, and many more discovered as additional facts became known while the Russia collusion hoax unraveled over the last two years.

1. Concerns about Federal Surveillance of Carter Page

Before looking at a list of concerns Horowitz’s forthcoming report should address, here are the basics concerning the Page FISA warrants. According to the response memo Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) released to counter Nunes’ memo, the “DOJ first applied to the [FISA court] on October 21, 2016 for a warrant to permit the FBI to initiate electronic surveillance and physical search of Page for 90 days, . . .The Court approved three renewals—in early January 2017, early April 2017, and late June 2017—which authorized the FBI to maintain surveillance on Page until late September 2017.”

We also know from “Nunes’ HPSCI memo that former FBI director James Comey certified three of the FISA applications and former deputy director Andrew McCabe certified the fourth, while former deputy attorney general Sally Yates approved the initial October 21, 2016, application and the January 2017 renewal, and then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signed the June 2017 and September 2017 renewals.”

Horowitz should have addressed the initial question of whether, before the DOJ sought and obtained the first FISA surveillance order in October 2016 for Page, federal prosecutors filed an earlier FISA application the FISA court denied. If so, the question quickly turns to: What changed?

Then, the foremost question the IG’s report should address concerns the DOJ’s basis for believing that probable cause supported the Page FISA applications. Because Page is a U.S. citizen, to obtain a surveillance order under FISA, “the DOJ needed to establish probable cause that Page was ‘an agent of a foreign power’ and was engaged in ‘activities [that] involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States.’” And “probable cause needed to exist for the initial October 21, 2016 warrant and for each subsequent renewal.”

2. What Criminal Allegations Existed Against Page?

While the DOJ has released redacted versions of the four FISA applications, the specific criminal statutes Page’s activities purportedly violated have not yet been revealed. The IG should both identify the crimes the FISA applications relied upon and address whether the FISA applications established probable cause.

This analysis will be key because everything known to date indicates the DOJ’s FISA applications failed to present evidence sufficient to establish probable cause that Page violated U.S. criminal law. The only apparent evidence suggesting criminal activity by Page came from the Steele dossier, wherein the former MI6 spy claimed “that during a July 2016 trip to Russia, Page attended a secret meeting with the head of the Russian-owned oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a ‘US-sanctioned individual.’” Steele, relying on an unnamed source, further stated that Sechin “offered PAGE/TRUMP’s associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatised) stake in Rosneft in return [for the lifting of sanctions].”

But as I have previously explained, “this ‘evidence’ could not possibly support a finding of probable cause because courts require independent police corroboration for information provided by sources of unknown reliability,” and Steele’s sub-sources were of unknown reliability. Also, “[t]he FISA application ‘appears to contain no information corroborating the dossier allegations against Mr. Page.”

Further, former FBI Deputy Director “Andrew McCabe acknowledged that without the dossier the FBI could not have claimed probable cause for the surveillance.” Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley’s (R-Iowa) criminal referral of Steele also confirmed that “the bulk of the [FISA] application consists of allegations against Page that were disclosed to the FBI by Mr. Steele and are also outlined in the Steele dossier.” Under these circumstances, any analysis of the DOJ and FBI’s handling of the FISA applications should necessarily address the question of probable cause and what appears to be the utter lack of evidence that Page was engaged in criminal activity.

3. Did the FBI Follow the Woods Procedures?

A second core area of the IG’s report should address the so-called Woods procedures. The Woods procedures, named after FBI agent Michael Woods, “were instituted in April 2001 to ‘ensure accuracy with regard to … the facts supporting probable cause” after recurring instances, presumably inadvertent, in which the FBI had presented inaccurate information to the FISA court.’” Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa explained the procedures last year at JustSecurity.org, which The Hill later summarized:

The completed FISA application requires approval through the FBI chain of command ‘including a Supervisor, the Chief Division Counsel (the highest lawyer within that FBI field office), and finally, the Special Agent in Charge of the field office, before making its way to FBI Headquarters to get approval by (at least) the Unit-level Supervisor there.’ At FBI headquarters, an ‘action memorandum’ is prepared with additional facts culled by analytical personnel assigned to espionage allegations involving certain foreign powers. Next, it goes to the Justice Department ‘where attorneys from the National Security Division comb through the application to verify all the assertions made in it,’ wrote Rangappa. ‘DOJ verifies the accuracy of every fact stated in the application. If anything looks unsubstantiated, the application is sent back to the FBI to provide additional evidentiary support – this game of bureaucratic chutes and ladders continues until DOJ is satisfied that the facts in the FISA application can both be corroborated and meet the legal standards for the court. After getting sign-off from a senior DOJ official (finally!).’

Did the DOJ and FBI follow these procedures in the case of the four Page FISA applications?

Each application was labeled “VERIFIED APPLICATION” and states that “[t]he FBI has reviewed this verified application for accuracy in accordance with its April 5, 2001 procedures, which include sending a copy of the draft to the appropriate field office(s).” Yet the FISA applications relied on the unverified Steele dossier and included references to Yahoo! News and other reporting the FBI did not vet.

For instance, to build the case that Page was a Russian agent, the FISA applications referenced “a July 2016 article in an identified news organization” that claimed Trump’s campaign worked behind the scenes to ensure the Republican National Committee’s platform did not pledge weapons to Ukraine. That article, of course, was the debunked Washington Post piece that falsely claimed the Trump campaign had gutted the RNC’s anti-Russian stance on Ukraine.

The FISA applications then relied on an August 2016 article which reported that Trump might recognize Crimea as Russian territory, suggesting the Republican candidate’s more conciliatory approach to Russia followed Trump’s “recent association with several people sympathetic to Russian influence in Ukraine, including foreign policy advisor Carter Page.”

The “facts” reported in these newspaper articles were never vetted by the FBI, so why did the DOJ include those details in the FISA applications? Why was such information included in the FISA applications? Who made the decision to include it? And what other evidence was not vetted and verified? Horowitz’s report should address these questions.

4. Why Did Page’s Application Not Follow the Usual Path?

The IG’s report should also discuss the approval process and any issues with it, and specifically why the “linear path” FISA applications typically take did not occur in the Page case, as former FBI Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson made clear during her testimony in August 2018 to the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.

During her testimony, “Anderson explained that she was normally responsible for signing off on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before they reached the desk of her superiors for approval. Anderson said the ‘linear path’ those applications typically take was upended in October 2016, with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates signing off on the application before she did. Because of that unusual high-level involvement, she didn’t see the need to ‘second guess’ the FISA application.”

So, while as the senior executive service representative for the FBI’s National Security Law Branch, Anderson would normally be the “approver” for the “initiation” of the Page FISA, including determining whether there is legal sufficiency, in this case, Anderson testified “[t]he General Counsel [Jim Baker] … personally reviewed and made edits to the FISA,” and “Deputy Director [McCabe] was involved in reviewing the FISA line by line. The Deputy Attorney General [Yates] over on the DOJ side of the street was similarly involved, as I understood, reviewing the FISA application line by line.”

Thus her approval, Anderson stressed, “was really purely administrative in nature. In other words, the substantive issues — the FISA had already substantively been approved by people much higher than me in the chain of command.” Anderson also indicated that “due to time constraints,” even under normal circumstances, she “would not read the full FISA application before signing off on it ‘unless there were an issue that was identified by the cover note.” Similarly, it was doubtful Comey would read a full FISA application, Anderson indicated, and instead, “if he signs the FISA, you know, relies on others.”

This testimony raised several questions for Horowitz: Was the DOJ and FBI’s normal FISA process consistent with the Woods procedures? What about the handling of the Page applications? Did that process violate the Woods procedures? And did any of the individuals who drafted, reviewed, and approved the FISA applications verify the information included therein?

5. Was Any Application Info False or Misleading?

Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s congressional testimony raised similar concerns. Last year, Rosenstein told the House Judiciary Committee that “the FBI provides the DOJ the completed FISA application and a team of DOJ attorneys then brief Rosenstein on the details.” Does this process comport with the Woods procedures? Even if it does, that means “in approving the FISA application, Rosenstein must rely on the accuracy and honesty of the FBI agents involved, as well as his team of DOJ attorneys who brief him on the content of the application.”

Here, then, we have a third area on which Horowitz’s report should focus: The content of the FISA applications and whether any information included was false or misleading and whether any information omitted should have been included. Relatedly, did the DOJ attorneys who briefed Rosenstein (and Yates) provide a fair and accurate briefing and flag issues which should have been highlighted?

This area of the IG’s report should be massive given the many concerns already identified in congressional testimony and exposed in publicly released documents.

This area of the IG’s report should be massive given the many concerns already identified in congressional testimony and exposed in publicly released documents. For instance, when Rosenstein testified before the House Judiciary Committee, after explaining the process that led to him signing the final Page FISA application, Rosenstein noted that he had “reviewed that one in some detail, and I can tell you the information about that doesn’t match with my understanding of the one that I signed…”

Rosenstein did not elaborate, stating instead that he thought “it’s appropriate to let that Inspector General complete that investigation,” but Rosenstein’s testimony suggests that whomever briefed him did not provide an accurate summary of the FISA application. So, who briefed Rosenstein, and what was he told? And how did that compare to the FISA application Rosenstein signed?

And what about the FISA applications? Who drafted those? When Comey’s replacement, Christopher Wray, testified alongside Rosenstein, he told the House Judiciary Committee that he did not “know who was involved in drafting what FISA application,” but we know that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the Russia investigation and had to have had some role.

But what role, and who else was involved? Horowitz should discuss those questions and the impact of Strzok and Lisa Page’s anti-Trump bias. Also, did other individuals likewise have an anti-Trump bias? And did that bias impact the drafting process and what was—and was not—included in the FISA applications?

6. Hiding the Steele Dossier Commissioners From the Court

A thorough investigation by Horowitz would then require him to analyze the content of the FISA applications and assess whether the information included was false or misleading, starting with what appears to be a purposeful attempt to hide from the FISA court the fact that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funded the Steele dossier. Why hide that fact? Why not simply write, “The U.S.-based law firm that hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research on Candidate #1 did so on behalf of Candidate #1’s opponent, Candidate #2”? Who decided to obfuscate, and why?

7. Why the FBI Lied about Steele’s Press Contacts

Of course, the “identified U.S. person” referred to in the FISA applications is Steele, and much of the IG’s report will need to discuss the FBI’s use of the former MI6 operative and the glaring problems seen in the FISA applications related to Steele.

Grassley highlighted one such problem when he issued a criminal referral for Steele. In the referral, Grassley stated that “[t]he FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016. But Mr. Steele has admitted—publicly before a court of law—that he did have such contacts with the press at this time, and his former business partner Mr. Simpson has confirmed it to the Committee. Thus, the FISA applications are either materially false in claiming that Mr. Steele said he did not provide dossier information to the press prior to October 2016, or Mr. Steele made materially false statements to the FBI.”

Since Grassley issued his criminal referral, further evidence has come to light suggesting that the FBI falsely informed the FISA court that Steele did not have contact with the press prior to October 2016. Specifically, in notes from a meeting between Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec and Steele on October 11, 2016—two weeks before the DOJ and FBI relied on the Steele dossier to obtain a FISA surveillance order targeting Carter Page—Kavalec wrote that in “June—reporting started” and the “NYT and WP have,” indicating both The New York Times and The Washington Post had Steele’s research. Kavalec also added that Steele said he was “managing” four priorities—“Client needs, FBI, WashPo/NYT, source protection.”

Kavalec’s notes of her conversation with Steele contradict the FISA application’s assertion that Steele did not have unauthorized contacts with the press prior to October 2016. The IG’s report should address this discrepancy and why the FISA application contained this apparently false information.

8. Other Information Questioning Steele’s Reliability

The FISA applications also maintained that the FBI had determined Steele to be “reliable” and was “unaware of any derogatory information pertaining” to their source, but Kavalec’s memorandum showed that Steele was not reliable. In her meeting notes, Kavalec wrote that Steele claimed “the Russians had constructed a ‘technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election’ that recruited emigres in the United States to ‘do hacking and recruiting,’” and that “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.” But Kavalec’s notes corrected Steele’s “intel,” by stressing: “It is important to note that there is no Russian consulate in Miami.”

What other evidence did the FBI have calling into question Steele’s reliability? Had the British government warned the FBI? Had agents begun to vet the dossier and discovered flaws in his supposed intel?

And what about Steele’s bias? In her notes, Kavalec documented Steele’s statement that his client was “keen” that his anti-Trump research be made public before Election Day. And Steele had previously told DOJ lawyer Bruce Ohr that he was desperate that Trump not win the 2016 election. But the FISA applications were silent on Steele’s anti-Trump bias. The IG’s report should address these questions and omissions.

9. The Bruce Ohr Problems

Now to Bruce Ohr. Ohr was a longtime acquaintance of Steele’s, and in 2016 an associate deputy attorney general. Ohr and his wife, Nellie Ohr, had breakfast with Steele at a D.C. hotel the day before the FBI launched Crossfire Hurricane, its investigation into the Trump campaign.

Bruce Ohr would later take on a much more significant role when, after the FBI terminated Steele as a source on November 1, 2016, Ohr became a conduit to keep feeding Steele’s intel to the FBI, which Ohr did on at least 12 occasions, continuing until November 2017. Yet in the FISA applications, the DOJ represented to the FISA court that Steele had been terminated as an informant.

This arrangement raises a lot of question for Horowitz. Did the FBI violate its policies and procedures by using an intermediary to receive “intel” from a terminated source? Who arranged for Ohr to act as a go-between, and why? Who knew of the arrangement? Rosenstein says he did not, but did other higher-ups?

Did the FBI provide Rosenstein information laundered through Ohr without Rosenstein’s knowledge? And did any of the “intel” originating from Steele find its way into the FISA applications that stated Steele had been terminated as a source? Specifically, did Steele provide Ohr a copy of his Dec. 13, 2016 memo that comprised the final two pages of what is commonly called the Steele dossier, and was that information incorporated into the FISA application?

Ohr also met with Steele’s business partner, Glenn Simpson, in December 2016. Did Ohr pass any dirt gleaned from Simpson onto the FBI? Did the later FISA applications include any of that information? The IG’s report should addresses these questions and concerns.

10. Then There’s Nellie Ohr

IG Horowitz’s report should also explain whether the FBI and DOJ acted properly with regard to Nellie Ohr. Bruce’s wife, Nellie worked for Fusion GPS, the firm that had hired Steele to cull opposition research on Trump. During his congressional testimony, Bruce revealed that after the FBI launched an investigation into the Trump campaign, Nellie gave him a flash drive containing the Trump-Russia research she had compiled for Fusion GPS. Bruce then passed Nellie’s opposition-funded research to the FBI.

Nellie’s research, which she detailed in congressional testimony, mirrors some of the information contained in the FISA applications, raising the question of whether the FBI used Nellie’s opposition research to obtain a court order to surveil Page. If so, was this disclosed in the FISA applications?

11. What the FBI Withheld about Page’s Help Prosecuting Spies

Then there is the FISA applications’ attempt to portray Page as culpable because he had been targeted by a Russian intelligence officer for recruitment. It appears that the DOJ withheld some material facts from the FISA court concerning those past efforts, however; namely the Russian intelligence officer who had attempted to recruit Page was later convicted of espionage-related charges in federal court and Page had assisted the government in its prosecution of the Russian spy.

The IG report should note whether the DOJ provided the FISA court information concerning Page’s past cooperative efforts related to the Russian intelligence officers, and if not, why not. And who made the decision not to explain Page’s prior cooperation to the FISA court?

12. The Real Origin of Crossfire Hurricane

It also appears likely that the DOJ misled the FISA court on the timing and reason the FBI launched operation Crossfire Hurricane, another concern the IG should address. While the FBI officially launched Crossfire Hurricane on July 31, 2016, we now know that the FBI began investigating the Trump campaign before then.

The FISA application also appears to falsely portray Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos as connected to Russia’s hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails and WikiLeaks’ July 2016 release of those emails. But Papadopoulos had no connection to Russia’s hacking.

“In fact, in September 2016, before the first FISA surveillance order, the individual since revealed as an FBI informant (Halper) reportedly attempted to get Papadopoulos to confirm he knew about the Russia hacking, by saying to the Trump foreign policy advisor: ‘George, you know about hacking the emails from Russia, right?’ Papadopoulos told Halper he didn’t know anything about emails or Russian hacking.”

So, not only was there no evidence Papadopoulos or others in the Trump campaign were involved in, or knew of, the Russian hacking before the general populace did, there was evidence negating such knowledge. Did the DOJ inform the FISA court of these facts? Horowitz’s report should address these questions.

13. What Role Did Joseph Mifsud Play?

Also apparently absent from the FISA applications are details concerning Joseph Mifsud, who becomes relevant because, in an attempt to bolster the Russia collusion narrative, the FISA applications reference the FBI’s launch of a counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016, based on Mifsud’s supposed statement to Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on Hillary.

Did the FISA applications portray Mifsud as a Russian agent? Was that an accurate portrayal? And what did Mifsud tell the FBI in early-to-mid February 2017, when agents questioned him in Washington DC? Did the FISA application inform the court of Mifsud’s statements? If not, why not? Horowitz should have an answer.

These are merely the questions begging for answers from the already publicly available information, but Horowitz had access to substantially more details and his investigation should have uncovered even more facts. Horowitz’s report should summarize the results of his investigation to make clear that he followed the leads where they led.

One investigative trail of particular importance is the communications accessed and intercepted pursuant to the FISA applications. Did the FBI access communications between Page and Trump campaign members? If so, what communications, involving what players?

If Horowitz conducted a fair and thorough investigation, he should have the answers to these questions—and so should we soon.

"No, The GOP Is Not Arguing Process Instead Of Facts On Impeachment","In their pre-hearing coverage of yesterday’s impeachment testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, the CNN pundit panel that contained no pro-Trump voices made some predictions. Again and again we were told, as we have been for weeks, that we should expect Democrats to argue the facts and Republicans to argue against the process, presumably because they cannot argue the facts.

Over the next several hours in statements and under questioning, GOP counsel Stephen Castor talked about almost every aspect of the factual record of impeachment. In fact, he addressed a much wider set of facts than the cherry-picked ones addressed by his Democrat counterpart, Daniel Goldman.

Castor addressed the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, myriad meetings, and the reasons aid to Ukraine may have been delayed and why it may have been eventually released. He addressed claims made by various officials who testified. So, clearly after this exhaustive discussion of the facts from the Republican side, the CNN panel after it (which did have one Trump supporter) would have to admit that this occurred, that contra their predictions the facts were extensively dealt with.

Of course, that did not happen. Commentator Gloria Borger, who has been repeating this absurdity for weeks, was joined by several others who just flat-out lied about the facts being dealt with. This is a persistent myth going back at least to October, when The Atlantic ran an article titled “Why Republicans Are Complaining About the Impeachment Process” which argued, “There’s a reason Republicans have been making a great fuss about the process of the impeachment inquiry over the past few days. Unwilling, or more likely unable, to mount any substantive defenses of President Donald Trump’s behavior with regard to Ukraine, members have instead assailed the way Democrats are conducting the inquiry.”

It wasn’t true then and it most certainly is not true now. If it were true, there would have been at least one instance from yesterday’s hearing in which Castor refused to engage on a factual question asked by a Democrat. That never, ever happened. Yet this talking point, which is a huge bag of nonsense, persists.

Have Republicans argued against the impeachment process as well as the facts? You bet they have. This sham inquiry has at various times denied the White House participation, denied potential witnesses administration attorneys, denied House Republicans the right to call their own witnesses, and held secret depositions that Democrats selectively leaked.

But the suggestion that these are the only arguments Republicans are making, which might at one point have been an honest mistake, is now a blatant and outright lie.

Meanwhile, here some facts that Democrats refuse to discuss or bring witnesses in to testify to. Why did a Ukrainian gas company under investigation hire an unqualified Hunter Biden? Why didn’t then Vice President Joe Biden recuse himself on Ukraine when his office found out about this potential conflict of interest? Why were Ukrainian officials writing opinion articles in newspapers against Donald Trump? If this is the party of facts, don’t we need to talk about these facts?

“Republicans won’t talk about the facts” is a talking point that needs to die a swift death. It was William F. Buckley who said, “Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views.” That’s exactly what is going on here. Republicans have been talking about the facts all along. Democrats and their allies just don’t like where those facts have been leading.

That is because the facts lead to the conclusion that Trump was acting within his legitimate authority regarding every allegation made against him. It was legitimate to ask for European allies to give more aid to Ukraine, it was legitimate to ask for investigations into corruption (even if it happens to hurt Joe Biden), and it was legitimate to delay the military aid, something experts testified is a common occurrence.

The entire Democratic demand for impeachment has now boiled down to a myopic and un-provable assertion that Trump’s sole interest in Ukraine was digging up dirt on Joe Biden. In order to make this assertion, they must ignore an entire universe of facts and conditions that prove their theory laughable. Republicans know this, and while they have reasonable arguments against the impeachment process as well, their main focus remains that the facts do not show what the Democrats want them to, no matter how many times liberal TV pundits say they do.

Schiff: Only Impeachment Will Ensure A Free And Fair Election,"Democratic Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff of California argued Tuesday that only the extraordinary measure of impeachment would ensure a free and fair election next year.

Announcing formal articles of impeachment alongside Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Schiff also repeated the debunked claim that Trump cheated in the first election, despite a two-year special counsel investigation with unlimited resources finding otherwise.

“The argument ‘why don’t you just wait?’ amounts to this. Why don’t you just let him cheat in one more election? Why not let him cheat just one more time? Why not let him have foreign help just one more time?” Schiff questioned. “The president’s misconduct goes to the heart of whether we can conduct a free and fair election in 2020.”

In other words, the only election Democrats will accept the results of is an election without Donald Trump. Impeachment and conviction not only removes the president from office, but it disqualifies the removed individual from even seeking that office again. Democrats are therefore trying to ban Trump from ever holding power in the White House again.

While Democrats often questioned whether Trump would respect the results of the election throughout 2016, Democrats have yet to accept the election results themselves three years later and have been attempting to impeach Trump since day one of the Trump presidency. The Washington Post even ran a headline just minutes after Trump took the presidential oath reading, “The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.”

The partisan impeachment efforts have been the Democrats’ latest, and closest attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election after several other attempts have already failed, including the collapse of the grand Russian collusion conspiracy, which, as evidenced by Schiff’s press conference, many Democrats still believe.

This week’s articles of impeachment introduced by Democrats follow several weeks of hearings focusing on the question of whether this time, Trump conspired with a foreign leader to interfere in the next U.S. presidential election. The allegations center on a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where Trump allegedly demanded his Ukraine counterpart to launch an investigation into the Biden family in exchange for approximately $400 million in military aid.

An unredacted transcript of the July phone call was declassified and released to the public prior to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s opening of a House investigation revealing no such quid pro quo. Instead, the transcript illustrates an American president condemning corruption in Ukraine, urging the Ukrainian president to combat the problem and investigate the origins of the European nation’s involvement in peddling the Russian hoax. Pelosi however, plunged the Democrats into impeachment proceedings where Schiff held secret hearings in the basement of the capitol for more than a month pre-interviewing witnesses before a public impeachment investigation was voted on by the full House chamber in a partisan vote on Halloween.

Throughout the public process, Democrats failed to bring to light any hard incriminating evidence against the president, and in fact, Democrats’ own star witnesses offered testimony vindicating the president.

Multiple witnesses called by Democrats said they saw the president engage in no such crime or quid pro quo involving the Ukrainian president.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/10/schiff-only-impeachment-will-ensure-a-free-and-fair-election/,2019-12-10
"Hillary Clinton, Chris Steele Allege Boris Johnson Is A Russian Stooge","Hillary Clinton is back, and so is Chris Steele, this time in the United Kingdom. They are no less than implying that current Conservative (Tory) Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a Russian plant. And it’s no mistake that these allegations are being made just before a U.K. general election on December 12 that will decide the fate of Brexit.

It started last month, when the U.K.’s leftwing Guardian newspaper reported the existence of a secret report that said the Russians spent five years “cultivating leading Tories including Johnson…” The 50-page “dossier” from the U.K.’s intelligence and security committee is “based on analysis from Britain’s intelligence agencies, as well as third-party experts such as the former MI6 officer Cristopher Steele…”

That’s crazy, because Steele is the same man who claimed the Russians had been “cultivating, supporting, and assisting” Trump “for at least five years.” A sprawling, unlimited-spend, two-year U.S. special counsel investigation found that false.

This Guy Can’t Be Trusted

Readers will remember that Steele was hired by Fusion GPS, an opposition-research outfit hired by a law firm called Perkins Coie, to manufacture ties between Trump and Russia. Meanwhile, Perkins Coie was hired by, and working closely with, the Clinton campaign and other Clinton operatives.

Steele paid a British national with ties to Russia—Edward Baumgartner—to create a “dossier” tying Trump to Russia via wild and unsubstantiated claims, which Baumgartner created using unknown Russian sources. Once the dossier was created, Steele and other Clinton operatives, including the infamous Sid Blumenthal, injected the allegations of the dossier into the Obama administration. This included getting the dossier circulated at high levels within the State Department, and within the Department of Justice and FBI.

Eventually, using the dossier, the FBI secretly spied on the Trump campaign. And the Clinton campaign tried to use the FBI’s investigation to smear Trump, which amounted to interference in the 2016 election by the Clinton campaign, using Russians to assist her efforts. Using Steele, the Clinton campaign planted media stories smearing Trump as a Russian agent, then responded to them as if they had appeared organically.

In the U.K., which has stricter libel laws than does America, Steele wouldn’t even back up his dossier in court. Instead, he emphasized that he never wrote it, which is of course true, because Baumgartner and unknown Russians wrote it.

Steele Is Back in the U.K.

Given his dismal track record, it’s stunning that Steele has again surfaced, just before the U.K. election that will decide the fate of Brexit, this time to claim that Johnson is a Russian asset.

Right behind Steele is Hillary Clinton, who is saying to the British press that it is “shameful” the U.K. government won’t publish Steele’s report before the election. She also told the BBC that she’s “dumbfounded” that Johnson’s government could get away with not releasing the report, allegedly damaging to Johnson.

This deserves to be unpacked a bit. First off, it is damning to British intelligence that they would still be working with Steele, given what we know today. And this isn’t the first stain on British intelligence.

In mid-2016, before the U.S. election but after the Brexit vote, FBI number two Andrew McCabe—heavily involved in spying on and launching an investigation into the Trump campaign—met with his British counterpart at MI5, Jeremy Fleming. As the establishmentarians that they are, both Fleming and McCabe were upset by the Brexit vote. Calling the Brexit result they didn’t like a “wake-up call,” they blamed Russian interference for the outcome.

Earlier in 2016, former Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos was set up in London. And serious allegations have emerged that former CIA head John Brennan used GCHQ to spy on the Trump campaign.

GCHQ is Britain’s signals intelligence outfit, akin to the United States’s National Security Agency (NSA). Fleming is now head of GCHQ, which surely played a role in generating the report that says PM Johnson is some sort of Russian plant.

But the rot is probably larger than Fleming. All the way back in late 2015, GCHQ allegedly began to flag U.S. officials about its concerns related to Trump and Russia. Were these concerns generated by Steele? And what were these concerns, beyond foreign policy differences and the fact that Donald Trump was bucking the D.C. foreign policy establishment?

And if Steele started to plant these concerns in late 2015, while Trump was rising in the GOP primaries and before the Democratic National Committee was allegedly hacked by Russian intelligence, what does this say about the origin of the Russia investigation?

Let’s Get Some Perspective

Back to Clinton: in the same interview with British press, she went on to say that Russia was “pumping out propaganda” in the United States in 2016, and implied Russia is now doing the same thing in the United Kingdom.

But a quick overview of the facts tempers this popular fallacy. Russia spent little more than $100,000 on digital ads, compared to $90 million in digital advertising spent by the Trump campaign. While Trump and Clinton spent a combined $81 million on Facebook ads alone, Russia spent only $46,000 on Facebook ads that ran before the election, many of which were not overtly partisan or in swing states.

To highlight how preposterous this is, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Democrats, led by Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), had a grand conspiracy theory that said the Trump campaign helped the Russians spend this $46,000 by telling the Russians which swing states to target, and this would amount to proof of collusion.

Of course, no such coordination was ever discovered. And instead of talking to the Trump campaign, the Russians could have talked to anyone in America to figure out where the swing states and swing districts were. Yet both House and Senate intelligence committees, Republicans included, spent countless hours on the subject of Russians on social media.

Given this record, it’s highly likely that certain forces in the U.K. are now trying to overblow Russian influence there. The U.K. establishment has desperately tried to thwart Brexit despite a democratic vote to the contrary. It’s even possible that allegations of Russian influence will be used once the December 12 election is over (assuming Johnson wins) to try to hamper Johnson’s Brexit efforts, and maybe even bring down his government.

Russia Hysteria Isn’t Dead in America

Blaming Russia for Brexit is only the latest example of a corrupt class blaming Russia for every political outcome they don’t like, and were too myopic to see coming. This Russia hysteria is unfortunately still alive and well in America.

The Washington Post consistently runs articles that label Republicans as Russian “assets,” or “stooges.” The airwaves are also full with these insinuations, and a constant spin that brings us further from the truth. NBC’s Chuck Todd just attacked Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for saying that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, not just Russia, despite clear evidence that Ukraine did meddle in the 2016 election, which the media was reporting on until it didn’t fit their narrative. Several weeks ago, Todd tried to paint Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) as a Putin stooge for saying the same thing.

It’s as if the media wants the American people to forget the last two years happened, but still wants the American people to think there’s something fishy between Trump and Russia.

Around the same time, Fox’s Chris Wallace and CNN’s Chris Cuomo blatantly mischaracterized recent Trump statements on the DNC server to make it sound like the president was saying that Ukraine had hacked the server, not Russia. In reality, all Trump said was that CrowdStrike—a company with a record of overstating its findings—examined the DNC server, not the FBI. The president’s statement was entirely true. Kennedy stood his ground against Wallace, but eventually backed down to Cuomo.

Now that the inspector general’s report is out, there is major pushback in the media against the idea that U.S. intelligence did anything improper when spying on the Trump campaign. It’s as if the media wants the American people to forget the last two years happened, but still wants the American people to think there’s something fishy between Trump and Russia.

The consequence of crying “Russia” is power being taken away from the people and consolidated in the hands of faceless bureaucrats in Washington, for whom wide bipartisan swaths of America neither voted, relate to, nor agree with.

That’s why the “Russia” hysteria will certainly surface again in 2020 and beyond, partly because of the growing disconnect between Washington and the rest of the country. If labeling someone a “Russian asset” gets the national security apparatus behind you, gets your opponent spied on, and counts as an excuse for losing an election, why not keep doing it?

But this is incredibly dangerous, because we’ve seen this rhetoric get weaponized into spying on political opponents, subverting the foreign policy of our elected leaders, and even impeachment. Meanwhile, the integrity of our elections has been brought into question by irresponsible political leaders to a level that may plague the republic for decades to come. Will the selfish establishment ever stop crying “Russia!”?

What Needs to Be Done

Here’s what needs to be done to counteract this plague on the body politic.

The Trump administration, and future conservative presidents, need to examine ways to hold the intelligence agencies more accountable. This probably starts with making it easier to fire federal workers. Federal workers aren’t a protected class, and they don’t deserve to stay at their jobs with automatic pay raises no matter what.

Too many of the GOP establishment-anointed successors to Trump have been all too quiet about the intelligence agency abuses that occurred in 2016 and beyond.

A solution also starts with our political leaders acknowledging there’s a problem at the FBI and CIA. House intelligence committee ranking member Devin Nunes has done this. And President Trump has at least verbally pushed back. But too many of the GOP establishment-anointed successors to Trump have been all too quiet about the intelligence agency abuses that occurred in 2016 and beyond—Nikki Haley comes to mind, as do several Senate Republicans including Marco Rubio. Why are these establishmentarians so against stating the obvious?

Russia spent about $100,000 on online ads, and probably hacked the DNC server, although the FBI never examined that server. But Russia also helped Steele write his dossier, and Russians were involved in setting up Don Jr. in Trump Tower.

Russia interfered, and that’s bad. But weaponizing Russian interference for partisan gain damages America far more than actual Russian interference ever could. Intelligence agencies getting involved in politics and policy—including through selective leaks to the press—also absolutely threatens our democracy.

In general, an obsession over Russian election meddling is unhealthy for American democracy. It causes our political leaders to focus on a boogeyman that happens to fortify the status quo and bureaucratic power, versus examining what voters really care about. And it treats the American people like dupes, which is why it will never work—although it may tear the country apart.

Impeachment Articles Are About Stopping Trump From Winning In 2020,"Finally, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and I agree on something. In announcing the two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, Nadler said: “Our next election is at risk….That is why we must act now.”

That, you see, is why Democrats have been pushing to impeach Trump for as long as he’s been in office: they do not want to take the risk that he might get re-elected.

The first sentence of the first article of impeachment says it all, stating that Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election.” No mention of a quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or a “shake-down,” the phrases Democrats had been trying out in the last few months. They settled on accusing Trump of “abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.”

According to the resolution, the interference that Trump solicited was for Ukraine “to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection.” These were investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, “a political rival,” and a “discredited theory…that Ukraine—rather than Russia—interfered in the 2016 United States Presidential election.” Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into announcing these investigations by making them the condition for receiving security assistance Congress had appropriated and a “head of state meeting at the White House, which the President of Ukraine sought.”

Clarity is vital for something as serious as trying to remove a duly elected president. Presidents solicit actions by other governments and apply various kinds of pressure all the time. In this specific situation, there were legitimate reasons for Trump to urge Ukraine to investigate corruption. By Democrats’ own terms, it is Trump’s alleged motive of seeking “interference in the 2020… election” that turns this from the duties and decisions while in office to the reason for removing him from that office.

When he opened the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearing on Nov. 13, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) stated: “The facts in the present inquiry are not seriously contested.” Well, facts about the delay in security assistance, about Trump’s desire that Ukraine conduct investigations, and some kind of link between the two may not be seriously contested.

But Democrats do not seek to impeach Trump simply for those actions. Rather, they say that Trump took those actions “for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit.” This last part—the “corrupt purposes”—is the key to the whole thing.

An impeachment is fairly compared to an indictment in the criminal justice process. Democrats’ first article of impeachment is the equivalent of an indictment for a specific-intent crime. It’s not enough to prove that a defendant did something, or even that he intended to do it. If a prosecutor charges a specific-intent crime, he must also prove that specific subjective intent. In the impeachment process, that means proving Trump intended his actions to result in Ukraine interfering in next year’s election.

Testifying before the Judiciary Committee earlier this week, Intelligence Committee investigations director Dan Goldman said Trump sought to “coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election.” Saying it, however, does not make it so.

Nor does speculation about what the investigations that Trump sought might have uncovered, or how those results might have been used. Without evidence that Trump intended that result, this remains a hypothetical, in part because Ukraine never conducted those investigations.

Perhaps Trump’s critics believe that he had, as the impeachment resolution states, “corrupt motives” in pushing Ukraine to investigate these matters. Believing it, however, does not prove it. Perhaps that doesn’t concern them. Perhaps, like Nadler, they simply want to affect next year’s election.

The GOP’s Four-Point Defense Of Trump Is Devastating,"During Thursday’s mark up of the articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans unveiled a four-point defense of President Trump that is stunning in its simplicity and blows massive holes in the Democrats allegations of abuse of power. Essentially the Democrats are accusing Trump of shaking down Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky by withholding aid and demanding announcement of investigations, including one involving Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

To this, the central charge in the articles of impeachment, Rep. Jim Jordan and others presented four specific facts. First, both Trump and Zelensky say there was no pressure applied. Second, the transcript does not indicate Trump making any demands or setting any conditions. Third, Ukraine was not aware that the aid was delayed. And fourth, aid flowed without any announcement of investigations. Taken together, these four defenses have more than enough weight to crush the Democrats’ case, but lets look at them one by one.

The fact that Zelensky says on the record that he did not feel pressure from Trump is an important one that has been widely ignored. As Rep. Matt Gaetz argued, there can’t be a shake down if the person being shook down has no idea its happening. Unless Zelensky is lying, the entire case against Trump just disappears.

Democrats on Thursday, as they have before, but more vehemently so, said that of course Zelensky must be lying. He needs American aid so he is lying to stay on the good side of the president. Setting aside the fact that the Democrats making this claim have no evidence to support it, it also undermines the credibility of Zelensky, one of the very things they accuse Trump of doing.

As to the transcript itself, the GOP members honed in on the fact the “favor” in the conversation was not a “a favor for me,” but a “favor for us.” And later the “us” is clarified as “our country.” This also strikes at the core of a case that depends upon the claim that Trump’s only interest in Ukraine policy was getting dirt on Joe Biden to help himself politically.

When Trump says, after asking Zelensky to investigate Ukrainian interference in 2016, “our country has been through a lot.” He means the Mueller probe, and he’s not wrong. How much evidence or information about Russian interference exists in Ukraine is up for debate, but the fact that it is a legitimate subject of interest for the President is not.

One of the few facts in all of this where there is some debate is when exactly Ukraine became aware that the military aid had been delayed. But all versions place it very late in the timeline of events, certainly long after the July 25 phone call with Zelensky. That’s like trying to blackmail someone with scandalous photos of them without letting them know you have any scandalous photos of them. It’s impossible.

The delay of the aid was part of a wider set of concerns regarding how much Ukraine could be trusted with the money. Throughout the late summer and fall, through a set of meetings and phone calls with American officials Zelensky proved to Trump that he could be trusted. That is what Trump wanted to know and why he released the aid without any announcement of investigations.

And that final fact, that the aid was released without the announcements Democrats claim were the condition to release them, really puts the period on the sentence. Democrats claim the aid was only released on September 11 because the White House became aware of the whistleblower report. But this ignores the fact the aid had to release by September 30, and doing so is a two-week process.

So essentially, aid was released on or about the deadline set to release it. That is a much more plausible explanation for the timing than some whistleblower report spooking Trump. Is it possible Trump was angry at yet again being undermined by people in the federal government for exercising his legitimate powers? Sure. But there is no evidence to suggest that Trump was ever planning to ultimately kill the aid.

These four basic points will make up the core of the Republican defense of Trump on abuse of power charges. The White House should be very happy. Unlike the serpentine choose your own adventure story the Democrats have cooked up, this is a straightforward and simple defense, it can be explained quickly and it all makes perfect sense.

Democrats Are Passing The Weakest Impeachment In American History,"Democrats are on the verge of passing the fourth set of articles of impeachment this week through the House Judiciary Committee, putting the House one step closer to officially impeaching President Donald Trump. They include one article for “abuse of power” and one article for “obstruction of Congress.” Judiciary committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said near midnight last night the vote will be held this morning at 10 a.m.

It all marks Democrats’ closest attempt to finally achieve the top item on their policy agenda for the past three years: to reverse the results of the 2016 election. It has been an ongoing effort since day one of the Trump presidency and has been destined for failure from the beginning.

First, it was Russia. Democrats and a complicit media tried for years to convince the American public that Trump was a Russian asset working to undermine the interests of the United States for an adversary. After wall-to-wall media coverage, a deep-state FBI surveillance operation based on junk information funded by the Democratic National Committee, and a two-year special counsel investigation with unlimited resources, no one, none of the Democrats, no one in the media, not even Robert Mueller found one person from the Trump campaign, let alone Trump himself, had colluded with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton.

Since the grand failure of the Russian collusion hoax, Democrats have pushed onward with their attempts to delegitimize the Trump presidency. They’ve advocated for the destruction of the constitutionally created Electoral College, labeling it a “racist” institution. They’ve continued to claim Trump’s victory was a consequence of “fake news.” They’ve claimed Russia “hacked” the election. They’ve rioted across the country chanting “resist” at every opportunity.

The latest attempt now supposely centers on Ukraine. The latest scheme to undo the will of nearly 63 million voters in 2016 relies on yet another conspiracy theory lodged by Democrats offered legitimacy once again by a compliant media, this time alleging Trump conspired with the Ukrainian president to investigate political opponents at home.

The evidence Democrats have relied on, however, makes for the weakest impeachment ever launched in American history, highlighting gross abuse of congressional power and serving as a national embarrassment.

Examining The Evidence

The impeachment proceedings were kicked off by an anonymous whistleblower complaint of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint marked “credible” and “urgent” by the intelligence community inspector general despite no first-hand knowledge of the phone call was rejected by the Department of National Intelligence. An unredacted transcript of the phone call, however, was still declassified and released to the public by the administration, putting the conversation between the two world leaders in plain sight for all to see in an unprecedented move.

Democrats have argued the call reveals a seditious President Trump pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden’s family in exchange for nearly $400 million in military aid that was withheld days before the call.

Upon the transcript’s release, media outlets selectively sliced up the text to fit the false narrative of Ukrainian collusion. The Washington Post and The New York Times glossed over entire portions of the transcript to corroborate misleading headlines connecting “favor” with an investigation of the Biden family. CNN completely omitted 540 words on air to frame the president in an claimed quid pro quo.

A true and honest reading of the transcript however, offered no such evidence. The grand revelation from its release? That the American president urged the leader of one of the world’s most corrupt nations to rid his government of the corruption, and to investigate Ukraine’s peddling of the Russian collusion hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States. That’s the basis for which Democrats are impeaching President Trump for a “high crime and misdemeanor.”

In 1868, President Andrew Johnson, the first president ever to be impeached, clearly violated a congressional statute. A century later, President Richard Nixon clearly did something wrong and resigned before the articles could pass a full vote on the floor of the House. Twenty years ago, President Bill Clinton lied under oath.

Trump’s “high crime?” That he demanded a foreign leader clean up his own government. President Zelensky himself even said he felt no pressure to launch the requested investigations to receive the aid.

Of course, it is up to the House to define what exactly constitutes a “high crime and misdemeanor.” With this loose authority, it’s surprising that it has taken this long for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finally pick something to charge the president, given the 86 bogus reasons Democrats have come up with to impeach. Granted, Democrats placed a big bet on Mueller report solidifying their made-up charges of collusion based on debunked intelligence from the DNC-funded Steele dossier.

The Democrats’ Own Witnesses Exonerated the President

House Democrats still held four weeks of impeachment hearings to make their case to the public — two weeks of hearings in the House Intelligence Committee to interview fact witnesses followed by two weeks of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee to make their legal arguments.

Neither round produced any incriminating evidence to impeach the president of any kind of crime, whether it be a “quid pro quo,” “bribery,” or “extortion,” let alone the conventional standard of a “high crime and misdemeanor” constitutionally required to pursue presidential impeachment. In fact, to the contrary, witnesses called by Democrats either destroyed their own credibility as characters of the deep-state or exonerated the president of any wrongdoing.

Ousted former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich blatantly admitted that Trump committed no crime.

“Do you have any information regarding the president of the United States accepting any bribes?” Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah asked during her hearing.

“No,” Yovanovitch said.

“Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?”

“No.”

Enter Former State Department Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Staffer Tim Morrison whose testimonies both sliced straight through the crux of the Democrats’ impeachment theory. In their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, both affirmed that there was no quid pro quo offered from Trump to Ukraine regarding the withheld military aid, which was ultimately released.

“In no way, shape or form in either readouts from the United States or Ukraine did you receive any indication whatsoever, or anything that resembled a quid pro quo, is that correct?” Republican counsel Stephen Castor asked Volker.

“That’s correct,” Volker said. “I was never involved in anything that I would consider to be bribery at all…or extortion.”

Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California also posed the same question to Volker and Morrison, who were testifying together.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?” asked Nunes.

“No,” said Morrison.

“No,” said Volker.

U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland’s testimony was also supposed to be a bombshell day for Democrats, and mainstream media reported that it was. Sondland indeed testified that he believed there was a quid pro quo offered with Ukraine in exchange for the military aid.

Sondland, however, who had changed his testimony several times since the start of the impeachment process, offered no hard evidence to prove his claim and admitted during his testimony that his conclusion was based entirely on presumptions. Sondland was also asked during the hearing whether anyone told Sondland that the military aid was contingent on any political investigations.

“Mr. Sondland, let’s be clear: no one on this planet—not Donald Trump, Rudy Guiliani, Mick Mulvaney, Mike Pompeo—no one told you aid was tied to political investigations, is that correct?” Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio asked the ambassador.

“That’s correct,” Sondland said.

Sondland further conceded that Trump explicitly told the ambassador that he wanted “no quid pro quo.”

When impeachment proceedings came to the Judiciary Committee, no witnesses offered any new facts to advance the Democrats’ case. Instead, legal experts offered their own opinions on whether what Trump committed was impeachable conduct.

The Biden Problem

Witnesses testifying before the House Intelligence Committee also furthered the case to investigate the Biden family, with every single person to come before the committee agreeing that there was a perceived conflict of interest when Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden was serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while Joe Biden oversaw U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president.

Hunter Biden was raking in $50,000 a month for serving on the board despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of comparable board compensation reveals this sum to be astronomically higher than what Hunter should have been making even with a high level of expertise in the field.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” testified Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. Kent also told lawmakers that in 2015, Kent raised his discomfort over the situation the Obama White House, which brushed off his discontent.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told lawmakers in an October private deposition. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth the deal with family related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

Even Democrats Are Peeling Away From Impeachment

Public polling has shown Americans have not bought into the Democrats’ charade. Even after four weeks of hearings, public support for impeachment has failed to rise as Democrats had hoped, remaining steady at the same levels prior to the public proceedings.

A new Monmouth poll released Wednesday reveals that a majority of voters remain opposed to Trump’s impeachment 50-45 percent, well outside the survey’s +/-3.3 percent margin of error.

NATIONAL POLL: Support for impeaching and removing @realDonaldTrump unmoved by public hearings in House. 45% support (44% in November)

50% oppose (51%)https://t.co/HPGFli9vo1 pic.twitter.com/r3ac3D8kHH — MonmouthPoll (@MonmouthPoll) December 11, 2019

Further, impeachment has become wildly unpopular in key congressional swing districts vital to Democrats hoping to cling to their House majority next fall. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Democrats are now bracing for at least six additional moderates to break from the party on the House floor next week when the articles come for a full vote. Two Democrats already defected from impeachment when the House voted on the formal proceedings late in October.

The only bipartisan vote likely to take place next week is in opposition to the Democrats’ partisan effort to cast aside the will of the voters in 2016.

"Ukrainian Oligarch Paid $700,000 To The Husband Of A House Judiciary Committee Democrat","Robert Powell, the husband of Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla., reportedly took $700,000 from a Ukrainian oligarch named Igor Kolomoisky. Mucarsel-Powell sits on the House Judiciary Committee, the committee that drafted two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump for his alleged abuse of power with regards to Ukraine.

In 2018, the Daily Beast reported that a number of businesses linked to Kolomoisky hired Powell as an attorney. One of those firms paid Powell at least $700,000 over two years, according to public records.

The Miami Herald reported Powell was working for companies tied to Kolomoisky for 10 years. Powell made most of his money in the two years leading up to his wife’s election in 2018.

Kolomoisky has been accused of contract killings and embezzlement in the past. Yet, in 2018 when Mucarsel-Powell was running for her seat, she did not see her husband’s work as relevant to her campaign.

“Debbie Mucrasel-Powell is running for Congress, not her husband. To imply that Debbie has anything to do with her indirect shareholder of a parent company that once employed her husband is an enormous stretch,” said Michael Hernandez, senior communications advisor for her campaign in 2018.

While Mucrasel-Powell may have convinced her constituents that her husband’s work is unrelated, it is a clear conflict in the current impeachment of Trump. Mucarsel-Powell voted to impeach Trump.

Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell just voted to impeach @realDonaldTrump. What got ZERO attention: Her husband took $700K from firms tied to a Ukrainian oligarch under FBI investigation. A total double standard! #FL26 — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) December 13, 2019

The House has moved to impeach Trump over a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When the House initiated impeachment hearings, they were arguing Trump asked for a quid pro quo or potentially bribed the Ukrainian president. No evidence to corroborate those charges has been found, so now the House is charging the president with abuse of power and obstructing Congress in relation to the Ukrainian phone call.

And yet, no Democrats see a problem with one of their own committee members’ spouses doing business with a Ukrainian ogliarch. There has been no check on whether Mucrasel-Powell is benefitting from her husband’s work with a foreign power that interfered in the 2016 election.

There is a double standard in Mucrasel-Powell’s ability to impeach the President for his work in Ukraine, simultaneously, allowing her husband to earn money from Kolomoisky, a thug from the same foreign power.

Democrats Rubber-Stamp Impeachment Through The House,"It’s official. President Donald Trump has officially become the third president to be impeached in the weakest impeachment case ever lodged against a president in American history.

By a nearly party-line vote, House Democrats passed two articles of impeachment against the president, by a vote of 230 to 197 at 8:34 p.m. after a daylong debate. One article for “abuse of power,” and another for “obstruction of Congress.”

Two Democrats voted against the measure. No Republicans voted for it, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii voted present.

House Democrats have now come through on their signature campaign promise at the top of their policy agenda: an attempt to reverse the 2016 election results through impeachment despite a majority of Americans disapproving of the president’s impeachment.

Now a trial is slated to take place in the Republican-controlled Senate in the new year where Trump is almost certain to be acquitted of the charges lobbied against him. The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for the removal of a president through impeachment, requiring 20 of the chamber’s 53 Republicans to join Democrats and oust a president of their own party.

The House voted to kick impeachment over to the Senate following two months of public and private hearings offering no credible evidence to incriminate Trump on the charges lodged against him. To the contrary, multiple witnesses offered testimony exonerating the president of any wrongdoing, admitting that the president committed no crime whatsoever, let alone a “high crime and misdemeanor” to warrant the extreme measure of impeachment.

The proceedings were kicked off in September by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following new details of an anonymous whistleblower filing a complaint alleging Trump invited the Ukraine president to interfere in the next U.S. election. The complaint centers on a July 25th phone call between the two world leaders and was found “credible” and “urgent” by the intelligence community inspector general but was rejected by the Department of National Intelligence.

An unredacted transcript of the phone call was declassified and released to the public following the revelations of the complaint. Democrats and a complicit media argued Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political opponents at home in exchange for nearly $400 million in withheld military aid in an apparent “quid pro quo.”

The transcript however, reveals no such scheme, and instead shows the president urging Zelensky to rid his own government of the corruption plaguing his country, and requesting that the Ukrainian president investigate the origins of its involvement in peddling the damaging and defamatory Russia hoax in the United States. That’s the “high crime and misdemeanor” Democrats have charged the president for “abuse of power.”

House Democrats have also charged the president with “obstruction of Congress” for refusing to cooperate with the unconstitutional proceedings aimed at simply reversing the results of the 2016 election three years later after the epic collapse of the grand Russian collusion conspiracy theory targeting the president.

Next year’s Senate trial has already begun with rampant partisanship where Democrats desperate to turn the tide of public opinion have called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to bring forward new witnesses to testify.

McConnell has rejected the Democratic pleas, arguing it was the House’s job to conduct the investigation.

“It is not the Senate’s job to leap into the breach and search desperately for ways to get to ‘guilty.’ That would hardly be impartial justice,” McConnell said on the floor of the Senate Tuesday.

Senate Republicans are pushing for a quick and speedy trial that will exonerate a president who never should have been impeached in the first place.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/18/democrats-rubber-stamp-impeachment-through-the-house-trial-to-begin-in-senate/,2019-12-18
FBI Blows Off Senators' Request On Materials Related To Ukraine,"The FBI ignored Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin’s requests last month for information related to former Democratic National Committee (DNC) contractor and her efforts to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign from Ukrainian officials.

In November, Johnson and Grassley gave the FBI a Dec. 9 deadline to meet their demands to hand over information found over the course of an investigation into a cyberattack on the DNC.

Politico reported in 2016 that Chalupa met with a government official from the Ukrainian embassy for damaging information on the Trump campaign. Later that year, Yahoo News reported that Chalupa was the target of a cyberattack while she was working at the DNC prompting FBI investigators to question Chalupa and take digital forensic images of her computer and smartphone.

“If this reporting is accurate, it appears that the DOJ and FBI have in their possession material relevant to our Committees’ ongoing investigation into collusive actions Chalupa and the DNC took to use foreign government sources to undermine the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” Grassley and Johnson wrote to Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

According to a Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Grassley’s office, the FBI has yet to respond to the senators’ demands for interview notes and the materials related to Chalupa’s devices.

The senators’ requests to the FBI came in the midst of House impeachment proceedings centering on President Donald Trump and his dealings with Ukraine. Democrats and the media have alleged Trump conspired with his Ukrainian counterpart to interfere in the next election by investigating the Biden family in exchange for the release of nearly $400 million in military aid being withheld in an apparent “quid pro quo.” The aid however, was ultimately released and the Ukrainian president has denied knowledge of any such arrangement. Further, an unredacted transcript of the phone call declassified and released to the public reveals no scheme to pressure the Ukraine government into investigating political rivals.

Instead, the transcript shows President Trump requesting Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate the origins of its involvement in peddling the Russia hoax in the United States and root out corruption in his own country.

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of a Ukrianian energy company earning $50,000 a month without any prior experience in the industry while Joe Biden was dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s compensation reveals the former vice president’s son made far more than comparable compensation packages to board members of other companies.

Ukraine’s involvement in pushing Russigate is well-documented. Grassley and Johnson’s demands for more information from the FBI on the issue would shed further light in the public’s interest on Ukraine’s election meddling in 2016.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/18/fbi-blows-off-senators-request-on-materials-related-to-ukrainian-dnc-contractor-in-2016/,2019-12-18
The Resistance Has Been Distracted,"Democrats have legitimate arguments against a Trump presidency. That isn’t to say those arguments are correct, or rooted in pure motives. It’s certainly not to say I agree with them, and it’s not an endorsement of impeachment either. Really, it’s the opposite.

We’ve had three years to digest Donald Trump’s victory, far from enough distance to fully understand “what happened,” but enough to agree his rise from primary underdog to leader of the free world was a symptom of serious pains in the electorate. I favor the Tim Carney explanation, advanced in “Alienated America,” that Trump’s win “was fueled by social decay and real suffering.” Whatever your preferred thesis, Trump’s opponents will enter the new year having spent the bulk of his presidency obsessing over the symptom without meaningfully addressing the cause.

Thus the year 2020 is set to open with an impeachment trial in the Senate. I understand that partisans are focused on partisan missions, namely the daily power struggles between red and blue that consume official Washington. In that respect, Democrats’ laser focus on impeachment makes some sense. But not a lot of it.

From Russia to the Mueller investigation to Ukraine to impeachment, Democrats and the media have spent three years consumed with melodrama, distracted from meaningfully dealing with the factors that precipitated this presidency. Democrats are in no better position to address those problems. The media is in no better position to cover them.

They will wake up on New Year’s Day, in an election year, to that reality. From 30,000 feet, their opposition in Trump’s first term amounts to a protracted battle over Russia and Ukraine. They’ve fixated on the symptom and neglected to treat the cause.

That’s not to say Democrats and the press entirely ignored everything else. But their top priorities have been clear enough. And that leaves Democrats less equipped to deal with Trump at the ballot box, and the press less equipped to understand why he’s still there.

How to explain this stagnation? Say a time traveler approached top Democrats or media members in the wake of Trump’s 2016 victory—when they were busy issuing grand promises of reform—and conveyed the next three years would be spent in large part hammering allegations of Russian collusion and a quid pro quo with Ukraine. By all means, investigate what needs investigating. But would that have sounded like a wise allocation of time in the broader effort to mend some of the wounds that brought us here?

This brings us back to the beginning. There are legitimate arguments to be made against the Trump presidency. Democrats, and the president’s media opponents, still have not learned how to make them. That’s despite facing what they see as an existential threat, and the three years they’ve had to start addressing it. This was evident in Wednesday’s impeachment vote and will be evident in Thursday’s debate as well.

The daily fray is an alluring space, with the immediacy of Twitter and cable news, and the satisfaction of quick wins. But to the extent we’re able to separate ourselves from the moment and look from 30,000 feet, it really is remarkable to observe how the people most chastened by Trump’s victory have decided to spend their time in the years since it shocked them to their very core.

Will Dem Senators Running For President Recuse From Impeachment?,"Will Democratic senators actively running for president recuse themselves from the Senate impeachment trial?

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was strongly condemned for his comment that he would not be an impartial juror in a Senate trial. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said McConnell should “recuse” himself. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., said it was “horrifying” to hear Republicans express disdain for the House’s pending impeachment. She said that such comments cast doubt on whether the senators could deliver impartial justice.

If mere comments suggest a lack of necessary impartiality, the Democrats have a bit of a problem on their hands. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet of Colorado are all running for the Democratic Party nomination for president. How could these individuals have any hope of impartiality when their vote would influence the 2020 election by removing their biggest political opponent? The senators should be asked the question, even if their response would presumably be no.

The mere question illustrates the absurdity of these particular impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

Democrats are hinging their impeachment on charges that Trump’s request to Ukraine’s president to investigate corruption and 2016 election meddling is an unconstitutional request for help in the 2020 election. That’s because potential Democratic nominee Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s point man in Ukraine at the same time his son was being paid some $80,000 a month to serve on a troubled energy concern. Investigations into that company and Biden’s involvement in getting a particular prosecutor fired could help Trump in 2020, the argument goes.

It’s a tricky argument on a good day, but one made more difficult when Democrats running for president, in turn, are seeking to influence the 2020 election by working to remove their chief political opponent from office. If Democrats are expecting Republicans to be impartial “jurors,” will they also urge members of their own party to serve in the same capacity? And if they don’t will they also urge them to recuse themselves from the Senate impeachment trial? How can Democrats running for president possibly serve as an “impartial juror?”

In fact, it’s quite impossible for Senate Democrats who have pushed for impeachment, the top policy item on the Democratic agenda over the last three years, to genuinely claim “impartiality,” when reversal of the 2016 election results has been the goal from the start.

First, Democrats centered their efforts on Russia relying on a famously discredited Steele dossier to peddle a grand Russian conspiracy theory accusing Trump and members of his campaign of being Russian agents. After the unfounded allegations prompted a two-year special counsel investigation run by Robert Mueller with unlimited resources, Mueller’s team was unable to find one person, let alone the president himself, had colluded with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton.

Now, less than a year out from the next election, Democrats have desperately placed their bets on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. In September, details from an anonymous whistleblower complaint emerged of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky alleging Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate political opponents at home. Democrats have centered in on nearly $400 million in withheld military aid to accuse Trump of engaging in an apparent “quid pro quo,” where Zelensky would receive the aid in exchange for launching the requested investigations.

An unredacted transcript of the call declassified and released to the public however, reveals no such arrangement. Contrary to reports from the mainstream media, the transcript reveals Trump urging Zelensky to rid Ukraine of the corruption plaguing its country, which possesses a reputation as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. The transcript also makes public Trump’s request that Zelensky get to the bottom of Ukraine’s origins of peddling the Russia hoax, which did irreparable harm to the United States.

Despite weeks of Democratic-run hearings in the House failing to surface any incriminating evidence against the president, Democrats are expected to pass articles of impeachment by a purely partisan vote over to the Senate later this afternoon for a trial to start in the new year. Democrats in the Senate seeking their party’s presidential nomination should each be asked whether they plan to recuse themselves from the coming trial given their own logic.

4 Reasons Trump’s Impeachment Is The Weakest In U.S. History,"President Donald Trump joined Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson in the club of impeached presidents Wednesday night. Like the other two, Trump will be acquitted by the Senate once the articles of impeachment are delivered.

The case for Trump’s impeachment is the weakest of the three. If we include Richard Nixon, who resigned on his way to impeachment, it’s the weakest of the four. Here’s why.

1. No Actual Crime

Previous impeachments at least had a crime. Andrew Johnson was the first U.S. president to be impeached. He faced 11 articles of impeachment, mostly built around his violation of the Tenure of Office Act of 1867. That act limited the power of presidents to fire employees in Senate-approved positions without the consent of the Senate. While the law was blatantly unconstitutional, Johnson did violate it by getting rid of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.

Clinton was impeached for actual crimes that would get the rest of us in a whole lot of trouble. He was impeached for lying to a grand jury about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, false statements he’d made in an earlier deposition, and false statements he allowed his attorney to make about witness tampering. He was also impeached for obstructing justice in a case filed against him by encouraging Lewinsky to make a false statement and give false testimony, by hiding gifts he’d given to her, getting her a job in exchange for favorable testimony, attempted witness tampering with his secretary, and making false and misleading statements to jurors.

Nixon would have been impeached for obstructing an investigation into the unlawful break-in by his Committee to Re-Elect the President at the Watergate building and using the IRS and other agencies to violate others’ privacy.

By contrast, President Trump was not impeached for any recognizable crime. Critics of Trump note that no crime is necessary to impeach the president. While that’s true, it speaks to how weak the Democrats’ case against Trump is.

2. Punishing Trump for Exercising Constitutional Privileges

Trump is being impeached for abusing his power and for obstructing Congress. The first charge relates to complaints with how Trump handled foreign policy with Ukraine. In a friendly phone call with the Ukraine president, Trump asked for help investigating corruption issues in the country. Since some of the corruption touched on the family of Joe Biden, Democrats say Trump abused his power since Biden may be his 2020 election opponent.

Biden was the Obama administration’s point man in Ukraine when his son, Hunter, who had no expertise in the region or industry, was being paid $80,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy concern there. Setting aside that charge, the second charge is more troubling.

Democrats say that Trump’s decision to exercise his constitutional privilege to protect executive communication means he should be removed from office. That’s their second charge — obstruction of Congress. Many presidents have battled with Congress over their executive privilege and what it covers, but the idea that the debate is cause for impeachment is remarkably weak. If President Trump had defied a court order to turn over documents, that would make for a stronger case. But that hasn’t happened.

3. Bipartisan Opposition Instead of Bipartisan Support

Previous impeachments had bipartisan support. In Trump’s case, not a single Republican supported impeachment and several Democrats declined to support it. This is a remarkable turn of events from the time that impeachment first began to be lobbied for. The media and others in the resistance pushed impeachment within hours of Trump’s inauguration.

The initial plan was to spin up a special counsel that would deliver a report on collusion with Russia to steal the election. That dream fizzled with the inability to find a single American, much less anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign, who had done so. But at its onset, the plan allegedly had Republican support. Now, no Republicans are joining Rep. Adam Schiff and Rep. Jerry Nadler in their impeachment goals.

The plan was clearly to start with limited Republican support and grow from there. Instead, there was no growth in the ranks of Republican support. And while high percentages of Americans have told pollsters for months that they would like the Bad Orange Man impeached, there was no movement in those polls toward more support. Even more surprisingly, Trump’s approval ratings went up. This shows us that the bipartisan growth and momentum that was needed isn’t happening.

4. Failure to Do the Work

Previous impeachments and impeachment efforts required a great deal of work from congressional and other investigators. Some spent years investigating matters before bringing them to Congress.

In this case, impeachment was built entirely around a late July phone call with Ukraine’s president. The original impeachment effort was to say that the phone call violated campaign finance law. That charge morphed into claims of bribery, extortion, and obstruction of justice. By the time two articles of impeachment were drafted, it was clear that the case had lost focus.

After the vote, some Democrats suggested that the House could keep investigating the matter. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi herself signaled a lack of confidence in her members’ work when she said that the House might not even send the articles over to the Senate for a trial. She claimed that was because of how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell planned to run the trial, but he said he would use the same rules that were used in the Clinton trial.

House members also coordinated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on how the Senate trial should go. He told television cameras that he would like to call witnesses to further investigate the underlying matter. This would only be necessary if the House didn’t bother to complete their investigation because they were rushing.

Democrats hope to tarnish Trump heading into 2020. While they have done their best, what they’ve mostly provided is the weakest impeachment case in U.S. history.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/19/4-reasons-trumps-impeachment-is-the-weakest-in-u-s-history/,2019-12-19

Nancy Pelosi Continues Withholding Articles Of Impeachment From Senate,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats behind closed doors Tuesday that the she would continue to hold the passed articles of impeachment back from the upper chamber until Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered details on how a trial will be conducted.

Pelosi’s comments as reported by the Washington Post showcase the Democrats’ latest power grab to bend the impeachment proceedings in the Senate to their will demanding the testimony of new witnesses.

After the House passed two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress by an almost uniform partisan vote, Pelosi announced she would be withholding the articles from moving forward to the Senate.

Pelosi’s decision to bring a halt to the impeachment process comes as Democrats aim to amp up pressure on Republicans to conduct the trial in the Senate on the Democrats’ terms even after operating an unfair process rushed in the House.

The impeachment proceedings lodged against President Donald Trump were kicked off by an anonymous whistleblower complaint alleging Trump conspired with the Ukrainian president to interfere in the next U.S. presidential election. The complaint, marked credible and urgent by the intelligence community inspector general but not by the Department of National Intelligence sparked rampant speculation by impeachment-hungry Democrats and the mainstream media as a smoking gun to end the Trump presidency.

Soon after knowledge of the complaint surfaced in the media however, the White House declassified and released an unredacted transcript of the July 25 phone call in question under the complaint between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats have tried incessantly to paint the call as damning evidence illustrating that Trump invited Ukraine to get involved in the next election by investigating the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in military aid. The withheld aid was ultimately released without a Ukrainian investigation.

In reality, a true and honest reading of the transcript exposes an American president urging the Ukrainian leader to root out corruption in the eastern European nation and requesting that Zelensky investigate the origins of Ukraine’s peddling of the Russian collusion hoax in the United States.

In more than two months of rushed proceedings, Democrats failed to unearth evidence worth of a “high crime and misdemeanor,” that warrants the extreme measure of impeachment despite the entire process run in the lower chamber being slanted to disadvantage Republicans. To the contrary, the Democrats’ own witnesses exonerated Trump of any wrongdoing regarding Ukraine.

Democrats impeached the president anyway, and now Democrats are demanding the Senate call additional witnesses to prolong the process and find the incriminating evidence to oust Trump from the Oval Office. Incriminating evidence will be hard to find however, as the House hearings exposed to the public, there isn’t any.

Pelosi’s present play to prohibit the process from moving onward has further undercut the entire premise of a rushed procedure in the House, which sought to remove the president from office as quick as possible citing Trump’s hold on power as an urgent threat to the survival of the republic.

McConnell has made clear his desire for a fair and quick trial in the Senate and has pushed back on Democratic demands to call more witnesses to prolong a process that has been a sham from the start launched in a desperate effort to reverse the results of the 2016 election.

Republican Senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham proposed changing the Senate rules regarding impeachment altogether to remove Pelosi from the process and begin the trial proceedings without the House speaker’s approval.

Amazon’s ‘The Report’ Tortures The Facts About Dan Jones’s Info Ops,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. An unelected bureaucrat disagrees with the president, and decides to take matters into his own hands. Classified material is leaked to the press, and we learn America is a corrupt war machine. Fin.

No, this isn’t the story of the Ukraine leaks, it’s “The Report,” a new movie on Amazon Prime, starring acclaimed actor and Star Wars star Adam Driver. It’s brought to you by Vice, which is a website or magazine most of the time, but also does movies apparently.

“The Report” tells the allegedly true story of Dan Jones, who we’re supposed to believe is a super patriot who loves justice and thinks the CIA interrogation program is torture. Jones heads a team of investigators from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a job he was appointed to by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (played by Annette Benning, who looks just like Feinstein. Hat tip to the hair and make-up team). The evil forces of practicality and reality eventually squash Jones’ plans to release thousands of pages of classified information to the public, but several hundred pages still come out.

And that’s about it.

This film is dull – not as bad as “Camp X-Ray,” but much worse than “Road to Guantanamo.” It spends a lot of time showing Jones working alone, or in meetings where he comes off as rash or emotionally upset. The audience understands the point after the first of these scenes, but then we are subjected to a dozen or so more of them for good measure. And please don’t play a drinking game where you take a shot every time someone tells Jones he looks tired or asks about his non-existent social and love life. You will end up in a coma.

Jones is supposed to be a sympathetic character, but everyone else seems more reasonable. Feinstein, John Brennan (convincingly played by Ted Levine, famous for his “it places the lotion in the basket” role in “Silence of the Lambs”), Cofer Black, President Obama, Sen. John McCain, a fictional lawyer, the CIA, and even the main villains come across as doing something other than worrying and complaining.

We’re supposed to hear that Dan’s report is 6,000 pages long, that he reviewed millions of pages of CIA files, and think, “Oh, that’s a lot of work.” By focusing on Jones’ uncompromising and obsessive interactions with everyone, the audience is left with more a sense that Jones is suffering from significant mental health issues.

Fact and Fiction

Over the weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that he saw that film. He called it “fiction.” I think we can forgive the former director of the CIA for his gentle hyperbole. The scary part of “The Report” is not the parts that are mischaracterized or left out, although those are huge problems. The problem is the parts of it that are real.

Dan Jones is real. So we have good reason to look at him and to question the accuracy of his narrative. More recently, Jones has been in the news for spreading misinformation on behalf of Democrats, but more on that later. The best construction on his behavior is that he’s a lousy analyst and investigator. Another explanation is that he’s a liar.

Much of the intrigue and pouting faces in the film are caused by Jones’s allegations that the CIA “spied” on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) investigative staff. The film paints this as possibly due to Jones’ removal of a classified report from a secure office to his own office. He is shown putting it in a safe, which might be an appropriate place for it, but it might not. Luckily the film doesn’t get too far into the weeds on proper marking and handling of classified materials, because that’s even less fun than watching Jones be sad.

But we can all agree Jones removed the report in the film. The character knows this violates policy and possibly federal law, so the CIA’s investigation into the missing document is actually appropriate.

In reality, there were other reasons to investigate the SSCI team working for Jones. There was a steady stream of leaks of classified information that started after the SSCI investigation began. The team was run by Democratic staff, like Jones. To this day, the narrative continues to be “the CIA spied on Congress, which was just trying to do oversight.”

Here’s the truth. Jones’ office was in a CIA building. Jones’ computer was owned and operated by the CIA. The CIA, while investigating leaks of their data, looked at a computer system they owned and operated. Jones had a login and password, but this was hardly a congressional office, or a congressional system.

Maybe Jones didn’t leak things to the press, but someone from SSCI did. That someone could have been James Wolfe, who was having the affair with reporter Ali Watkins. Wolfe was an SSCI staff member who was in charge of making sure people followed security practices correctly. Watkins, when she was 22 years old, was part of a team at McClatchy who were finalists for a Pulitzer Prize writing about… the torture report.

Wolfe was arrested. Yes, this really happened. It’s not fiction. It’s also not in the movie. (Also recall that Clint Eastwood’s latest film was severely criticized for daring to suggest that a reporter might have had an inappropriate relationship with an FBI agent, because supposedly this sort of thing never happens in real life.) The end of the film shows Jones walking down the National Mall, looking grim, and mentions how no one ever went to jail.

Partisan Disinformation

But what ever happened to Jones? Oh, don’t worry. he landed on his feet. He gathered $50 million and pushed dubious Russia collusion conspiracies about Donald Trump to the press for three years. It’s called the “Democracy Integrity Project” and Paul Sperry wrote a great article about it in 2019.

Most people know Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, Christopher Steele, and their role in spreading the Russia-collusion narrative. They were merely the fathers of that gem of total fantasy. Jones, it turns out, is the guy who turned it into a wall-to-wall press event. He runs a $50 million partisan disinformation machine.

Perhaps no one has worked to deceive the press and the American people over Russiagate more than Jones. Given that he’s clearly a partisan hitman and a voracious spreader of false information, why would we believe anything about his version of what the CIA did, much less think the movie version of his story is anything less than dishonest and self-serving?

It’s actually odd releasing this movie in the last month, given the recent inspector general report’s revelations that put yet another nail in the coffin of the Trump-Russia narrative. Since his time at SSCI, Jones has been revealed to be totally wrong and obviously partisan. The parallels between the Jones behavior while at SSCI and the Ukraine “whistleblower” are too similar not to notice. A reasonable person might draw the conclusion they are running the same kind of operation.

"U.S., Iraqi Officials Accuse Iran Of Shooting Down Passenger Jet","UPDATE: Iranian anti-aircraft defenses shot down a European passenger jet Wednesday night killing all on board, United States and Iraqi officials told Newsweek Thursday morning. The alleged attack, which these officials say was likely accidental, killed all 176 passengers and crew during Wednesday night’s hostilities with the United States. The crash immediately drew international scrutiny after rapid explanations of technical failure raised suspicions.

Ukraine International Flight 752 took off from Iran’s capital, Tehran, bound for Ukraine’s capital city Kiev at 6:12 a.m, local time. Iran had fired a barrage of missiles on three U.S. bases in Iraq just three and a half hours earlier, and was on high alert for retaliatory strikes from missiles or aircraft. President Donald Trump had threatened to hit 52 targets in Iran in response to an attack on U.S. forces, but the Pentagon has since issued an analysis that the strikes were designed to not injure American life and to save face.

Minutes into the plane’s initial ascent, at just over 7,000 feet and traveling approximately 300 miles per hour, all communication with Flight 752 was lost. No distress beacon was issued and no communication indicating mechanical issues were transmitted from the crew. Images resembling “fragments of a Tor M-1 missile” were reportedly found in a nearby, according to Newsweek.

Witnesses report the plane crashed from the sky while completely ablaze, and unconfirmed footage appears to back this up. While both Iran and Ukraine’s embassy quickly blamed mechanical failure, the Ukrainian embassy deleted this statement shortly later. Flames kept rescue crew at bay for hours, Reuters reports, and debris was scattered over hundreds of yards of farm fields.

“I just know airplanes don’t come apart like that,” former Federal Aviation Administration chief investigator Jeff Guzzetti told The Washington Post, adding he sees “all the earmarks of an intentional act.”

“Planes just don’t blow up in midair,” Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia told The New York Times. “It doesn’t work like that.”

While it’s standard practice to recover and send the plane’s flight recorder, or “black box,” to the manufacturer to assist in the investigation, Iran Civil Aviation Organization chief Ali Abedzadeh told state media the flight recorder will not be sent to Boeing, an American company, The Wall Street Journal reports. Abedzadeh did not rule out sending the recorder to a country other than the United States for analysis.

The plane, a Boeing 737-800, has a solid safety record. “There are more than 8,000 CFM56 engines in service on 737 aircraft worldwide,” The Guardian reports, “making it the most popular engine-aircraft combination in commercial aviation.”

Most international flights through Iranian airspace rerouted in anticipation of hostilities between the United States and Iran, while others cancelled flights after Iranian strikes in Iraq.

The U.K. Telegraph reports passengers’ nationalities as 83 Iranians, 63 Canadians, four Afghans, and 24 Europeans, including Swedes, Germans and Ukrainians, in addition to the nine Ukrainian crew. Canada and Sweden are permitted to join the investigation but are barred from looking into the recording device.

Iran has invited Ukraine to assist with the investigation. The investigation will be difficult to trust. “In global aviation we would like to think that the technical experts will rule the day,” former Federal Aviation Administration administrator Michael Huerta told the Times, “but given that it’s Iran, we’ll have to wait and see.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/09/anti-aircraft-attack-fears-increase-for-european-passenger-jet-crash-in-iran/,2020-01-09
5 Times Media Spin Biased The Crossfire Hurricane Investigation,"In addition to exposing substantial evidence of FBI misconduct and malfeasance, the recent inspector general report on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse revealed that the Crossfire Hurricane team and Department of Justice and FBI leaders fell for many of the Russia collusion narratives the press pushed. Here are the top five.

1. Blessed Saint Christopher Steele

The media pushed glowing accounts of FBI source Christopher Steele, portraying him as a top MI6 Russian spy, the man behind the dismantling of the international soccer FIFA bribery conspiracy, and a long-time reliable source for U.S. intelligence agencies. The IG report revealed the press accounts greatly embellished the dossier author’s resume and that the Crossfire Hurricane team regurgitated the press’ puffery to the FISA court.

For instance, while the FBI told the FISA court that Steele’s reporting had been “corroborated and used in criminal proceedings,” based on the urban legend that Steele had brought down the FIFA fiefdom, the IG report revealed that Steele’s connection to the FIFA matter consisted of him suggesting “the FBI should talk to a contact who had information on corruption in the FIFA organization,” and “it was the contact’s information, in part, that led to the opening of the FIFA investigation.”

But the FIFA case agent and prosecutor told the IG that “Steele did not have any role in the investigation itself, he did not provide court testimony, and his information did not appear in any indictments, search warrants, or other court filings.” Further, while the FBI notes review by the IG “referenced that Steele had held a ‘moderately senior’ position in Moscow,” the FISA applications called Steele “high-ranking.” Also, a thorough review of Steele’s reporting concluded his intel was at most, “minimally corroborated.”

Rather than “‘turn the file upside down’ looking for information” about Steele’s performance as a confidential human source (CHS), as his handling agent said should have done, the Crossfire Hurricane team ran with the media narrative. Even then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates seemed snuckered, telling the IG that she “believe[d] criminal cases had been made, or he had participated in criminal cases,” referring to Steele.

The FBI’s misapprehension of Steele’s history wasn’t a mere fleeting idolatry. The IG report revealed that as late as July 2018, the FBI remained as confident in Steele as the press was. At that late date, in the Rule 13 Letter sent to the FISA court to update the previously filed FISA applications, the FBI maintained it “accessed Steele as reliable,” “for the reasons described in the FISA applications.” While the Rule 13 letter informed the court that Steele had been responsible for the Yahoo News disclosure, the FBI continued to defend the reliability of Steele’s reporting.

By then, though, the FBI knew full well that Steele’s election reporting had not been corroborated; that his prior reporting had been only minimally corroborated and never used in court proceedings; that Steele’s primary sub-source had called into question the election reporting; that in several instances, the reporting “was inconsistent with information gathered by the Crossfire Hurricane team”; and that some of Steele’s “intel,” such as Michael Cohen’s purported meeting in Prague, was “not true.” Yet the FBI was so smitten by the media’s portrayal of Steele that they presented the press’s party line of Marvelous Mr. Steele to the FISA court.

2. Republicans Funded the Steele Dossier

Another media myth the IG report revealed the FBI and DOJ believed concerns Republicans’ role in the Steele dossier. There was none, but the press’s careless reporting quickly conflated a previous Republican contract with Fusion GPS to perform general opposition research on Donald Trump—which did not involve Steele or a focus on Russia—with Fusion GPS’s hiring of Steele in June 2016 on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

The DNC/Clinton contract was specifically to “obtain information about whether Russia was trying to achieve a particular outcome in the 2016 U.S. elections, what personal and business ties then candidate Trump had in Russia, and whether there were any ties between the Russian government and Trump or his campaign.”

This distinction matters, because if Republicans had previously hired Steele, that fact would counter claims Steele held a pro-Democrat bias that influenced his reporting. Also, by conflating the two separate contracts, it creates the appearance that Trump’s Republican opponents were pushing the Russia collusion hoax before Hillary got involved. But neither is true.

Yet so complete was the press’s conflation that Yates was confused on this point, telling investigators in the IG’s office that her understanding was that Steele, “at one point, was actually working for someone connected with the Republican Party.” Yates also told the IG “that she remembered hearing that Steele’s research was conducted first for a Republican and then later for a Democrat, but she said she did not recall whether she heard that before or after she left the Department in late January 2017.”

3. The Platform Party Change That Wasn’t

A third time the FBI fell for the media spin concerned former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page’s supposed involvement in massaging the Republican Party platform concerning Ukraine. According to the IG’s report, “all of the Carter Page FISA applications alleged that Page participated in drafting the RNC’s platform change on providing lethal assistance to Ukraine. The FISA applications alleged that the platform change on Ukraine would not include a provision to provide weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces, controverting Republican Party policy.”

Again, this allegation followed the conventional wisdom but was wrong, in two respects. First, the Republican Party platform never called for providing “weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces.” Rather, as reporter Byron York detailed, the draft platform read: “We will meet the return of Russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will not accept any territorial change in Eastern Europe imposed by force, in Ukraine or elsewhere, and will use all appropriate measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination.”

As York further explained, when the platform committee met before the start of the GOP convention, one delegate proposed an amendment to include “we also support providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine’s armed forces” language. But in response to an objection by a Trump aide, J.D. Gordon, the platform committee changed the language from providing “lethal defensive weapons” for Ukraine, and instead promised “appropriate assistance to the armed forces of Ukraine.” So that was the second error: It was Gordon and not Page who pushed for the change in the proposed amendment to the RNC platform.

Yet the FISA secret surveillance applications all painted Page as responsible for changing the platform, just as the media had. Plus, the FBI did more than merely believe the press’s narrative—they cited the fake news from “identified news organizations” in the FISA applications to bolster the charge that Page bore responsibility for weakening the platform.

In fact, the FBI believed the media narrative about the platform change over the intel the bureau’s own CHS, Stefan Halper, had obtained: In an October 2, 2016, monitored conversation with Page, the Trump advisor told Halper, with regard the platform committee proceedings, that he had “stayed clear of that,” even though there were “a lot of conspiracy theories that I was one of them.” “In retrospect,” Page added in the secretly monitored conversation, “it’s way better off that I remained at arm’s length.”

4. The 30,000 Missing Emails

A fourth narrative that took hold with the Crossfire Hurricane team concerned Trump’s late-July joke, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”

Many in the press played Trump’s comments as “quite literally” an entreaty to Russia to hack Clinton’s emails. However, this narrative made no sense because “the 30,000 emails” were ones Clinton had deleted from her homebrewed server, so there was nothing to hack.

Soon, however, the media narrative took on a life of its own, with the press and Democrat politicians painting Trump’s comments as concerning the DNC’s emails that were hacked and later released by WikiLeaks. The IG report now reveals that the FBI fell for the press and Democrat’s dissembling, as seen by the FBI’s misinterpretation of a comment Page made to Halper in August 2016.

During that FBI-monitored meeting, Halper asked the Trump aide whether there was an “October Surprise” in the works. According to the IG report, “Page stated that there would be a ‘different October Surprise’ this year.” Page then shared what he called his own “conspiracy theory” about “the next email dump,” saying it would be the “33,000.”

Any political junkie not high on the left-leaning media’s anti-Trump dope would have known then that a reference to “33,000” emails meant Clinton’s missing emails and not the DNC’s hacked emails. Yet, in the FISA application, “the FBI assessed that these statements, along with other evidence, indicated that Page was aware of the pending leak of DNC emails,” proving yet again that the FBI fell for the press’ propaganda.

5. The Russia Collusion Hoax

Bruce Ohr, who featured largely in the IG report for his improper role as a conduit between Christopher Steele and the FBI following Steele’s termination as a CHS, provides a final example of the higher echelons consuming the media’s hype. It appears Ohr swallowed the Russia collusion narrative whole.

According to the IG report, on December 7, 2016 then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Ohr convened an “interagency meeting” “regarding strategy in dealing with Russian Oligarch 1,” who is widely recognized to be Oleg Deripaska. The IG report detailed how after that meeting, one of Ohr’s junior colleague, asked Ohr “why the U.S. government would support trying to work with Russian Oligarch 1.”

According to the IG report, “Ohr responded that ‘Steele provided information that the Trump campaign had been corrupted,” and Ohr then told the junior colleague that the “allegations went ‘all the way to the President’” The junior staffer added that “Ohr said to her that this information was ‘the basis for the [Russian Oligarch 1] discussion.’”

This exchange reveals Ohr had so bought the media hype that he believed President-elect Donald Trump was corrupted by the Russians. Either that, or Ohr was intentionally selling the same fake news. “To whom?” is another question.

John Bolton’s Testimony Would Not Be The Smoking Gun Democrats Need,"You have to give credit to congressional Democrats for one thing: They are an extremely hopeful bunch. After years of Russia investigations aimed at toppling Donald Trump, they came away with what Grandmother would have called “bupkis.” But, not daunted, they quickly latched onto a whistleblower report about a phone call with Ukraine, and launched an up tempo effort, one last-ditch attempt to take the president down.

The result of this exertion did include a vote to impeach Trump, but did not attract a single GOP vote. This is also almost certain to the result in the senate trial as well. But wait! Now former National Security Adviser John Bolton has agreed to testify if called, and the Democrats are racing toward Lucy again, confident this time she won’t move the football.

The excitement from Democrats comes from the fact that Bolton in the past few months has sent a few mysterious tweets and said through lawyers that he does have information that did not come up in impeachment. Bolton may well have new information, but the idea that he is going walk into the Senate chamber if subpoenaed with a smoking gun is pure wish casting.

The crux of the dispute between Democrats and Republicans over the Trump administration’s action to delay funding to Ukraine is not over whether it happened, but whether the president was acting within his authority. It is almost inconceivable that Bolton could provide any evidence that would change that basic dynamic.

We know from the impeachment testimony that Bolton was almost certainly not happy with the way the Ukraine situation was handled. Like other establishment foreign policy figures, he was probably not a fan of the credence that Trump gave to Rudy Giuliani’s concerns over Ukraine. But ultimately, so what? We already know many diplomats and career officials disagreed with it. The question is whether it was a legitimate act of presidential power, or an attempt to bribe Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden and by extension, Joe Biden.

On that point, what can John Bolton possibly say that would prove Trump’s intent was malicious, and not genuine concern about taxpayer dollars falling into corrupt hands? Is he really going to say, “The president told me he doesn’t care about corruption, he just wanted to get that pesky Joe Biden and get him good?” Is there anyone on the face of the planet who thinks that such a conversation could have taken place?

The best plausible testimony Democrats can hope for is that Bolton reveals he expressed opposition, but so did a half dozen people who already testified, and just like them, nobody elected John Bolton to be president. The problem for Democrats has always been here that they cannot prove that Trump’s intent was not to ensure the country didn’t throw good money after bad.

At this point, the Democrats have thrown so much spaghetti at the wall during this process that there is none left in the water. They achieved the one thing in their power, the impeachment itself, albeit with no Republicans and no polling consensus. This is literally as good as it’s going to get. Even if they convince four GOP senators to call Bolton, somehow apparently without the White House being able to call, say, Hunter Biden, or the whistleblower, there is no reason to think he would move the needle one iota.

But, hope springs eternal in the Trump addled minds of the Democrats, maybe just maybe, they think, if they keep this sham process going on long enough something good might happen. They are like addicts at a slot machine convinced they have pulled the lever so many times that they must be due. One thing seems certain. John Bolton is not going to be their jackpot. In fact, they will at this point, almost certainly leave the casino known empty-handed.

People Who Must Testify If The Senate Calls New Impeachment Witnesses,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to pressure Senate Republicans to call new witnesses in the coming impeachment trial by holding the articles of impeachment hostage until Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky caved to her demands.

Pelosi eventually acknowledged she had no leverage in her desperate gamble to unearth new evidence in an impeachment effort based on no crime. On Friday, Pelosi announced she will work with colleagues in the House on transmitting the articles to the Senate to allow a trial to move forward without one concession from McConnell.

As Pelosi moves ahead with passing the articles to the House, Democrats are pushing to allow new witnesses to testify before Congress after weeks of rushed proceedings in the lower chamber failed to bring to light any incriminating evidence against the president. To the contrary, Democratic witnesses either exonerated the president of all wrongdoing or destroyed their own credibility during their testimony, making for the weakest impeachment case in American history.

It’s no surprise, therefore, that Democrats are pleading for new witnesses as if their case depended on it, because it does. The latest polling on impeachment illustrate just how poorly the proceedings have gone for Democrats. According to Real Clear Politics’ aggregate of polls on the issue, support for impeachment went underwater after Democrats’ House hearings. Now Americans remain nearly split on impeachment, with those opposed with a slight majority.

If Republicans do bow to Democrats’ demands for new witnesses, it would only make sense that the following individuals came forward for the proceedings. If Democrats had taken their job seriously in the House, these people already would have come forward to testify.

The Whistleblower

Democrats have pinned their impeachment case on an anonymous whistleblower complaint lodged against the president based on a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint based on no first-hand knowledge of the call was marked as both credible and urgent by the intelligence community inspector general but not by the Department of National Intelligence. The complaint charged Trump of pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart to launch an investigation into the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in military aid.

In response to the knowledge of the complaint leaked to the media, the White House broke precedent and declassified an unredacted transcript of the phone call between the two world leaders revealing no such arrangement. The “high crime and misdemeanor” unveiled in the damning transcript’s release? That Trump urged the Ukrainian president to weed out the corruption plaguing his own government and investigate Ukraine’s involvement in peddling the Russia collusion hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States. That’s the made-up crime Democrats have run on for their four-year impeachment crusade.

It is only reasonable, then, that the whistleblower testify before lawmakers in the Senate trial. Real Clear Investigations has reported the identity of the whistleblower to be Eric Ciaramella, a former intelligence employee whose profile appears to fit the description of circumstantial reporting about the alleged whistleblower.

The whistleblower’s complaint is what allegedly kicked off Democrats’ impeachment proceedings last fall. The whistleblower’s testimony would have therefore been critical in serious impeachment proceedings in the House. If Democrats are going to argue for new witnesses in the coming Senate trial, the whistleblower must come forward to offer what he or she knew to the American public before ousting their Democratically elected president.

Hunter Biden and former Vice President Joe Biden

The ongoing impeachment proceedings against the president have exposed more about the Biden family than about President Trump. The released transcript of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky shows Trump pointing out Hunter Biden’s shady business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company as an example of nepotism to be dealt with in a country notorious for corruption.

While his father oversaw U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president, Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company raking in $50,000 to nearly $85,000 a month despite no prior experience in the energy industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much the vice president’s son was being showered with excess compensation, as board members who possess extensive knowledge in their field earn far less at corporations of comparable size.

On the campaign trail, Joe Biden has denied having discussed business with his son while Hunter served on the board of a foreign corporation. According to The New Yorker last summer, however, the two had discussed the arrangement.

“Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’” Hunter recalled to the magazine. “And I said, ‘I do.’”

Meanwhile, Democrats are terrified of Hunter Biden’s potential testimony while calling other witnesses to be subpoenaed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California reiterated his concern on a Monday appearance on ABC’s “The View.”

“There is not much light Joe Biden or Hunter Biden can shed on the president’s conduct,” Schiff said.

“Then why not have them show up, if you have nothing to hide?” pressed Abby Huntsman.

“It would convert the Senate trial into the same kind of sham proceeding,” Schiff said, as if the impeachment proceedings haven’t already been a sham to begin with.

It’s clear that Hunter Biden doesn’t want to talk about his work in Ukraine either.

“One thing that I don’t have to do is sit here and open my kimono,” Hunter said in an interview with ABC News in October.

With both Hunter and Joe Biden’s business dealings called into question from the impeachment proceedings, a Senate trial that includes new witnesses must include the Bidens who are at the center of the investigations into the president’s dealings with Ukraine.

Adam Schiff’s Staff

The anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment case coordinated with staff working for Rep. Adam Schiff before proceeding with filing the complaint, according to The New York Times.

While Schiff denies knowing the identity of the whistleblower, which is highly unlikely, his staff undoubtedly knew and guided the impeachment process in the House with special knowledge withheld from the rest of the rest of the chamber. Given the weeks of closed-door depositions leading up to the public hearings, the knowledge of Schiff’s staff throughout the investigation would be critical to any Senate trial in which new witnesses were to be called.

Schiff’s staff should be asked under oath exactly what they knew and how it guided their decision-making moving forward leading up to impeachment and throughout the process.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/14/people-who-must-testify-if-the-senate-calls-new-witnesses-in-impeachment-trial/,2020-01-14
Bureaucratic Investigation Claims Trump’s Withholding Of Ukraine Aid Violated Law,"House Democrats requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a legal branch of Congress. GAO’s resulting report claims President Donald Trump broke federal law by withholding Ukrainian security aid in July 2019, after Congress approved the funds.

The GAO determined the Trump administration broke the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. This law creates a mechanism for the executive branch to ask Congress to reconsider a funding decision or appropriation that’s already been signed into law.

“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law. [The Office of Management and Budget] withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control act,” said Thomas Armstrong, General Counsel for the GAO.

The report also concluded that the Trump Office of Management and Budget did not provide all the information needed to fulfill their duties.

“[The Office of Management and Budget] and State have failed, as of yet, to provide the information we need to fulfill our duties under the ICA regarding potential impoundments of [Foreign Military Financing] funds,” Armstrong said.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland requested the GAO investigation in December.

“This bombshell legal opinion from the independent Government Accountability Office demonstrates, without a doubt, that the Trump administration illegally withheld security assistance from Ukraine,” Van Hollen told the Washington Post.

They key phrase in Van Hollen’s statement is that the GAO’s report is simply an “opinion.” Rachel Semmel, director of communications for the Office of Management and Budget, said the GAO’s decision has no legal baring on the Trump administration.

“We disagree with GAO’s opinion. OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President’s priorities and with the law,” Semmel said.

The GAO has a long history of attempting to stay relevant in the executive branch, even long before the current impeachment of President Trump. The GAO also has a record of flip-flops. They were forced to reverse a faulty opinion on legal grounds when they opposed the reimbursement of federal employee travel costs. They have consistently rushed to insert themselves into the impeachment discussion and the OMB is hopeful they will be forced to reverse their opinion again.

Notably, the Obama administration was also at fault under the GAO’s rules. A 2014 report found Obama broke the law when he failed to notify Congress about the impending prisoner swap between Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and five Taliban leaders.

There was no legal action taken against the Obama administration for not abiding by the GAO in 2014. That same precedent should be upheld during the Trump administration as well. The OMB and Trump administration have no legal duty to abide by the GAO and their legal opinions.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister On Lev Parnas: ‘I Don’t Trust Any Word He Is Now Saying’,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told CNN he never spoke with Rudy Guiliani’s associate Lev Parnas.

“Frankly, I have not spoken with [Lev Parnas], and again, frankly, I don’t trust any word he is now saying,” Prystaiko said.

On Wednesday, in an interview with CNN, Parnas said Trump’s efforts in Ukraine were all about 2020 and were focused on personal interests, not the interests of the United States.

“That was the way everyone viewed it,” Parnas told CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. “That was the most important thing, for him to stay on for four years and keep the fight going. I mean, there was no other reason for [withholding the Ukrainian security assistance].”

During an interview with MSNBC, Parnas said Trump and Guiliani directed him to urge Ukrainian officials to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. Parnas also said that Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Bill Barr, and former national security advisor John Bolton were aware of Trump’s work in Ukraine.

Prystaiko called into question Parnas’ claim that he met with Ukrainian foreign officials on Trump’s behalf by pointing out that Parnas may be lying for personal gain.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham also dismissed Parnas’ claims.

“These allegations are being made by a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison,” Grisham said. “The facts haven’t changed — the president did nothing wrong and this impeachment, which was manufactured and carried out by the Democrats has been a sham from the start.”

In a statement to MSNBC, Guiliani denied telling Ukrainian officials that Parnas was acting on behalf of himself and the Trump administration.

“All I can say is the truth. He’s a very sad situation,” Guiliani said.

"Rand Paul Is Right: If Senators Want Impeachment Witnesses, Call Biden","With President Trump’s impeachment trial set to begin next week, the Senate faces a stark choice: it can hold a legitimate trial that aims to get to the bottom of the allegations against the president, or it can stage an empty media spectacle like House Democrats did in their sham impeachment inquiry.

The problem for Democrats is that if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opts for the former, it will mean calling not just the witnesses Democrats want, like former National Security Advisor John Bolton, but also witnesses the administration wants, like Hunter Biden and Eric Ciaramella, the anti-Trump whistleblower who first set all of this in motion.

Indeed, it’s hard to see how Senate Democrats can demand to hear only from witnesses they think will bolster their preferred narrative—like Lev Parnas, the Soviet-born associate of Rudy Giuliani who was indicted for campaign law violations, and lately has been making grand accusations about Trump in the media—but not hear from Ciaramella or Biden. At least, they can’t do so while also maintaining the fiction that this impeachment is anything but bare-knuckle partisan politics, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s somber soliloquies about the Constitution notwithstanding.

In any case, Trump’s Republican allies in the Senate might not let them. In an interview with Politico on Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul said he will force the Senate to vote on subpoenaing President Trump’s preferred witnesses—specifically, Hunter Biden and Ciaramella—if four or more of his colleagues join with Democrats in calling for new witness testimony in the impeachment trial set to begin next week.

“My first preference would be to be done with it as soon as possible and not to have any witnesses,” Paul said. “If they insist on having people like [John] Bolton coming forward, my insistence will be not just one witness. But that the president should be able to call any witnesses that he deems necessary to his defense.”

Even if no GOP senators call for new witnesses, Paul’s point is valid: how on earth can the Senate conduct even the semblance of a credible, fair trial without hearing from the whistleblower, the person who started all this? Until he thought better of it, House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff insisted that it was essential to hear Ciamarella’s testimony. Senate Republicans could rightly argue that it still is.

Do Democrats, who are presumably interested in the unvarnished truth, really expect the American people to be content with the testimony of State Department bureaucrats with second- and third-hand knowledge, or law professors with strong opinions? After all, we were told this was serious business, the Constitution itself is at stake.

Moreover, could the American people really stomach the spectacle of an impeachment trial in which Joe and Hunter Biden are at the center of a dispute over whether Trump abused his power, but are never called to testify? Imagine Joe Biden, of all people, campaigning away in Iowa while his rivals are stuck in Washington litigating a show-trail spawned in part by his family’s alleged corruption in Ukraine.

There Are Real Questions For the Senate to Investigate

And what about the substance of the articles of impeachment? House Democrats charge that Trump abused his power when he delayed aid to Ukraine and pressured the Ukrainian president to launch investigations into 2016 election interference and corruption at Burisma, the energy company that paid Hunter Biden astronomical sums while Joe Biden was the U.S. government’s anticorruption point-man in Ukraine.

Clearly, the question about abuse of power is directly related to the question of whether there were legitimate reasons for Trump to delay the aid and ask for these investigations. Yes, an investigation of Hunter Biden’s dealings with Burisma might hurt his father’s presidential campaign, and therefore might accrue to Trump’s benefit. But that doesn’t mean it was Trump’s sole or even primary motivation, especially given Ukraine’s endemic corruption problems.

In the same way, an investigation of 2016 election meddling that, say, revealed Democratic Party officials solicited Ukrainian officials for dirt on the Trump campaign might damage Democrats in 2020, which would obviously help Trump. But was Trump’s only consideration his own personal benefit when he asked for this to be investigated? That’s not at all obvious, and in fact it’s easy to see why any U.S. president would want to get to the bottom of such a matter, regardless of how it affected an upcoming election.

Moreover, the whole question of whether a foreign policy decision might benefit Trump’s reelection bid in some way is misinformed. Any foreign policy move a first-term president can claim as a success will be politically beneficial. Just because it helps the president doesn’t mean he was using foreign policy to advance his personal political interests, as Democrats have alleged. In the same way, decrying a “quid pro quo,” as Democrats did for months about Trump’s July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, belies an oversimplified—and dishonest—view of American foreign policy, which is by nature transactional.

In other words, Democrats must prove that Trump’s only reason for requesting these investigations was that he believed it would hurt Joe Biden and the Democrats and benefit him personally in the 2020 election. They have to show that there were no other compelling reasons in the national interest for Trump to ask for the investigations. Manically repeating, as the media has, that 2016 election interference is a debunked “conspiracy theory” or that Joe Biden did nothing wrong just won’t cut it.

To do that, they will need to dig into whether there was anything in Ukraine worth investigating. That’s the one thing Democrats are not willing to do, which should tell you all you need to know about this impeachment.

Why Adam Schiff Is Too Biased To Manage Trump’s Impeachment Trial,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally named the managers who would present the articles of impeachment to the Senate and subsequently prosecute the impeachment case. The lead manager is House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Given the strong possibility Schiff will be called as a witness, however, should he even be permitted to serve as a manager in the upcoming impeachment trial?

According to Module Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7(a):

A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless: (1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;

(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or

(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.

Generally speaking, a manager’s role in an impeachment trial is similar to that of a prosecutor’s in a criminal trial. Like a criminal trial, the president’s lawyers will serve as defense counsel, and the Senate will serve as the jury.

In cases of presidential impeachments, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial. Moreover, all managers typically come from the same party, as they are all in favor of impeachment. While the managers serve as prosecutors, they do not determine the rules of the trial, which the Senate decides.

Schiff Doesn’t Fit Impeachment Manager Criteria

According to Democratic strategist Michael Gordon, an ideal manager choice would be a “credible, least-partisan-seeming” member, rather than an “overly partisan” member who would “not really be open to the facts.” Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for President Bill Clinton during his impeachment, noted that when choosing managers, congressional politics might win out over the most qualified managers.

According to Lockhart, “You could go, for example, with committee chairs and you could go by seniority. And that doesn’t necessarily give you the most effective prosecution.” In the instance of President Donald Trump’s impeachment, Schiff and the other managers will prosecute the case.

Rule 3.7 specifically applies to trials. While impeachment is quasi-judicial in nature, it is presumed that Rule 3.7 would still apply to those lawyers serving as impeachment trial managers. Moreover, the comments to Rule 3.7 provide some clarification as to the purpose of this rule. Specifically, Section (2) of the comments states:

The tribunal has proper objection when the trier of fact may be confused or misled by a lawyer serving as both advocate and witness. The opposing party has proper objection where the combination of roles may prejudice that party’s rights in the litigation. A witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others.

During the interminable impeachment inquiry, House Republicans intended to call Schiff as a fact witness, but House Democrats prohibited them from doing so in accordance with the one-sided resolution that gave Schiff the ultimate say as to who would be permitted to testify as a witness.

Senate Republicans Will Likely Call Schiff as a Witness

By way of review, the original whistleblower in the Ukraine matter filed a complaint without any firsthand knowledge of what transpired, failed to check off the appropriate box indicating he had met with one or more members of Schiff’s staff, and subsequently concealed these interactions despite reports that Schiff or members of his staff contacted or met with the alleged whistleblower before the complaint was filed.

Moreover, Schiff allegedly knew about the complaint or its contents before it became public. He also sent out a tweet on Aug. 28, 2019, before the complaint was public, that very closely resembled the allegations in the complaint. Schiff has also maintained he does not know the name or identity of the whistleblower and previously claimed, “We have not spoken directly to the whistleblower.”

At one point during the public testimony phase of the impeachment inquiry, however, Schiff threatened House Republicans of possible ethical violations if they named or mentioned the whistleblower. How could Schiff possibly know if this person’s name were mentioned if Schiff didn’t know his identity?

Given these various inconsistencies, Schiff will likely be called as a witness, as his testimony is relevant. The question, then, is whether he is a necessary witness. To date, House Democrats have prevented the whistleblower from testifying.

Therefore, Schiff could be deemed a necessary witness, for example, if he is the only person who could identify the staff members who initially spoke with the whistleblower, what they talked about, his relationship with the whistleblower including when and how they met, when they first discussed the Ukraine matter, what they discussed, whether anyone else was privy to their conversation, whether he encouraged the whistleblower to file a complaint, whether he played any role in preparing the complaint, and why he initially denied speaking with the whistleblower before he had filed his complaint. Schiff’s testimony will also shed light on his credibility and potential bias.

Schiff’s potential dual role as lawyer and witness does not appear to fit into one of Rule 3.7’s exceptions. Specifically, his testimony does not relate to an uncontested issue or to the nature and value of legal services. To the contrary, his testimony directly relates, in part, to the initiation of the whistleblower complaint and the underlying motivation and circumstances surrounding the filing. Finally, given that Schiff’s “team” consists of six additional and qualified attorneys, his disqualification as manager would not result in any hardship.

Schiff’s Dual Role Creates a Conflict of Interest

In this case, Schiff’s ability to serve as lawyer and witness could hinder or prejudice the president’s case in the eyes of the Senate and the American public. His dual role could also create a potential conflict of interest, depending on the information elicited through his testimony.

Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, was concerned about Schiff’s potential conflict of interest during the inquiry phase. According to Ratcliffe, Schiff has a conflict of interest in light of his secret interactions with the whistleblower before his false complaint against Trump was even submitted:

It’s more than just bias — it’s an actual legal conflict of interest. Schiff is using his authority as a chairman presiding over an impeachment inquiry to prevent the investigation and discovery of facts about his own actions or the actions of his staff. He is essentially a witness in the trial over which he is presiding. He has a conflict of interest because his testimony is relevant to the origins of the impeachment process that he is simultaneously conducting, directing, and managing.

If the Senate decides to allow witnesses during the trial, which is another contentious issue, the president’s defense team should be permitted to call Schiff as a witness and to question him about the circumstances behind the whistleblower complaint, his apparent inconsistent statements, his alleged conflict of interest, and his obvious bias.

While Schiff cannot avoid questioning by virtue of the fact that he is a prosecutor in the impeachment trial, his role as manager deserves a second look because of these various considerations. Finally, given his unwillingness to name the whistleblower and his staff members who initially spoke with the whistleblower, his testimony appears necessary, especially if nobody else can provide the needed information.

If this means he cannot serve as a manager, he should immediately step aside and allow the other managers to continue without him.

Biden Campaign Features Ukrainian Activist Who Previously Accused Hunter Biden Of Corruption,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign released a new video Tuesday night featuring a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who previously criticized Hunter Biden’s business in the country as “very bad.”

In campaign’s new video, rapid response director Andrew Bates intended to set the record straight “on what really happened” in Ukraine. Using archival news footage, the video included a short clip of Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre chastising Ukraine’s former Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Shokin as a corrupt government official who uses intimidation tactics in a “Soviet-system of prosecution.”

Take a seat, grab yourself a drink, and listen to our campaign’s Rapid Response Director @AndrewBatesNC explain what really happened in Ukraine. #TeamJoe pic.twitter.com/y82fcTGNvK — Team Joe (Text JOE to 30330) (@TeamJoe) January 21, 2020

Bates used Kaleniuk’s comments in the video to justify Joe Biden’s decision to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire Shokin by threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid to the European country.

“Joe Biden is the person who got him out of office,” Bates proudly declared. “It was a monumental, international, bipartisan, anti-corruption victory.”

Kaleniuk however, has also had some harsh words for the former vice president’s son, who served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma raking in $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while Joe Biden dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

“I think that Hunter Biden did a very bad thing,” Kaleniuk told ABC News last June. “He was very wrong. He allowed his name to be used.”

A Federalist analysis of the average board member compensation at comparable corporations found Hunter Biden was being paid far above marketable value. Board members working for Exxon Mobil for example, a company worth billions more than Burisma, reported earnings of little more than half what Hunter Biden was bringing in from Ukraine.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/22/biden-campaign-features-ukrainian-activist-who-previously-accused-hunter-biden-of-corruption/,2020-01-22
National Review’s Impeachment Advice To GOP Senators Is Deeply Naïve,"In an editorial published Wednesday at National Review, the editors argue that an “unspoken consensus” has emerged among Republican senators that what President Trump did was wrong but it doesn’t warrant his removal from office. The editors think this a “reasonable” position and that Republicans should make the case for it publicly, but they can’t because of the president’s “obstinacy” in defending his actions vis-à-vis Ukraine.

Instead of insisting that Trump “cannot be impeached for any abuse of power unless that abuse took the form of a criminal violation of a statute,” they write, “Republicans would be better off arguing that in this case the president’s behavior, while objectionable, should be left, as scheduled, to the judgment of the voters directly.”

My colleague David Marcus yesterday pointed out some serious problems with this argument, not least of which is that there is no evidence of an emerging unspoken consensus among GOP senators that what Trump did was objectionable—just the opposite, in fact, as the impeachment trial drags on.

But one aspect of Marcus’ argument deserves more fleshing out because it gets to the heart of the divisions on the right over Trump generally and impeachment specifically. He writes:

The notion that a Trump apology over his call, accompanied by grave-faced GOP officials decrying the act but begging that Trump be given a second chance, would have led to Democrats backing down on their impeachment push is pure fantasy. Just as Rep. Adam Schiff tried to do in his arguments yesterday, the Democrats would have seized on Trump’s admission of any flaw in his approach as just one in a chain of illegal acts they believe the president has committed.

For the sake of argument, let’s say that the editors of National Review (and full disclosure: over the years I’ve occasionally written for both NRO and the print magazine) are right about this unspoken consensus among Republicans. And let’s say they follow the editors’ advice and concede that Trump should never have asked Ukraine for an investigation into Burisma or the Bidens or possible 2016 election interference. They argue that this was very bad, very objectionable, but surely it doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment. Surely, we must leave this to the voters.

Let’s say they make that case. What do the editors think would be the outcome? Do they think it would persuade even one Senate Democrat to vote for acquittal? Do they think it would satiate Resistance Democrats who have been calling for Trump’s impeachment and removal since November 2016? Do they think it would endear Senate Republicans to Trump voters, who will see that, yes, these senators are indeed principled and serious people, and deserve our confidence and respect?

I should say, if the editors really believe what Trump did was wrong but he shouldn’t be impeached over it, fine. But to counsel GOP senators to engage this sort of argument as a political strategy against a Democratic Party marching in lock-step for impeachment is deeply naïve. After all, we’re talking about a Democratic Party that to date has voted four times on impeachment in the House, beginning with a vote in December 2017 on articles of impeachment for the high crime of criticizing NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem. Fifty-eight Democratic members of the House supported it.

A month later, 66 Democrats voted for impeachment after Trump’s “sh-thole countries” comment. In July of last year, 95 Democrats—more than 40 percent of House Democrats—voted to impeach Trump for tweeting that members of the Squad should “go back” to their home countries if they don’t like America. Clearly, a significant portion of House Democrats are not all that concerned about the reason for Trump’s impeachment, so long as he’s impeached.

Democrats Want to Destroy Trump ‘Thoroughly’

This of course has been their plan all along. When Democrats gained a majority in the House in the 2018 midterms, House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler was overheard on the Acela train from New York to Washington talking about how House Democrats were ready to go “all-in” on impeachment. This was the entire purpose of the Robert Mueller probe and the Russia collusion hoax, which turned out badly for Democrats when, after more than two years of investigating, Mueller turned up nothing.

Even before the Mueller probe, Democrats have been angling to destroy Trump. Four months before the 2016 election, President Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe wrote in a since-deleted tweet, “It is not enough to simply beat Trump. He must be destroyed thoroughly. His kind must not rise again.” Elaborating on this to a New York Times reporter, Plouffe said, “This could still be a relatively close race, but it’s more likely to be a blowout than a Trump win.” (Funnily enough, Plouffe has a book coming out in March called, “A Citizen’s Guide to Defeating Donald Trump.”)

The point is that Democrats are not interested in subtle arguments about what’s an impeachable offense and what isn’t. They aren’t even interested in basic details of their own case against the president, like whether there was a legitimate basis for Trump to ask for an investigation into a notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company. Did Trump ask President Zelensky of Ukraine for an investigation, or did he ask him to fabricate dirt on a political rival?

As National Review’s own Andrew McCarthy pointed out this week, Rep. Adam Schiff has from the start ignored that distinction, instead simply asserting that there was no legitimate reason for Trump’s request—as if his say-so should be enough to put the matter to rest and move forward with the removal of a duly elected president.

Only the most rabid partisan would find that convincing in the least—the sort of partisan who would take any admission by Senate Republicans of Trump’s wrongdoing as proof positive that he must be removed from office, niceties about what constitutes an impeachable offense be damned. As it happens, those are precisely the kind of partisans now in charge of the Democratic Party, and they won’t stop until Trump has been destroyed thoroughly.

Bolton Book Leak Happened The Same Day His Book Became Available For Pre-Order,"The New York Times published new impeachment claims by former National Security Advisor John Bolton from Bolton’s new book due in March on Sunday, the same day that Bolton’s book became available for pre-order.

The revelations from Bolton’s book, according to unpublished manuscripts reviewed by the New York Times, are Bolton accusing President Donald Trump of tying Ukraine military aid to political motivated investigations.

BREAKING: John Bolton's book, ""The Room Where it Happened,"" is tentatively slated for release on March 17. The Amazon page just went live https://t.co/dZ1AkZDQ7x — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 27, 2020

This is obviously book promo coordinated with compliant media, yes. But an additional word of skepticism: these *particular* folks have a pattern of overpromising and underachieving with their ""bombshell"" anti-Trump book roll outs. https://t.co/xid14bUvmG — Mollie (@MZHemingway) January 27, 2020

The Times reports that in the book, Bolton’s timeline of events last year show Trump wanting to continue withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to the European nation until Ukrainian officials pledged to investigate corruption related to the Biden family.

Bolton’s book reveals what the former national security advisor would have likely told Congress over the course of the impeachment proceedings and comes as the question over whether the Senate will call witnesses to offer new trial testimony remains open. Bolton has said he would comply with a Senate subpoena to testify in the impeachment trial if requested.

House Democrats rushed the impeachment investigations in the House last fall in an effort to force a full-chamber vote on the articles by Christmas, arguing that Trump was an urgent danger to the survival of American democracy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi then undercut the Democrats’ case for urgency by withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate for a trial to begin by more than four weeks.

Bolton’s new claims contradict testimony from multiple witnesses who appeared before the House arguing that the president wanted no quid pro quo with Ukraine over the military aid, which was ultimately released by congressional deadline.

A copy of Bolton’s book was provided to White House officials to vet the manuscript for classified information in a standard process by former government officials who write books. The timing of the manuscript’s leaked details to the New York Times to coincide with the book’s availability for pre-order online raises questions about the allegations’ credibility. Bolton’s team has denied being behind the leak, blaming the New York Times’ scoop on those working on the review process in the White House under the National Security Council’s Records Management Division.

“It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those involved in reviewing the manuscript,” Bolton attorney Charles Cooper said in a statement to the Associated Press.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/27/bolton-book-leak-happened-the-same-day-his-book-became-available-for-pre-order/,2020-01-27
Last-Second Impeachment Game-Playing Is Kavanaugh 2.0,"President Donald Trump’s opponents are using the same failed tactics to derail the president’s agenda for the crime of winning the 2016 election. On Sunday, The New York Times published leaked details of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s upcoming book accusing Trump of tying nearly $400 million in military aid to extracting politically motivated investigations into the Biden family.

Never mind that the book leak arrived on the same day that it became available for online pre-ordering, came unsubstantiated, and surfaced from a former White House aide with an axe to grind over his removal. The late leak is reminiscent of previous attempts to sabotage the Trump presidency with unfair operations pushing shady allegations via anonymous sources with no actual evidence paraded as “bombshells” in a compliant media.

The American people have now seen this kind of rollout happen throughout Trump’s time in the Oval Office. It happened with Russia, it happened with Ukraine, it happened with Brett Kavanaugh, and now it’s happening with impeachment.

Earlier this month, Washington Examiner Chief Political Correspondent Byron York predicted the precedent playing out after former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas took his turn trotting out new accusations of Trump’s alleged wrongdoing in the media.

From now until the trial is over, and perhaps beyond, Republicans expect Democrats to come up with some new something on a regular, if not daily, basis. GOP defenders are beginning to see the next month in the Senate not so much as an impeachment trial but as a replay of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings: a fait accompli that becomes a cliffhanger with new and progressively more spectacular allegations. None of them were true, but they threw Republicans on the defensive and plunged the confirmation into chaos for a while. For Democrats facing an uphill climb in a Republican-controlled Senate, why not try the same thing at the very highest level, an effort to remove the president?

That new “bombshell” evidence from Parnas proving an apparent quid pro quo between the president and Ukraine? An undated note repeating a claim made by a guy who has been indicted for fraud.

It’s also worth noting that Parnas is the guy who claimed House Intelligence Committee ranking Republican Devin Nunes of California met with Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin in Vienna in December 2018. Nunes, however, proved he was on a congressional trip to Malta and Libya meeting with government officials and has since filed a lawsuit against CNN for defamation after reporting that the meeting ever actually took place. Remember when Michael Cohen went to Prague?

It’s a formula that has become all-too-familiar over the course of Trump’s presidency. While it might seem like ages, it was only less than a year and a half ago that Democrats were playing the same game in an effort to disrupt Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination.

As it looked increasingly likely that Kavanaugh was on the path to successful confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate in fall 2018, Democrats brought forward uncorroborated and even contradicted allegations of sexual assault against the highly respected judge from more than 30 years ago.

Psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford was the first of several women to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, yet offered no proof that the two had even ever met. Ford was also unable to recall exactly where and when the alleged episode happened, and not one of the four alleged witnesses she named to the event supported Ford’s claims.

Three other women notably came forward with stories of sexual misconduct and were propped up as Me Too heroes in the media, including a former government employee name Julie Swetnick represented by Michael Avenatti, who is currently on trial for extortion.

Swetnick claimed Kavanaugh was operating a serial gang rape operation throughout the Maryland suburbs as a teenager. Judy Munro-Leighton later confessed to fabricating a rape story by Kavanaugh to Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris.

Of course, the American public failed to get behind the accusations and demand Kavanaugh’s nomination be revoked. Instead, the delay tactics backfired on Democrats, who paid an electoral price by losing Senate seats in states that were seen as prime pick-up opportunities to flip control of the Senate.

Now Trump’s opponents are repeating the mistakes of the past by delaying the impeachment process as long as they can to tarnish Trump’s reputation.

There is no chance Trump will be removed from office at the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial. Nancy Pelosi knows it, Chuck Schumer knows it, Mitch McConnell knows it, the White House knows it, and even the media knows it. In a desperate attempt to keep the impeachment process ongoing, and arguably to rig the Democratic primary for former Vice President Joe Biden by keeping rival senators off the campaign trail in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Speaker Pelosi went as far as to withhold the impeachment articles from the upper chamber for weeks after they were passed.

Assuming Bolton’s latest around of accusations in his book are true that Trump wanted Ukraine military aid tied to demands for investigations beneficial to U.S. interests, that’s hardly grounds for removal.

To begin, Trump never pressured Ukraine for a “favor” to investigate the Biden family in a bid to disrupt Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. While Democrats with the help of a complicit media have hyped a false narrative that Trump demanded Ukraine interfere in the next U.S. presidential election in a July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, an honest reading of the call’s transcript reveals no such arrangement.

The revelation from the transcript’s release show Trump urging Zelensky to weed out corruption in his own country and investigate Ukraine’s origins in promoting the Russian collusion conspiracy theory that did irreparable harm to the United States. Part of that corruption happens to center on Hunter Biden’s role serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company raking in $50,000 to $80,000 a month, despite no prior experience in the industry, while his father dictated U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine.

It’s hardly a bad thing to tie foreign assistance to actions that favor U.S. interests, let alone a “high crime and misdemeanor” worthy of an impeachable offense.

The last-minute Bolton book leaks should come at no surprise to Washington observers, and there will likely be more revelations of no substance to emerge this week as “bombshells” paraded in the press either this week or next as the Senate impeachment trial wraps up absent new witnesses.

On The Front Lines Of Ukraine's Travel To Impeachment,"The phone call to Ukraine’s president at the heart of Democrats’ attempt to remove the president from office did not happen in the void so many in the media portray. The sequence of events that led up to that call can be traced directly back to 2008 and, more loosely, 50 years earlier to the Cold War.

They are the culmination of a decade of unanswered, aggressive Russian foreign and military policy, during which Ukraine has been both victim and testing ground for Russian military operational concepts. From Iraq to Ukraine to the Pentagon, I personally witnessed different aspects of every crucial step of this drama — a drama born of the Russians’ desire to stop North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership expansion along its borders and to maintain strategic opposition to the West.

Iraq, August 2008

I led a U.S. Army team fighting in Sadr City during the 2008 surge in Iraq. Returning from a two-week leave in August, I watched as 2,000 Georgian soldiers lined the military airfield at Baghdad International Airport.

The Georgians had been called back to their home country in a massive, rapid airlift in response to the Russian invasion and eventual annexation of the Georgian states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, now known as the Russo-Georgian War. At the time, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili was a thorn in Vladimir Putin’s side. He held anti-Russian views and a decision on Georgia and Ukraine’s acceptance into NATO was pending a meeting in December 2008. This set off alarm bells in Moscow.

In mid-2008, Putin ordered the Russian military to invade and seize control of two of Georgia’s northern caucus states under the auspices of protecting from Georgian military aggression the Russian diaspora that lived there. Initially, Putin only sent several hundred unarmed troops into Abkhazia for “railway repairs.” After Georgian President Saakashvili sent armed troops into South Ossetia, Putin launched a full-scale invasion. The Kremlin intended to send a signal to other former Soviet satellite states that Russia would not tolerate NATO or Western influence on its borders, and that he was willing to use force to do it.

Five years later in 2013, it appeared the warning had been ignored. The consequences for Ukraine, the West, and more specifically, the United States, would be enormous.

In the years after the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, a pro-Western government emerged and the country was on the verge of signing the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement. In a November about-face, however, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych rejected the agreement in favor of economic assistance and closer political ties with Russia.

This did not sit well with Ukraine’s population, which had grown increasingly close to the West. Yanukovych’s decision ignited protests in the capital of Kiev and across the country.

Ukraine, Winter 2014

I arrived in Kiev in late January 2014 to find the main square of the capitol stacked with burning barrels, snow barriers, protest signs, and Ukrainians physically occupying the area to take a stand against Russia and the decision to abandon the agreement with the European Union.

As the revolution unfolded in Ukraine in late 2013, Russia needed to manufacture a reason to get control of the situation and build support for action with both domestic audiences and Russian sympathizers in Eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian military forces hadn’t acted against civilians and there was no legitimate reason under international norms for Russia to invade, so they manufactured a crisis to enable its strategic objectives.

With Putin’s blessing, the Russian military and intelligence services engaged in a widespread information operations campaign designed to convince the Russian people, sympathizers in Eastern Ukraine, and the broader world that anti-Russian Ukrainian fascists were targeting and killing ethnic Russians and their friends. Russian state television was packed with images of supposed attacks and actions against civilians in Ukraine that were by and large fabricated.

In early February 2014, I flew from Kiev to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that was a part of Poland before the Soviet Union invaded in 1939. The people there were fiercely pro-Ukrainian, and spoke Ukrainian instead of Russian, which is the primary language in eastern Ukraine and even Kiev. I arrived in a peaceful city with tourists roaming about, shopping and sightseeing. I witnessed firsthand that the Russian propaganda that had labeled Lviv a hub of anti-Russian fascist activity simply wasn’t true.

After establishing the false narrative, Putin ordered the Russian military to invade Ukraine, though they did so without wearing or displaying anything that identified them as Russian forces. They also seized control of Crimea to gain control of the strategically important Russian Naval Base in Sevastopol, which is home to Russia’s Black Fleet.

The Black Fleet is the pride of the Russian Navy and is used as a strategic force to counter the West, and NATO in particular. Only a few years earlier, Ukraine had threatened not to renew the lease, which would have left Russia without a warm-water naval port to access the Mediterranean.

In Ukraine, Russian Information Operations were the main effort, as opposed to a shaping operation designed to support major kinetic action. This is a major change in tactics. The Russians’ successful information operations campaign in Ukraine lead them to two conclusions that ultimately inspired their attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

First, Russia was capable of successfully executing information operations from inside Russia that target foreign adversaries to strategic ends. Second, Putin deduced that the United States was unlikely to respond to Russian information operations in the United States. In both cases, Putin was right.

The Pentagon, August 2014 – June 2015

In response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, Ukraine aggressively sought offensive weapon systems to halt the Russian advance and establish a deterrent for further Russian encroachment. From 2014 to 2015, I worked in the Office of the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon and watched as the Ukrainians used formal- and back-channels to lobby the Obama administration for offensive weapons. Ultimately, the administration decided against doing so out of fear of escalating the situation — another unwise policy decision that helped to reinforce Russia’s perception that they could get away with electoral interference in the coming years.

Enter: Hunter Biden. In spring 2014, just after the annexation of Crimea, the largest natural gas company in Ukraine, called Burisma Holdings, added Hunter Biden to its board of directors and paid him a handsome salary to improve the company’s reputation.

Hunter, an attorney, was largely unqualified for this role and was likely selected for no other reason than that his father, Joe Biden, was the sitting vice president of the United States at the time and the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Hunter admitted as much during an interview with ABC News, protesting that while he may have made a mistake, he did nothing wrong.

He also had a number of personal issues that made him a ripe target for foreign intelligence recruitment at a time when he had placement and access to the senior-most U.S. policy makers at the White House.

In 2016, a Ukrainian prosecutor who was tasked with investigating Burisma Holdings for corruption was fired by the Ukrainian government. He was widely viewed as corrupt himself and the incident would receive little attention until former Vice President Biden spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations event about the subject.

In describing an exchange he had with the then-Ukranian president and prime minister, Biden said, “I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

Biden had no idea his comments would lead to a theory that he had intervened to have the prosecutor fired to help a company paying his son Hunter. Eventually, allegations that the leading Democratic candidate for president may have been involved in a cover-up came up during President Donald Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president this past year, during a call in which the two leaders also talked about U.S. aid for Ukraine.

A whistleblower then came forward and alleged that the president’s request for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s actions in Ukraine was tied to U.S. aid, which served as the catalyst for Democrats in the House to attempt to remove him from office.

The United States and her Western allies have been engaged in reactive opposition to Russian actions across the globe for far too long. While modern-day Russia is a shadow of its former Soviet self, it is clear that Putin has become more emboldened and more brazen. The United States must re-establish the deterrence that has been lost over the past decade to prevent additional Russian attempts to undermine our democratic institutions and sow discord in our society.

Additionally, NATO must understand Russia’s opposition to membership expansion to former Soviet states along Russia’s borders and be prepared to deal with Russian aggression or deter it before it happens, or Russia will continue to think NATO weak and ineffective. Whether the alliance is capable or has the political will to do so is an entirely different question.

Joe Biden Claims His Son Got Burisma Job Because He's 'A Very Bright Guy',"During an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, former Vice President Joe Biden said his son Hunter Biden was asked to be a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma because he is “a very bright guy.”

“Do you think it was wrong for [Hunter] to take that position knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you?” Guthrie asked.

“Well that’s not true. You’re saying things you do not know what you’re talking about,” Biden responded.

Biden claimed his son got asked to be a board member of Burisma because he was a bright guy, not because his last name was Biden.

Joe Biden on why his son Hunter — who had no experience in Ukraine or in the energy sector — got an $80,000-per-month board seat with Burisma as father Biden was running US policy in Ukraine: ""Cause he's a very bright guy."" pic.twitter.com/2jOFbZQsre — Aaron Maté (@aaronjmate) February 3, 2020

In 2014, during his father’s time as vice president, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. He was paid upwards of $50,000 per month, a shockingly high salary for Hunter Biden’s non-existent experience in the energy sector.

In 2018, Joe Biden bragged about withholding aid from Ukraine until they fired their top prosecutor. At the time, this top prosecutor was investigating Burisma, the very company Hunter Biden was a board member of.

The Bidens’ perceived misconduct is at the heart of the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. In July 2019, Trump allegedly withheld Ukrainian military aid in hopes their government would launch an investigation into the Biden’s over potential malpractice in their previous dealings.

Since the inception of the impeachment trial, more allegations of misconduct against Hunter Biden have been discovered. The IRS went after Hunter Biden for evading income taxes up to $112,000. It was discovered his payout of $50,000 per month was far above comparable board positions and Hunter Biden also ran interference for a corrupt Romanian business tycoon.

In Monday’s “Today Show” interview, Joe Biden argued his son did nothing wrong and that it was merely the appearance of impropriety that was drawing media attention.

“No one’s found anything wrong with [Hunter’s] dealing with Ukraine, except they say it sets a bad image,” Biden said.

Hunter Biden was overly compensated for a position he was under qualified solely because of his last name. He evaded taxes and displayed a pattern of working with corrupt actors. For Joe Biden to negate these facts when running interference for his son is preposterous.

A winning argument for Joe Biden as he continues on the 2020 campaign trail is centered around admitting his son held the Burisma board position because of his last name. Joe Biden can claim his son did nothing wrong when working on the board, however, to insert the argument that Hunter Biden received his Burisma board position because he was “a very bright guy,” will not go far with primary voters who watch the questionable practices and patterns of Hunter Biden from afar.

5 Ways Impeachment Has Helped Trump And Hurt Democrats,"President Donald Trump has once again sidestepped the pit Democrats dug for him, leaving them to eat their own dirt. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment efforts, designed to hobble Trump for the 2020 election, has turned into a series of unexpected boons for the president and his party. Here are five of the most conspicuous ones.

1. Congress Passes Trump’s Biggest Bipartisan Trade Bill

Loath to give Trump a legislative win prior to a presidential election, Pelosi flexed her majority muscle to sideline the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), negotiated by the Trump administration to replace the much-maligned North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump lambasted NAFTA, the agreement credited with having opened the floodgates for offshoring American manufacturing. He promised to tear this “worst deal ever negotiated” and deliver the USMCA, designed to protect American jobs and workers.

Of course, Pelosi didn’t want to hand the president a win he could crow about, so she sat on the USMCA for a whole year and refused to bring it to a vote in the House despite bipartisan support. As Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry, the president and his GOP allies targeted the “do-nothing Democrats” as more invested in a partisan impeachment than in legislating for the good of the American people, pointing to the USMCA as a prime example.

This campaign hit a nerve among vulnerable members of Pelosi’s caucus in districts Trump won heavily, so she quickly called a vote on the USMCA to deflect the relentless criticism and provide these vulnerable Democrats something to show their constituents for the House seats they won in 2018.

2. Polls Move in Trump’s Favor

Prior to the start of the impeachment inquiry, all the top Democratic primary candidates were leading Trump by as much as double digits in the polls. Every one was projected to beat the president in a head-to-head match, including then-fourth-place Elizabeth Warren, needled by the president as Pocahontas for her bogus claim to Native American ancestry.

An August 2019 Fox News general election poll showed Joe Biden at 50 percent against Trump at 38 percent. It also showed Trump at 39 percent against Bernie Sanders at 48, Kamala Harris at 45, and Elizabeth Warren at 45.

The latest Fox News poll shows a tightening, with Biden at 50 to Trump at 41, Sanders at 48 to Trump at 42, Warren at 47 to Trump at 42, and Buttigieg at 45 to Trump at 41. During impeachment, Trump has been gaining on every leading Democrat opponent.

The most telling impeachment effect on polls is occurring in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Here the president beats all the leading Democratic contenders. The Firehouse/Optimus poll puts Trump ahead of Biden, Sanders, Warren, and Buttigieg by significant margins.

RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of polls shows the president hitting his highest job approval rating since his inauguration at 45.6 percent, the best it’s been in three years.

3. Biden Wobbles, Sanders Surges

The conflict of interest involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter is perhaps the sharpest double-edged sword to emerge out of the impeachment saga. In an overzealous effort to get President Trump, Democrats have effectively sacrificed their front-runner. Trump and the GOP have successfully launched a impeachment counter-narrative, aiming their firepower at the Bidens and possible money dealings with Burisma, a Ukraine-based energy company.

Pelosi’s head-scratching move to hold up the articles of impeachment for four weeks after the Democrats impeached Trump had many Washington wags talking about how this was a tactic to help Democrat front-runner Joe Biden. They calculated that forcing the Senate trial close to the Iowa caucuses would unduly advantage Biden, who could continue campaigning while his senator rivals such as Sanders, Warren, and Amy Klobuchar were stuck at the Senate impeachment trial.

If there ever were a mother of boomerangs, let’s just say this is a close kin. Biden’s front-runner trajectory is shaky while Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is littered with Hillaryish operatives re-rigging the rules for maximum obstruction, a sure sign the party bosses fear Sanders could become their nominee and unleash the nightmarish certitude of Trump’s re-election.

4. A United GOP

“Do not doubt me on this,” said the self-proclaimed God’s-gift-to-broadcasting Rush Limbaugh when he declared that the GOP has never been more united than it is now. “I have never seen this before,” the radio host barked to his millions of listeners.

Grassroots conservatives have often felt consternation at spineless Republicans, who frequently bend to the will of Democrats and the vociferous media. But not this time. The impeachment defense mounted by the House GOP was not spineless. Led by the likes of Reps. Devin Nunez, Jim Jordan, John Ratcliffe, and others, they forced admission from witness after witness that not one had any direct knowledge of crimes the Democrats accuse Trump of committing.

During the House’s final vote to impeach, there was not one defection from the GOP despite the usual media intimidation that, in the past, would have been enough to pry loose the weakest link. In fact, it was the other way around. A couple Democrats voted with the GOP, and one actually broke ranks with the Democratic Party to become a Republican.

In the Senate, notwithstanding Sens. Susan Collins and Mitt Romney’s desertion on additional witnesses, every amendment introduced by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gained no Republican support, and the cool divide between Republicans and Democrats stood at a stony 53-47 in vote after vote. The certain acquittal of Trump come Wednesday’s final impeachment vote may even see Democratic defections to the GOP side.

5. The Deep State May Face Criminal Inquiry

When the president’s defense team presented their evidentiary argument to counter Democrats’ articles of impeachment, they took time to lay out that the Democrats conveniently neglected to mention one exculpatory fact after another from their body of evidence amassed during the House hearings. Why?

Like a running gag in a movie, the president’s defense lawyers kept asking this question. In addition to credibly questioning the validity of the House managers’ allegations that the president committed impeachable acts, the repeat whys were more than enough to suggest something far more sinister was afoot and more than enough to stoke the fires of a conspiracy theory evolving in conservative media outlets.

Even Twitter is not immune. Tweets about the supposed whistleblower, complete with an identifying name and picture, draw links to the Robert Mueller investigation and to the office and staff of Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager.

The crumb line seems to suggest that Pelosi’s impeachment of Trump was but a continuing effort to overthrow this president and disenfranchise the votes of millions of Americans going all the way back to Crossfire Hurricane, the high-level FBI investigation that conducted wiretapping or FISA surveillance on the 2016 Trump campaign through Carter Page. If proven, the president may very well have a counter-offensive in his hands against his detractors, which could actually land some of them behind bars.

Consider Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s testimony in the House hearings. He testified that after hearing the conversation between Trump and the president of Ukraine, he told another intelligence officer not formally part of the National Security Council Vindman is on. Is the whistleblower the person Vindman spoke to? The GOP initiated this line of questioning during the House hearings, but Schiff immediately shut it down.

Was this a leak of classified information to someone who may not have had the appropriate level of security clearance? Was this a crime under national security laws? If true, as reported, that Vindman has ties to John Brennan, former CIA chief and fierce critic of the president, would it be inconceivable to think that Brennan may have his hand in this as well?

If this thread in any way links to Crossfire Hurricane and to the origins of the Trump investigation over Russian collusion, then U.S. Attorney John Durham’s scope of investigation may have just widened.

Senator Susan Collins To Vote For Trump's Acquittal On Both Counts,"Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announced Tuesday she would be voting to acquit President Donald Trump on both accounts of “abuse of power,” and “obstruction of Congress,” in the final impeachment vote Wednesday.

She characterized Trump’s actions last year related to Ukraine “flawed,” but said she would reject removal from office as the House failed to prove that the president’s conduct was proper grounds for impeachment.

“I do not believe the House has met its burden that the president’s conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office,” Collins said on the Senate floor. “This decision is not about whether you like or dislike this president, or agree with or oppose his policies or approve or disapprove of his conduct in other circumstances. Rather it is about whether the charges meet the very high constitutional standard of treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors.”

Collins, a swing vote on the issue broke with Republicans on Friday with Utah Senator Mitt Romney by joining Democrats in voting to subpoena new witnesses to testify before the upper chamber which would extend the proceedings.

In announcing her decision to vote for acquittal, Collins referenced her vote to acquit President Bill Clinton in 1999 to argue consistency in her position that even if misbehavior is proven in office, it does not always hit the high bar required for removal.

“In the trial of President Clinton, I argued that in order to convict, we must conclude from the evidence presented to us with no room for doubt that our Constitution will be injured and our democracy suffer should the president remain in office one moment more,” Collins noted. “The House managers adopted a similar threshold when they argued that President Trump’s conduct is so dangerous that he must not remain in power one moment longer.”

Collins added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to stall the Senate trial undercut Democrats’ claims that Trump was an urgent danger to the republic. Collins also argued that Democrats’ charge for “abuser of power,” “does not even attempt to assert that the president committed a crime.”

“While I do not believe that the conviction of a president requires a criminal act, the high bar for removal from office is perhaps even higher when the impeachment is for a difficult-to-define noncriminal act,” Collins said.

As to the charge for “obstruction of Congress,” Collins labeled it a “dispute over witnesses and documents between legislative and executive branches,” and said it did not meet the standard of a high crime and misdemeanor.

“An objection or privilege asserted by one party cannot be deemed invalid, let alone impeachable, simply because the opposing party disagrees with it,” Collins said.

The moderate Maine senator’s decision Tuesday comes amid questions of not how many Republicans will not flip to join Democrats on the impeachment vote Wednesday but how many Democrats will join Republicans.

Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin raised speculation Monday that he might vote to acquit Trump when he began urging lawmakers to censure Trump over the president’s dealings with Ukraine rather than impeach, noting that the country has never seen a purely partisan impeachment in its more than 200 year history.

“Removing this president at this time would not only further divide our deeply divided nation, but also further poison our already-toxic political atmosphere,” Manchin argued.

Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another swing vote in the Senate also announced Monday night that should would not vote to convict Trump based on the evidence before Congress. Murkowski asserted that the voters will decide whether to keep Trump in office in just nine months.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/04/gop-swing-vote-sen-susan-collins-to-vote-for-trumps-acquittal-on-both-impeachment-charges/,2020-02-04
Impeachment Theater Could Not Have Gone Worse For Democrats,"Democrats’ impeachment effort was never about removing President Donald Trump from office. If it had been, it would not have been rushed through the House of Representatives without a proper predicate or investigation.

No reasonable person expected the Republican-controlled Senate to remove a sitting president for anything Rep. Adam Schiff repeatedly alleged, no matter how unfairly he characterized Trump’s thoughts, words, or actions.

Impeachment was about satisfying the corporate media and Democratic base that had demanded it for years. And since removal was never a realistic outcome, it was about harming Trump in an election year.

By that standard, it could not have gone worse. Here are three ways that Pelosi’s gambit backfired bigly.

1. Donald Trump’s Numbers Went Up, Not Down

The latest Gallup poll of registered voters shows that Trump’s approval rating is the highest it’s been since his inauguration — 49 percent. That number went up from 39 percent in October, which was during the House’s impeachment process, such as it was.

During that same time, approval of the Democratic Party fell from 48 percent to 45 percent and approval of the Republican Party shot up from 43 percent to 51 percent. That’s the first time the GOP has had majority approval since 2005. The party also has a rare partisan-ID advantage.

Approval for Trump’s handling of the economy and the killing of terrorists have strong majorities as well. More than half of those polled favor his acquittal, economic confidence is the highest it’s been in decades, and national confidence is at a 15-year high. The Gallup poll matches other recent surveys showing Trump with high marks.

The entire point of impeachment was to push Trump’s numbers down. They went up. They went up despite media push polls trying to suggest, however implausibly, that a legitimate majority of Americans wanted Trump removed from office. Trump’s numbers went up despite overwhelmingly favorable coverage of the slipshod impeachment case.

This is a huge disaster for Democrats.

2. Joe Biden’s Candidacy Was Irreparably Harmed By Impeachment Facts

When the Russia collusion hoax imploded finally with the July 2019 testimony of Robert Mueller, the man ostensibly in charge of the special counsel probe into the matter, Democrats had to scramble for another reason to push impeachment. With the help of an anonymous whistleblower — reported to be a partisan ally of Joe Biden’s from his time as President Barack Obama’s point man over Ukraine — Democrats concocted an elaborate scheme to accuse President Trump of abuse of power related to Ukraine.

The original claim was that President Trump had committed a campaign finance violation for asking for assistance with a government investigation into Ukraine’s known 2016 election meddling and for Ukraine to look into corruption issues related to the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. His son Hunter Biden had received a lucrative $80,000-a-month gig to sit on the board of a reportedly corrupt energy concern. Biden had no relevant experience for the position apart from being the son of the man handling Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

Democrats alleged that the concerns President Trump expressed amounted to 2020 election interference requiring immediate removal from office. But no one ever offered a non-corrupt explanation for the Biden family’s lucrative entanglement in Ukraine, making the argument much more difficult.

Joe Biden just underperformed in the Iowa caucuses. He is a two-time vice president who had the entire Democratic Party establishment behind him. Because of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s antics in delaying the delivery of the articles of impeachment to the Senate, he had more or less free run over the state for the last two weeks while serious opponents Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar were forced to remain in Washington for the impeachment trial.

Yet reports indicate Biden underperformed, perhaps even getting boat-raced by a Communist-country-loving Democratic socialist, a Pretendian, and a child mayor. New York Times podcaster Michael Barbaro reported of an instance where the unanswered facts about Hunter Biden hurt his father’s performance:

The Biden supporter pushes back by asking if the Yang supporter has fact-checked that statement, which she says she has. But fairly or not, it suggests that the Ukraine stuff may have dented Biden’s primary appeal of clear electability. — Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) February 4, 2020

Of course, a fact check would have meant the Yang supporter underestimated the level of remuneration by nearly $1 million a year, but the anecdote does suggest that the entire impeachment effort only highlighted a corruption that would never have been mentioned by corporate media otherwise.

It is worth remembering that the only reason we even know that President Trump discussed these matters is because of a leak to Politico — presumably by people close to impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff — in late August. Otherwise, Biden would not have been tarnished by these claims that the media had graciously left underreported prior to the impeachment gambit.

2020 election interference, indeed!

3. Republicans Were Accidentally Forced Into Their Position of Maximal Strength

Republicans perform best when they are unified, but it’s surprisingly difficult to get them there. During the 2016 election, for example, many Republican leaders succumbed to peer pressure and media pressure to denounce Trump. Those who did faced electoral consequences, even if they received restrained praise from the media.

In the early days of the Trump administration, Republican senators were some of Trump’s biggest opponents. Many privately discussed with reporters their willingness and even eagerness to vote to remove him from office at the end of the Russia investigation. Instead of investigating the false and dangerous Russia collusion theory, most Republican senators sat quietly or supported the limitless investigation into him and his associates.

Only the utter failure of that probe to find any collusion with Russia protected Trump from intra-party revolt.

But when Democrats’ impeachment effort failed to meet even basic standards of fairness or seriousness, Republican senators, even those who loathe Trump, could not justify a vote to remove him. Their voters would have never tolerated it even if they had wanted to. The case was so weak and so shoddy that voting to acquit was far and away the easiest choice to make.

As with the anti-Kavanaugh smear operation, things turned in Republicans’ favor and against Democrats, and the media only when they showed unity in the face of the coordinated campaign.

The unfairness of that operation also made Republican senators wake up to the need to fight back and fight hard. Voters now demand a strength in their senators that they were previously able to avoid showing. This is the position of maximum strength for Republicans, and was only made possible by how poor the Democratic operation was.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/05/impeachment-theater-could-not-have-gone-worse-for-democrats/,2020-02-05
Senate Majority Acquits Trump On All Impeachment Charges,"The partisan operation to oust Trump through impeachment for winning the 2016 presidential election finally came to an end Wednesday with Trump’s acquittal in the Senate.

The Senate voted to acquit Trump on the first article of impeachment, a charge for abuse of power, with a vote of 52-48, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. They voted to acquit on the second article of impeachment, a charge of obstruction of justice, with a vote of 53-47.

Sen. Mitt Romney announced just hours before he would break party lines and split his vote, voting Trump guilty on the abuse of power charge, but not guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.

After the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered remarks on the Senate floor, reminding senators of the importance of America’s institutions, and warning them of the political threats against such institutions including the Electoral College, the judiciary, and the Senate.

“We simply cannot let factional fever break our institutions. It must work the other way, as Madison and Hamilton intended. The institutions must break the fever, rather than the other way around,” he said. “The Framers built the Senate to keep temporary rage from doing permanent damage to our Republic.”

The official proceedings were kicked off last fall by an anonymous whistleblower complaint alleging Trump conspired with the Ukrainian president to interfere in the next U.S. presidential election this November.

The complaint, marked both “credible” and “urgent” by the intelligence community inspector general but not by the Department of National Intelligence sparked new life into the top item on the Democratic policy agenda: the impeachment of President Trump following the spectacular collapse of the grand Russian collusion conspiracy theory last spring.

The whistleblower’s complaint centered on a July 25th phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky where Trump allegedly pressured the Ukrainian president to launch politically motivated investigations into the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in withheld military aid in an apparent quid pro quo.

Nevermind that the aid was released by the congressionally mandated deadline without the investigations that Democrats and a compliant media have charged Trump with demanding, an unredacted transcript of the call was declassified and released to the public in an unprecedented move to release the conversartion in plain sight revealing no such arrangement between the two world leaders.

The grand reveal from the transcript’s release? That Trump requested a foreign power with a reputation as one of the world’s most corrupt governments root out the corruption plaguing its country, a common practice among American presidents. The president also requested that the Ukrainian leader investigate the origins of Ukraine’s peddling of the Russia hoax in the United States which did irreparable harm to the country. That’s the “high crime and misdemeanor,” that Democrats pinned their impeachment.

Part of that corruption centered on former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma raking in upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while his father dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

A Federalist analysis of board member compensation at comparable companies revealed that Hunter Biden was being showered with excess compensation, where board members on companies exponentially larger than Burisma only earned little more than half of Hunter Biden’s pay.

After roughly a month and a half of a secret impeachment investigation run behind closed doors by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, the House voted along party lines to formally open up an impeachment inquiry on Halloween, with two Democrats joining Republicans in opposition.

House Democrats then rushed the process to reach a full chamber vote on two articles of impeachment by Christmas. One article was passed for “abuse of power” and one for “obstruction of Congress,” neither of which were rooted in law following a few weeks of hearings featuring 17 Democrat-called witnesses whose testimony either exonerated the president or destroyed their own credibility.

Immediately after passage of the articles, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would be withholding the articles from the Senate for a trial to begin until she extracted concessions from Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky on how the trial would be conducted.

Pelosi, after her Democratic colleagues in the House failed to find incriminating evidence against the president sought to put pressure on Senate Republicans to commit to calling new witnesses to testify as public opinion went underwater on impeachment.

The House speaker however, had no leverage to work with and caved after four weeks of withholding thee articles and transmitted them to the upper chamber without a single concession from Republican senators.

Public support for removing the president meanwhile, continued to sink as Pelosi undercut the Democrats’ case that Trump was an urgent danger to the republic who must be removed from the Oval Office.

When the Senate trial got underway, most Americans refused to pay much attention, as the trial got worse ratings than television soap operas.

Similar to the way the Kavanaugh proceedings played out just less than a year and a half ago, 11th- hour revelations of wrongdoing against the president emerged precisely as the Senate prepared to vote on whether to call for new witnesses. The new evidence however, surfaced in unsubstantiated claims from Giuliani associate Lev Parnas who has been indicted for fraud and former National Security Advisor John Bolton who was fired from the White House last year.

In the midst of the Senate trial, manuscripts from Bolton’s unpublished book got leaked to the New York Times alleging that Trump tied the almost $400 million in aid to the investigations into the Biden family on the same day that Bolton’s book became available for pre-sale.

Regardless, the new unproven claims from Bolton convinced two Republican senators, Mitt Romney from Utah and Susan Collins of Maine to join Democrats in voting for new witnesses to come forward and extend the proceedings on Friday. The measure failed however, leading to the Trump’s acquittal on Wednesday.

Despite months of Democrats trying to bring down the president, Trump reached his highest approval rating on Tuesday hours before his third State of the Union address with 49 percent of Americans approving of the president’s job performance.

"Sens. Grassley, Johnson Request Hunter Biden Travel Records","Two top Republican senators requested Hunter Biden’s official travel records Wednesday from the Secret Service in the latest move of their ongoing investigation into Biden’s conflicts of interest.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who leads the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, penned a letter to the Secret Service to learn whether Biden “used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business” stemming from his work with overseas nations.

The committees, the senators wrote, is “reviewing potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration, particularly with respect to his business activities in Ukraine and China.”

In 2013, Biden flew aboard Air-Force Two with his father Vice President Joe Biden to China and arranged meetings with Chinese businessmen. Soon after, a series of transactions followed that benefited Hunter Biden’s firm, BHR. Hunter Biden also served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, raking in upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while his father dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president.

A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much Biden was being showered in excess compensation. According to Reuters, Burisma reported $400 million in revenues in 2018, while Exxon Mobil reported earnings of $20.8 billion. Board members for Exxon Mobil, however, earned little more than half what Biden was bringing in from Burisma.

Grassley and Johnson have requested the Secret Service to:

1. Please describe the protective detail that Hunter Biden received while his father was Vice President. 2. Please provide a list of all dates and locations of travel, international and domestic, for Hunter Biden while he received a protective detail. In your response, please note whether his travel was on Air Force One or Two, or other government aircraft, as applicable and whether additional family members were present for each trip.

The letter comes on the same day President Donald Trump was acquitted on both impeachment counts passed by the House in December charging Trump with “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress.”

House Democrats accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate corruption related to the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in withheld military aid in an alleged quid pro quo. The aid, however, was ultimately released to the eastern European nation by the congressionally mandated deadline without a single investigation in Ukraine that the president allegedly demanded.

The Senate voted to acquit Trump on the “abuse of power” charge 52-48 and “obstruction of Congress,” 53-47. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was the only Republican to cross party lines and vote to convict Trump on abuse of power. Democrats needed 67 votes, a two-thirds majority, to remove Trump from office.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/06/sens-grassley-johnson-request-hunter-biden-travel-records/,2020-02-06
Why Trump Was Absolutely Right To Boot Alex Vindman,"Barely a day passed after the president’s acquittal in the Senate before he took action to transfer three figures connected with the effort to oust him. President Trump directed the transfer of both Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother Yevgeny Vindman from the National Security Council. He also directed the recall of Ambassador Gordon Sondland.

The president had a duty to make these changes to ensure the integrity of our system of self-government the same way presidents have immediately acted to expel past administration officials who used their posts to undermine and criticize the policies of the elected president.

10 U.S.C. 888, Article 88 makes it a crime for a commissioned officer to use contemptuous words against the president. The importance of this law can be traced back to the destruction of representative democracy in Rome, when the man who would be later crowned Julius Caesar used his military post to delegitimize and neuter the Roman Senate.

Roman law specified that only elected magistrates (consuls and praetors) could command armies within Italy. Any unelected commander who led forces within striking distance of Rome itself (by crossing the boundary set at the Rubicon River) would be considered a traitor.

The founding fathers similarly demanded the military submit to its elected leader. Article II, Section 2 provides that “The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.” The founders feared a military that answered only to itself. To preserve self-government, the military must subordinate to elections. That means upholding the primacy of civilian control over the military.

Vindman is not a whistleblower. He’s an officer who attempted to usurp presidential leadership on Ukraine policy. He did not identify a rule, law, or regulation that the president violated. He was unable to identify any “crime” he thought the president might have committed. Vindman held a strong opinion that what the president did was “wrong” under Vindman’s conception of proper U.S. foreign policy.

“My core function is to coordinate U.S. government policy,” Vindman testified. That’s wrong. The president is the focal point of all foreign policy.

Perhaps the next president might seek Vindman’s policy expertise regarding Ukraine. But this president does not agree with Vindman’s conception of policy. Further, Vindman couldn’t content himself with registering a confidential objection to the president’s legal actions. He put on his military uniform to criticize the president’s policies to another branch of government. Vindman crossed the Rubicon, and he should not be allowed to do it again.

Many Americans do not agree with Vindman’s belief that the Bidens should be immune from inquiry. I want to abolish the two-tiered justice system that protects powerful people from the same laws under which the rest of us live. The Bidens should be investigated. That might offend the swamp. But there are legitimate swamp-draining reasons for asking about the Bidens.

Maybe Vindman can run for president to set different policy goals. But until then, Vidman should not be allowed to abuse his sensitive advisory position to thwart and criticize the president’s policies. He’s free to exercise his freedom of speech criticizing the president, but not as a military officer. Vindman hasn’t been “fired,” as the talking heads misleadingly report. He was transferred out of the sensitive National Security Council because he’s proven that he cannot be trusted to provide confidential advice to the president.

The voters, not Vindman, should have ultimate control over U.S. policy towards Ukraine. The golden thread connecting the ballot box to Ukraine policy passes through the president. Vindman’s attempt to break free of that control is counter to the Constitution and he should not be left in a position to do it again.

The president’s actions are consistent with historical precedent. For example, President Lincoln feared the impetuousness of his generals. He wrote to Gen. Joseph Hooker, “I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which, I am not quite satisfied with you. …you have taken counsel of your ambition…What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship…I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the Army of criticizing their Commander, and withholding confidence from him….”

We can also recall the examples of Gen. Douglas MacArthur defying President Truman and Gen. Stanley McChrystal criticizing President Obama. We can add to the list generals fired for criticizing President Clinton. The president, and through him the voters, are in charge of American foreign policy. That principle must be jealously guarded.

Whether they admit it or not, future Democrat presidents will benefit from this president’s bold action to protect the supremacy of civilian control over the military. All countries have elections. In most countries, however, those elections do not change power. For elections to matter, the elected leaders must be allowed to wield control; men like Vindman must be shown the door.

YouTube Removes Video Of Rand Paul Naming Alleged Whistleblower,"YouTube removed a video clip of Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul reading the question Chief Justice John Roberts suppressed during the Senate impeachment trial naming Eric Ciaramella, a man identified as the whistleblower by Real Clear Investigations.

“It is a chilling and disturbing day in America when giant web companies such as YouTube decide to censure speech,” Paul told Politico, which first reported the story. “Now, even protected speech, such as that of a senator on the Senate floor, can be blocked from getting to the American people. This is dangerous and politically biased. Nowhere in my speech did I accuse anyone of being a whistleblower, nor do I know the whistleblower’s identity.”

YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said in a statement to Politico that YouTube has routinely taken down videos that name the alleged whistleblower ruling it in violation of its standards.

“Videos, comments, and other forms of content that mention the leaked whistleblower’s name violate YouTube’s Community Guidelines and will be removed from YouTube,” Choi said. “We’ve removed hundreds of videos and over ten thousand comments that contained the name. Video uploaders have the option to edit their videos and exclude the name and reupload.”

Paul read the name of the alleged whistleblower out loud on the Senate floor who has been identified as Eric Ciaramella by Real Clear Investigations but not independently verified by The Federalist after Roberts twice refused to allow Paul pose the question to the House impeachment managers during the Senate trial.

Here’s what Paul said from the floor of the Senate on the day before President Donald Trump’s final impeachment vote:

My exact question was: are you aware that House intelligence committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella while at the National Security Council together, and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the president before there were formal House impeachment proceedings.

This is a based Rand Paul speech that everyone needs to see

Ukrainian President Zelensky Calls Impeachment A TV Soap Opera,"In a wide-ranging interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to the impeachment of President Donald Trump as a television series, specifically citing the soap operas “Santa Barbara” and “Dallas.” Throwing cold water on what Democrats alleged to be a pressure campaign on Zelensky and his government, the Ukrainian president also said he looks forward to his next conversation with Trump and hopes to visit the White House.

Zelensky did bristle when asked about corruption in Ukraine, asking President Trump to stop referring to his country as one of the most corrupt in the world. But he did acknowledge that in the past, Ukraine has suffered under great government corruption. He promised his administration is changing that and operating openly and honestly.

The interview severely undermines the entire premise of the Trump impeachment effort. Why on earth would Zelensky look forward to further conversations with Trump if the latter was, in Democrats’ words, extorting him in their July 25 phone call?

According to the Democrats and their allies in the media, Zelensky has been lying when he says he felt no pressure from President Trump to launch investigations into the energy company Burisma tied to Joe Biden’s son Hunter. The entire impeachment effort was based on the notion that Trump was dangling military aid to Ukraine until such an investigation was announced. But no investigation was announced, and the aid flowed before its deadline.

Further, while the Obama administration sat on its hands when Russia invaded Ukraine and only managed to send non-lethal aid such as blankets, the Trump administration has given significant lethal aid in an effort to thwart Russia’s military advances. Clearly, Zelensky is interested in further cultivating this relationship with Trump and the United States.

Aside from the fact that Zelensky, a former comedian, should upgrade his cable package, as he’s watching TV shows from the early 1980s, his dismissive view of the impeachment debacle is telling. One gets the sense from his remarks that he feels Democrats have been using him and his country to further attacks on Trump’s presidency when those same Democrats should be focused on helping his country defend itself from Russian aggression.

Just over a week after Trump’s acquittal in the Senate, this interview further cements the fact that impeachment was a cynical political ploy, not a serious investigation into an alleged abuse of power in which the person allegedly being bribed didn’t even know any bribery was happening.

The soap opera is over, and it is obvious Zelensky wants no reboot of it. Nobody shot JR. What the Ukrainian president wants and what we should all want is to put this sham impeachment behind us and to move forward with a meaningful and productive relationship with our ally. Hopefully now, that is exactly what will happen.

Hunter Biden Served On Board Of Coalition Pushing For Aid To Ukraine,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who is at the center of controversy surrounding conflicts of interest related to Ukraine, served on the board of a trade coalition that lobbied the Obama administration for additional aid to the eastern European country, according to the Daily Caller.

Hunter Biden worked from 2012 to 2018 on the board of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC), which pushed for increased spending and assistance to Ukraine, while his father dictated U.S. policy toward the former Soviet nation.

Hunter Biden’s technical role was director of the Center for U.S. Global Leadership. Its firm, Rosemont Seneca, made up a part of the coalition.

While on the board of the USGLC, Hunter Biden was also recruited by one of the country’s most notoriously corrupt energy companies, Burisma, for upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry in 2014. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much he was being showered with excess compensation from Ukrainian elites seeking White House access. For example, executives on the board of Exxon Mobil, a company worth billions more than Burisma, only pay its members little more than half of what Hunter Biden was raking in.

In February 2014, Joe Biden played a role in securing additional aid to Ukraine following the ouster of Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych. Two years later, with Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma and the USGLC, Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billon in assistance to Ukraine, provided by legislation for which the trade coalition had lobbied.

Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine have come under heightened scrutiny in recent months after the failed impeachment coup launched against President Donald Trump brought the Bidens’ interactions with Ukraine into the spotlight.

Weeks after Trump’s exoneration in the Senate, two top Republican senators have pivoted their focus on Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine, conducting a probe of the perceived conflicts of interest. Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who chairs the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Finance Committee, have formally requested records from federal agencies as part of their ongoing probe. Earlier this month, the Treasury Department confirmed the presence of Suspicious Activity Reports filed in relation to Hunter Biden’s overseas work.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/18/hunter-biden-served-on-board-of-trade-coalition-pushing-for-more-aid-to-ukraine/,2020-02-18
John Bolton Admits Last-Minute Impeachment Leak Was A Publicity Stunt,"Former National Security Advisor John Bolton admitted Wednesday that his testimony in President Donald Trump’s recent impeachment proceedings involving Ukraine would have had no impact on the trial’s outcome even after sections of his upcoming book leaked attempting to convict the president in its final days.

“People can argue about what I should have said and what I should have done,” Bolton said at Vanderbilt University Wednesday night during a forum with his predecessor Susan Rice, according to ABC News. “I will bet you a dollar right here and now my testimony would have made no difference to the ultimate outcome.”

“I sleep at night because I have followed my conscience,” Bolton added.

Rice challenged Bolton’s decision to remain silent throughout the process despite not ever being subpoenaed by the House or Senate in the proceedings.

“It’s inconceivable to me that if I had firsthand knowledge of a gross abuse of presidential power, that I would withhold my testimony,” Rice said. “I would feel like I was shamefully violating my oath that I took to support and defend the Constitution.”

Bolton argued that the House botched the process and condemned House Democrats for having committed “impeachment malpractice.”

“The process drove Republicans who might have voted for impeachment away from the president because it was so partisan,” Bolton claimed.

Bolton’s new book, “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” is slated to be released next month is expected to reveal what Bolton might have said had he been forced to testify before lawmakers in the impeachment proceedings. Republicans in the Senate defeated Democrats’ efforts to bring Bolton before the upper chamber before the final vote with only Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine voting in favor of the measure.

In the final days of the trial however, sections of Bolton’s upcoming book were leaked to the New York Times, featuring Bolton accusing Trump of tying the nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine with politically motivated investigations as Democrats alleged. The leak happened to come on the same day the book became available for online pre-order revealing the move as nothing more than a publicity stunt.

On Monday, Bolton accused the White House of trying to suppress details in the book in his first public remarks since the president’s exoneration at Duke University.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/20/john-bolton-admits-last-minute-impeachment-leak-was-a-publicity-stunt/,2020-02-20
The ‘Russia Is Stealing The Election For Trump’ Craze Is Back For 2020,"Like a particularly obstinate toe eczema, or a risible sequel of the Star Wars franchise, the Russia hysteria is back, just in time to poison the well before the elections. A new article (written by four reporters, no less!) for The New York Times claims that five unidentified “intelligence officials” apparently warned that the Russians were interfering to get President Trump re-elected.

This ostensibly made President Trump unhappy. He then rightfully complained that the matter was leaked, as it would be used against him. This came a couple of days after Richard Grenell, the pugilistic former U.S. ambassador to Germany, was appointed as acting director of national intelligence. Naturally, Twitter exploded.

The report states that five unidentified intelligence officials headed by election czar Shelby Pierson, who has been harshly critical of Moscow, briefed lawmakers on the charge that Moscow is interfering in the 2020 election, with the particular aim of re-electing Trump.

I am not privy to the raw data dump, but this type of deterministic prediction is very unlikely in intelligence circles, something even the intelligence guys in the NYT article seemed to agree on: “Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying the conclusions could have been delivered in a less pointed manner or left out entirely to avoid angering Republicans. The intelligence official who delivered the briefing, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire and has a reputation for speaking bluntly.”

This took a more urgent turn after Grenell was appointed DNI. Grenell has acquired somewhat a reputation of an imperial viceroy due to his hard-nosed realpolitik in Europe as the ambassador to Germany. He was instrumental in a $100-billion increase for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s budget since Trump came to power, critical of increasing German- Russian gas pipelines, and the force behind selling weapons to Ukraine to deter Russia.

His appointment absurdly started a panic in the left Twittersphere. John Brennan, the disgraced former CIA director under Obama, said the appointment means America is under a full-blown national security crisis, while Michael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Moscow under Obama and the architect of the failed Russian reset, hinted in a sinister tone that there’s nothing more dangerous than politicizing intelligence. More regular offenders butted in with no sense of irony.

The story has since reached a level of absurdity that eclipses Greek satires. Senior intelligence officers complained to CNN’s Jake Tapper about the misleading NYT story, saying, “What’s been articulated in the news is that the intelligence community has concluded that the Russians are trying to help Trump again. But the intelligence doesn’t say that.”

They also said what is amply clear, that the Russians prefer a détente with the United States and are willing to work with anyone who will work for peace. This was dutifully mischaracterized by Pierson then leaked by ideological actors within U.S. intelligence agencies, who are not clearly interested in any détente with Russia.

“It’s more that they understand the president is someone they can work with, he’s a dealmaker. But not that they prefer him over Sanders or Buttigieg or anyone else. So it may have been mischaracterized by Shelby,” Tapper says the national security official told him. Then reports made the rounds that Russians are also apparently helping Bernie Sanders’s campaign. That did not, however, dissuade Hillary Clinton from tweeting that “Putin’s Puppet is at it again, taking Russian help for himself. He knows he can’t win without it. And we can’t let it happen.”

Lawmakers are also baffled at this blunt intel assessment. According to Tapper, “Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tx, methodically asked why ODNI official Shelby Pierson asserted that the Russians had a ‘preference’ for Trump in 2020 election, what was the intelligence behind such an assertion?”

It seems to be a valid line of questioning, given that this administration has been the harshest on Russia since the end of the Cold War, from arming Ukraine to smoking out Russian mercenaries in Syria, as Chris Stewart, R-Utah, and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, also noted. Even Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff seemed skeptical of the new info and pushed back the ODNI, saying that they would like to see the intelligence supporting the assertion, given how politically sensitive and charged it is.

Given that the Trump administration has pursued the Magnitsky Act against Vladimir Putin and his associates, expelled Russian diplomats, started a new European base in Poland, funded and armed Ukraine, and engaged in small-scale proxy conflict with Russian-backed forces, it is only logical to conclude this is an attempt to “poison the well” by the pro-Clinton faction within the media.

There is no question that Moscow remains an adversary, but given its limited reach and geopolitical capability, and that there are no tangible proofs of collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign or any evidence of an actual vote sway due to a few hundred bots on Twitter, this constant hysteria seems to be a desperate attempt to delegitimize the elections in case Trump wins again.

Moscow didn’t select Tom Perez as the Democratic National Committee chair, Moscow didn’t screw up the Iowa caucus, Moscow didn’t create a company called ACRONYM with an app named Shadow, and Moscow is not letting Sanders fly away with the nomination. Moscow is not pushing radicalism within the Democratic Party, from gun confiscation, to homelessness in California, and lax law and order for alien drug gangs and Antifa, to private property bans for billionaires, to the green new deal, to socialism, to higher taxes, to transgenderism and drag story hours, to socialized health care.

Moscow is doing what all great powers do: see which president will be more peaceful and persuadable towards a détente. In 2012, it was President Obama, but then you didn’t hear much from either the media or intelligence leakers about this, as Obama was the chosen one and stacked his intel agencies, something Trump failed to do in his early days.

With the Sanders nomination approaching, Grenell positioned to start a much-needed house-cleaning, and Republicans finally waking up to another delegitimizing attempt, panic among establishment Democrats, and their partners in the media and state, can be expected. One can, therefore, anticipate more such stories in the coming days.

Joe Biden Says He's A Democratic Candidate For The U.S. Senate,"In his latest slip-up, former Vice President Joe Biden said Monday that he was a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate and told voters to support the other Biden in the race if they didn’t like him.

Biden of course, is running for president, and there is no other Biden in the race.

“My name is Joe Biden. I’m a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, if you like what you see help out, if not, vote for the other Biden,” the former vice president said at the South Carolina Democratic Party’s First in the South Dinner.

Of course, the only other Biden who has been widely in the news is no candidate for anything, and certainly no candidate for president. Though Biden served as a senator from Delaware for more than 30 years before being sworn in as vice president in 2009.

Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden attracted widespread media scrutiny for his questionable business dealings with overseas nations at the heart of the recent impeachment trial against President Donald Trump. Democrats charged Trump with holding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in exchange for our eastern European ally launching investigations into the Biden family’s shady dealings with a Ukrainian energy company with a reputation for its corruption.

While his father dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine, Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma earning more than $50,000 a month despite having no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals that the former vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation by Ukrainian executives.

Joe Biden’s latest gaffe in South Carolina comes just days before the critical southern primary that will likely decide the fate of Biden’s presidential campaign on Saturday. After losing the first three contests by wide margins, Biden is depending on South Carolina to be his “firewall” to reclaim his frontrunner status that has since been lost to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who has so far swept the first few contests.

According to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls, Biden still holds a first-place lead with nearly 27 percent support in the Palmetto State. Sanders is still behind with almost 22 percent followed by billionaire Tom Steyer who has nearly 15 percent and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg with nearly 10 percent.

"Bloomberg Hasn't Hid Enough Masculinity For Democrats, But He's Trying","“Let’s get serious here,” a visibly frustrated Michael Bloomberg replied to Gayle King, when asked about whether he would implement his anti-obesity diktats all over the United States: “What’s right for New York City isn’t necessarily right for all the other cities. Otherwise, you’d have a naked cowboy in every city.”

The last two Democrat presidential primary debates, which were mostly reminiscent of “WrestleMania,” included feuds between Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Mayor Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg about who did the homework correctly. Another old man, a former vice president, was on the verge of unmindfully walking off the stage.

Also on display was Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s sheer, vicious hatred for any successful capitalist man, notable in her repeated attempts to scalp Bloomberg, so to speak. But what followed was a clash of two distinct cultures — one resurgent, the other in its last stand.

For the first time, Sen. Bernie Sanders faced serious questions and looked visibly flustered. He wasn’t used to difficult cross-questioning, and his irritated, monotonous, one-track health care and climate change talking points came out.

Bloomberg Takes on the Socialists

But it was Bloomberg who finally took up the hypocrisy of a socialist being a millionaire and owning three houses. For the first time, a candidate with a distinct 1980s Gordon Gekko persona clashed in the Democratic debate, post-Me Too.

While Republicans are used to abrasively macho leaders, the current president being an exemplary one, Democrats have given up on masculinity, and the clashes between Bloomberg and Warren were clashes of arrogance and Me Too feminism. It would be unthinkable for anyone other than Bloomberg to have the guts to say on stage to a female candidate that his female employees signed nondisclosure agreements because they hated his jokes. No one expects that devil-may-care brashness anymore in 2020, much less among the effete liberals. No wonder Bloomberg walked those comments back in the next debate.

But most importantly, Bloomberg took the battle to the socialists within the party, both the open and hidden ones. Yes, he was rusty. Yes, he has lots of baggage. Yes, he was the target, given his money and stature. But Bloomberg concentrated his message on Sanders and even uttered the one C-word no Democrat dares utter: communism, inviting groans from every candidate on stage, including the moderates.

Is the Democratic Party still welcoming to capitalism? This is a Democratic Party that is like a university student union. Here you cannot say anymore that what makes America competitive is capitalism and that Bloomberg has created more jobs with more families dependent on salaries from his organization than all the other candidates on stage combined.

How many of these candidates would affirmatively answer the question of whether they want to see the America of the future as a capitalist superpower? Bloomberg, with all his soda bans, strong law and order, and paternalistic ideas, is still at heart a pragmatic capitalist — which is anachronistic in the current Democratic Party.

Is Bloomberg the Trump of the Democrats?

I followed keenly the long, detailed Bloomberg foreign policy platform, a synthesis of the two distinct trends, a mix between the complete retrenchment and the complete internationalist schools within liberalism. He wants a “withdrawal” from Afghanistan, to continue dialogue with North Korea, and for Ukraine to be “a bridge between Russia and Europe.”

This is a marked change from the attempt to have Ukraine part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, ostensibly a cause of the major rift with Russia, as Ukraine houses Russian military supply chains. Without Ukraine, Moscow ceases to be a great power.

These instincts are distinctly Trumpian. On the other hand, Bloomberg wants to restart Obama’s deal with Iran and diffuse tensions in the Middle East, a more standard Democratic platform. But the last debate featured not a single question on foreign policy.

The reality is that there are no moderates in this Democratic Party. On one hand is the extreme Gramscian left, with identity politics, Me Too feminism, and slavery reparations talking points. On the other hand is the extreme Trotskyist left, with climate change, socialist health care, and apologias for Latin American communism. In between was a lone figure trying to portray himself as the last hope against impending socialist doom. Kyle Smith at National Review wrote something similar a few days back, that part of Bloomberg’s appeal is his outright, in-your-face brashness.

He is very much like Donald Trump, at least in that particular way. He says things that are unthinkable not only in the Democratic Party, but among the current Western sophisticates, in yoga cafes, in corporate America, in diversity universities, and in art and literature.

One of the reasons Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Boris Johnson, Narendra Modi, and other right-wingers won in recent years was psychological. These men are a reaction to the forced feminist social emasculation, a response to political correctness and liberal mores and taboos, and a throwback to an earlier, cigar-chomping, dollar-burning era.

Bloomberg is refreshing in his old-fashioned defense of capitalism and his abrasive, arrogant persona. No one likes a man who’s a spineless coward, constantly apologizing and genuflecting for everything under the sun. Did it work? We’ll have to see. This is not the Democratic Party of the 1980s and 1990s, regardless of how much Bloomberg wants to turn back time.

Hunter Biden Leveraged Family Name For UCLA Professorship,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, touted his family name and political connections to pursue a major gig as a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles, according to emails reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Hunter Biden was pursuing a job at the university to teach a course on drug policy and identified a list of possible guest speakers with close ties to his leading 2020 presidential candidate father.

“In 2019, Hunter Biden inquired about the possibility of teaching a course as UCLA School of Law, and he and school leaders held preliminary conversations about the possibility,” said the law school’s communications executive director Bill Kisliuk in an email to the Caller.

In the end however, Biden will not be teaching at the university after failing to provide the school with additional plans for the prospective class.

“Biden subsequently did not submit further materials for the proposed course, which is a required step when the school is considering adding a course,” Kisliuk told the Caller.

In October, Joe Biden made it sound like it was a done deal telling reporters his son was “gonna be teaching at law school next year.”

Hunter Biden moved to Los Angeles in 2018 but his whereabouts have remained a mystery.

Hunter Biden’s leveraging of his father’s political connections appear to be routine practice. While his father was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine in 2014, Hunter Biden was hired to serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company making at least $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry.

A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much the former vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation. Hunter Biden was paid at least twice the amount of board members at comparable corporations. At Exxon Mobil, a global energy company dwarfing Burisma in size and earnings, its board members only made little more than half of Hunter Biden’s reported payout.

Hunter Biden also served on the board of a trade coalition that sought additional aid to Ukraine from the United States while his father remained the key figure in the White House dictating policy towards the eastern European nation, according to Daily Caller reporting last month.

From 2012 to 2018, Hunter Biden was on the board of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) which lobbied the U.S. government for increased Ukrainian spending and assistance.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/05/hunter-biden-leveraged-family-name-for-ucla-professorship/,2020-03-05
Media Suddenly Interested In Running Interference For Hunter Biden Again,"After weeks of ignoring the series of scandals surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden’s son that surfaced during President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, reporters are suddenly interested again as Biden reclaims his frontrunner status for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The focus on Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, which never received adequate media attention in the first place, tapered off throughout the president’s impeachment trial and became nearly absent by the time Senate proceedings got underway. In the same week Trump was acquitted, Joe Biden’s presidential hopes began to plummet following a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses. Biden’s chances of becoming the nominee only got worse throughout February with each state until the South Carolina primary on Saturday rescuing a sinking campaign.

Now that Biden is back on top in the wake of an extraordinary political comeback capturing 10 states on Super Tuesday, including several he never even campaigned in, many in the media are suddenly reminded that his son will likely remain an issue going forward.

While his father was dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine at the Obama White House in 2014, Hunter Biden was hired on the board of a Ukraine energy company Burisma earning upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much Biden was being showered in excess compensation where board members of comparable corporations made only fraction of Biden’s benefits.

Several questionable transactions with Chinese business leaders have also raised suspicions about Hunter Biden’s work overseas.

In 2013, Hunter Biden boarded Air Force Two with his vice president father on a trip to China and arranged meetings with Chinese businessmen. Soon after, a sequence of events followed to benefit Hunter Biden’s firm, BHR leading to its business license being approved in the east Asian nation and a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges with a Chinese corporation marking “the biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Hunter Biden’s work abroad has drawn scrutiny from senators since 2017 when Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin opened up a probe into Biden’s conflicts of interest.

Some in the media however, appear to have forgotten about investigations into Hunter Biden’s conduct altogether, tying it exclusively to Republican efforts to defend Trump from impeachment or to a political effort launched by the GOP to derail Joe Biden’s campaign. Some have even characterized the ongoing Senate probe into Hunter Biden’s conflicts leveraging familial ties overseas as resurgent, making it seem as if the proceedings that began prior to Joe Biden’s entrance into the presidential race ever stopped after Biden’s apparent collapse.

“Senate GOP ramps up investigations as Biden surges,” read a headline in CNN on Wednesday, co-authored by network congressional correspondent Manu Raju. The headline was later replicated in a chyron displayed on the channel Thursday afternoon.

“Republicans Dive Back Into Hunter Biden Investigations, Saying Voters Deserve It,” fired off the Daily Beast.

“Mitt Romney tells reporters there’s ‘no question’ that the GOP’s resurrected investigation ‘looking into Burisma and Hunter Biden appears political, and I think people are tired of these kind of political investigation,” tweeted NBC reporter Geoff Bennett, emphasis ours.

Nothing has been “resurrected” however, of a continuous investigation that started well before Joe Biden’s run for president that never stopped after Trump’s exoneration or Biden’s February losses.

Of course, Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney also voted to convict Trump in what was purely a political stunt, so he can save the lecturing.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/06/media-suddenly-interested-in-running-interference-for-hunter-biden-again/,2020-03-06
Johnson To Press For Subpoena On Firms Linked To Hunter Biden,"Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson who serves as the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee said Thursday he plans to continue with a subpoena on a consulting firm tied to Hunter Biden and Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.

Johnson had originally planned to subpoena Andrii Telizhenko, a consultant for the firm Blue Star Strategies contracted to do work with Burisma, but cancelled the committee vote scheduled for Wednesday after “discrepancies” in FBI briefings on Capitol Hill.

“There were discrepancies in what had been told in one briefing versus the next briefing, and then even greater discrepancies in staff notes,” Johnson wrote to members of the committee, according to The Hill.

Now Johnson is aiming to compel Blue Star Strategies to turn over records related to Burisma and bring forward the firm’s co-founders, Karen Tramontano and Sally Painter.

“This subpoena is in furtherance of the committee’s ongoing work to address the many unanswered questions about potential conflicts of interest and the extent to which representatives of Burisma – including officials at Blue Star – used individuals with close personal connections to high-level officials within the Obama administration to gain access to and potentially influence U.S. government agencies,” Johnson wrote in a letter to ranking Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan.

Johnson is seeking the consulting firm’s records related to Burisma going back to Jan. 1, 2013 to present. Biden joined Burisma’s board in April 2014, and according to the Daily Caller, connected Blue Star with the Ukrainian energy company in 2015 to combat corruption charges.

“The suggestion was made by both Democratic and Republican members of our committee that we should issue a subpoena directly to the source of the documents relevant to our work: Blue Star,” Johnson wrote to Peters.

The request for subpoenas came as part of a broad investigation into Biden’s perceived conflicts of interest conducting overseas business launched in 2017 by Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa who serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

While his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, was dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine in the Obama White House, Hunter Biden was hired on the board of Burisma earning upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals he was being showered in excess compensation when compared to the level of pay given to board members of even larger corporations. Hunter Biden also flew aboard Air Force Two on a trip with his father to China that was followed by a series of transactions that benefited Biden’s firm.

The Senate probe began to garner widespread media attention last fall after a transcript was released of President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump mentioned Biden’s work in Ukraine that ultimately led to impeachment. On the day of Trump’s acquittal in the Senate, Grassley and Johnson issued demands for Secret Service travel records on Biden to determine whether Biden “used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business” with nations abroad.

The two top Republican senators have also asked for records on Biden from a wide range of government agencies who appear to be cooperating with the senators’ requests. Last month, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden leaked to the press that the Treasury Department had been supplying the senators with documents showing “‘evidence’ of questionable origin,” in the form of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Biden’s overseas work.

Grassley and Johnson responded by pointing out it was “strange that any senator would complain about Congress receiving responses to oversight requests in a timely manner.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/13/sen-johnson-to-move-forward-with-subpoena-on-firms-linked-to-hunter-biden/,2020-03-13
"After Impeaching Trump Over Ukraine, Pelosi Demands Quid Pro Quo Before Releasing Aid To Americans","Personal favors, government corruption, and withholding aid. If the congressional relief bill headlines sound familiar, that’s because we spent the better part of the last year hearing the same phrases from Democrats who alleged President Donald Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to extrapolate favors, caught in the hellish hamster wheel of undoing the 2016 election with Democrats cast in the role of rodents on a spirited sprint to nowhere, and the mainstream media playing the part of the shrill spin machine.

Who could have predicted that a month and a half after the conclusion of the impeachment circus, wherein congressional Democrats and the media establishment lost their minds over a phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, America would be reeling once again — this time from a global pandemic straight out of communist China? Not only that, who would have expected we’d be staring into the face of another quid pro quo? This time from none other than progressive icon Nancy Pelosi herself.

While Senate Democrats and Republicans have been working tirelessly to craft a bipartisan solution to bail out Americans and their businesses suddenly shuddered in a kneecapped economy, the Democratic House speaker waltzed in, promptly dismissed their efforts, and announced her intent to introduce her own relief bill.

Of course, with each passing day and even hour, thousands of businesses are closing, millions of employees are facing layoffs, and more and more people across the country are testing positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, so to say a legislative solution is time-sensitive is to wildly understate the urgency. The U.S. economy is in trouble.

Nancy Pelosi knows that. House Democrats know that. They also know that’s exactly what they want — anything to paint Trump in the worst possible light and stop the incumbent from achieving re-election in November. The booming economy and virtual full employment wouldn’t have fanned the flame of revolution, but a global pandemic with a helping of obstinance might do the trick. But Pelosi’s reticence to come together with both Senate Republicans and Democrats isn’t even the worst of the partisan slime.

Pelosi thought a global pandemic would be a good time to push through a laundry list of progressive pipe dreams. Instead of directing her efforts toward aiding ailing citizens, the House speaker’s 1,400-page bill proposal, which began circulating Monday, provides for non-COVID-19 frivolities such as “grants for conducting” election audits, as well as “same day [voter] registration” and access for early voting. It includes “collective bargaining … for federal workers,” a federal “study on climate mitigation efforts,” expanded solar and wind energy tax credits, and it demands that airlines “fully offset the annual carbon emissions … for domestic flights beginning in 2025” and give passengers information “regarding greenhouse gas emissions resulting from each individual flight.”

Don’t let it be lost on you, America, that the reason your small business isn’t yet getting relief yet is that House Democrats are more concerned with bailing out the U.S. Postal Service and giving $35 million to D.C.’s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts than fighting for their constituents.

This is to say nothing of the bill’s woke identity politics aims such as “corporate board diversity” requirements and “pay equity” between men and women as well as white employees and minorities. The words “diverse” or “diversity” appear in the bill more than 60 times.

By holding Americans hostage unless she gets her carbon emission fantasies and postal bailouts, Nancy Pelosi is offering her own quid pro quo. You want relief for dying Americans, Mr. President? Fine, give me more minorities and women in board position. Otherwise, I’ll withhold the aid.

You give me what I want, I’ll give you what you want. Quid pro quo, plain and simple, or as Pelosi herself might say, “bribery.”

Back in fall 2019, when Pelosi first launched the Trump impeachment inquiry, the speaker said she didn’t want it to “take a long time because I don’t want it to be further divisive in the country. And that was one of the reasons I was reluctant to go down this path because I know it’s divisive. But then again, the president is divisive.” Pot, meet kettle.

Since Pelosi’s joke of a virus bill began circulating Monday, it appears she may now capitulate to growing pressures from exasperated Americans to advance the bipartisan legislation.

Worth noting that the changes to the Senate bill are minimal and could have easily occurred the same way without filibuster or House bill so what happened? Dems realized trying to hold a relief bill hostage for special interests was backfiring and people were pissed. https://t.co/TeZ6xtTwgo — AG (@AGHamilton29) March 24, 2020

But even if she folds and finally grants the aid Americans desperately need, under the Democrats’ self-righteous and asinine quid pro quo framework, Pelosi’s still guilty. After all, Trump never actually withheld aid from Ukraine either, and the House still impeached him.

“I can’t tell if he knows right from wrong,” Pelosi said of Trump’s July 17 phone call with the Ukrainian president. “He just done wrong.”

Do you know right from wrong, Madam Speaker?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/24/after-impeaching-trump-over-ukraine-nancy-pelosi-demands-quid-pro-quo-before-releasing-aid-to-americans/,2020-03-24
Why Inspector General Michael Atkinson Roundly Deserved To Be Fired,"On Saturday, reporters queried President Trump about his Friday firing of Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Trump’s response seemingly confirmed the left-leaning press and Democrats’ narrative that the firing was retaliation for the IG informing the House Intelligence Committee of a whistleblower’s complaint. That complaint concerned Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president that set in motion Trump’s impeachment.

But what the media and Trump’s political opponents won’t tell you is that Trump is right. Atkinson bestowed on the still-unnamed intelligence officer a “whistleblower status he doesn’t deserve.” “He is a fake whistleblower,” Trump said.

The MSM also won’t report the other troubling aspects of Atkinson’s handling of the fake whistleblower’s complaint, some of which Trump also touched on in the briefing. A full vetting of Atkinson’s handling of the so-called whistleblower’s complaint confirms Trump’s take that Atkinson “did an absolutely terrible job.”

But this does require a deep dive into both the law and the fact, as opposed to a mere mimicking of the Democrats’ talking points that seems the default of today’s lazy journalists. So, here are the details you need to know to fully understand why Trump lost confidence in Atkinson and opted to exercise his presidential power-of-appointment prerogative and replace him.

The Ukrainian Phone Call

On Aug. 12, 2019, a still-unnamed CIA official filed with the ICIG a nine-page complaint that alleged Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.” The so-called whistleblower complaint relied on hearsay and second-hand information to support its allegations, as well as a bevy of newspaper reports.

The genesis of the complaint was a July 25, 2019, telephone conversation between Trump and the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint portrayed Trump’s call with Zelensky as demanding a quid-pro-quo investigation “into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden” in exchange for U.S. subsidies to Ukraine.

On Aug. 26, 2019, Atkinson forwarded the supposed whistleblower complaint to the then-acting director of national intelligence (DNI), Joseph Maguire. In forwarding the complaint to Maguire, Atkinson maintained that the allegations fell within the statutory provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistle Protection Act (ICWPA). That statute, if applicable, would have provided both whistleblower protection to the complainant and required the DNI to forward the complaint within seven days to the intelligence committees.

But, as Maguire later told the House Intelligence Committee, “because the allegations on their face did not appear to fall into the statutory framework, the Acting DNI consulted the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel concerning IG Atkinson’s conclusion that the ICWPA applied.” Maguire included the inspector general “in those consultations.”

The Allegations Didn’t Fit the Whistleblower Definition

In a detailed opinion issued on Sept. 3, 2019, the Office of Legal Counsel confirmed that the ICWPA did not apply to the allegations presented to Atkinson under the auspices of a whistleblower complaint. Rather, as the opinion confirmed, the ICWPA only applies to a statutorily defined “urgent concern,” which, for purposes of the complaint lodged against Trump, required the allegations to concern “a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or Executive order or deficiency relating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of National Intelligence involving classified information but does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters” (emphasis added).

But, as the Office of Legal Counsel explained, the complaint against the president did not accuse the president of misconduct related “to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity.” Rather, the complainant charged Trump with “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election”—an allegation the transcript from the call negated, in any event. Moreover, the DNI does not have “responsibility and authority” over Trump, making the ICWPA further inapplicable to the situation at hand.

Accordingly, the Legal Counsel concluded in a memorandum opinion that, because the “complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community,” the ICWPA did not apply.

The Office of Legal Counsel, however, did not leave matters there. “Our conclusion that the ‘urgent concern’ requirement is inapplicable does not mean that the DNI or the ICIG must leave such allegations unaddressed,” it stressed. Rather, “should the DNI or the ICIG receive a credible complaint of alleged criminal conduct that does not involve an ‘urgent concern,’ the appropriate action is to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, rather than to report to the intelligence committees under section 3033(k)(5).” The Legal Counsel then noted that it had referred the complaint to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice “for appropriate review.”

Atkinson Sidesteps DOJ, Sends to Political Hack

Atkinson ignored the Legal Counsel’s opinion that “the appropriate action is to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, rather than to report to the intelligence committees.” On Sept. 9, 2019, he dispatched a letter to Rep. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, informing him of the complaint. The following day, Schiff demanded Maguire provide the complaint to the committee—something Maguire could not do because it contained communications protected by executive privilege.

In his letter, Schiff also falsely called the complaint a whistleblower complaint and asserted the acting DNI was withholding it from the committee in violation of his “express obligations under the law.” Schiff then implied the White House had somehow interfered to prevent Maguire from fulfilling his duties.

Predictably, a media firestorm erupted, eventually prompting Trump to waive executive privilege and release a copy of both the complaint and a readout of his call to the Ukrainian president. Months later, on Dec. 18, 2019, the Democratic-controlled House impeached President Trump on an abuse of power charge related to his communications with the Ukrainian ambassador and a charge of obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted Trump on Feb. 5, 2020.

Atkinson Didn’t Do Basic Review of the Complaint

In the process, many more details were disclosed about the complaint, the complainant, and Atkinson’s handling of the matter. For instance, declassified documents revealed that Atkinson determined the complaint “appeared credible” even though the complainant “was not a direct witness to the President’s telephone call with the Ukrainian President,” and even though “as part of its preliminary review, the ICIG did not request access to records of the President’s July 25, 2019, call with the Ukrainian President.”

Had Atkinson reviewed the read-out of Trump’s July 25 call, he would have discovered numerous allegations contained in the complaint were false:

For example, the complainant falsely alleged that Trump demanded Zelensky return multiple servers from CrowdStrike, an IT contractor for the Democratic National Committee, that were physically located in Ukraine. Trump made no such demand. The complainant also alleged that Trump urged Zelensky to either hire or retain a particular government prosecutor in Ukraine. That exchange never happened. Additionally, the complainant alleged that a specific State Department official had listened in on the phone call between the two leaders. The State Department stated last week that particular official did not listen in on the phone call.

These blatant falsehoods, which Atkinson would have discovered had he done his due diligence, call into question his conclusion that the complaint “appears credible.” Atkinson’s judgment in finding the complaint “appears credible” is further suspect given that the Atkinson admitted that the claimant had an arguable political bias “in favor of a rival political candidate.”

That Atkinson couldn’t read between the lines of the lawyerly crafted nine-page complaint and see the political hit job in the making also calls into question his acumen and good sense. The tell came early, when the claimant suggested that “Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well” in the supposed misconduct—a clear attempt to sideline a second attorney general.

Atkinson also failed to spot the “whistleblower’s” deceptive spot-quoting of the relevant statutory language—something necessary to create the appearance that the complaint qualified as an “urgent matter” within the meaning of the ICWPA. Here’s what the complainant wrote:

Significantly, the complainant omitted from the quote the statutory requirement that the misconduct is “relating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of the National Intelligence.”

Atkinson should have noticed the selective quoting used in the complaint and realized the reason for the omission: the quid pro quo scenario the supposed whistleblower was selling did not implicate the ICWPA because it did not involve an intelligence activity and Trump was not subject to the authority of the DNI.

Fishy Edits to Whistleblower Form

Atkinson also should have smelled a second coup attempt in the making: He should have smelled Schiff, whose staff coordinated with the so-called whistleblower and directed him to file a complaint with Atkinson.

Schiff’s involvement with the “whistleblower” wasn’t the only fishy fact revealed since news first broke of the “whistleblower’s” complaint against Trump. The Federalist’s Sean Davis uncovered stealth edits the ICIG’s office had made to the whistleblower forms, deleting a stated requirement that, for a complaint to be deemed “credible,” the whistleblower must possess “first-hand information”—something Trump’s accuser lacked.

Atkinson’s office later admitted it had changed the forms. House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee questioned Atkinson about the changes and his decision to accept the complaint based on hearsay and rumor. But Schiff has blocked the release of the transcript of Atkinson’s House testimony, leaving the public in the dark concerning why Atkinson changed the stated first-hand information requirement.

That Hidden Testimony Is Damaging to Atkinson

In January, Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, told “The Sara Carter Show” that “everyone needs to see that testimony and the reason that it’s not being released is because it’s very damaging, not only to the whistleblower, but also to Atkinson himself.” Nunes also told Carter, “Republicans have an active investigation into Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.”

Nunes confirmed yesterday that “Intelligence Committee Republicans have been investigating Atkinson’s handling of the whistleblower complaint and failed to get satisfactory answers or documents that we repeatedly requested.” “Chairman Schiff should send the transcript of Atkinson’s briefing on the whistleblower complaint for declassification review so the American people can see his explanations for themselves,” Nunes told The Federalist.

Given that Nunes’ memo on FISA abuse proved thoroughly accurate—if not understated—his claim that Atkinson’s testimony was damaging to both the whistleblower and to Atkinson deserve credence. Speaking of FISA abuse, in an added wrinkle, Nunes highlighted Atkinson’s previous position in the National Security Division, telling The Federalist that “the new IG report on FISA abuse is damning concerning the time Atkinson served in the National Security Division, when he was responsible for reviewing FISA applications.”

What Is Michael Atkinson Hiding?

Atkinson’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee also proved lacking, revealed in a scathing letter penned by Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the committee. Following Atkinson’s Sept. 26, 2019

testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cotton chastised Atkinson for his “disappointing testimony” that “was evasive to the point of being insolent and obstructive.” Cotton also rebuked Atkinson for refusing “to disclose to SSCI members why Atkinson initially determined the anti-Trump complainant had a partisan political bias against Trump.”

“Despite repeated questions, you refused to explain what you meant in your written report by ‘indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of a rival political candidate,’” Cotton wrote. “This information is, of course, unclassified and we were meeting in a closed setting. Yet you moralized about how you were duty bound not to share even a hint of this political bias with us.”

Cotton added that, according to media reports, Atkinson had disclosed “to the House Intelligence Committee not only that the complainant is a registered Democrat, but also that he has a professional relationship with a Democratic presidential campaign.” Cotton then directed Atkinson to inform the Senate Intelligence Committee of “the exact nature and examples of the anti-Trump complainant’s partisan political bias against the president.” Atkinson, however, did not provide the Senate the requested information.

This Guy Is Either Incompetent or Playing Games

This timeline and added details reveal many problems with Atkinson’s performance, beginning with his inability to properly interpret the unambiguous statutory language of the ICWPA. That plain language proves the “whistleblower” was a “fake whistleblower.”

Atkinson also ignored the Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion that where a matter is not covered by the ICWPA, but potentially involves criminal conduct, “the appropriate action is to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, rather than to report to the intelligence committees under section 3033(k)(5).” Further, IG Atkinson knew the matter had already been referred to the Criminal Division of the DOJ, but nonetheless informed Schiff of his receipt of the non-ICWPA complaint. That decision evidences a disregard for the competency and integrity of the DOJ.

Atkinson’s conclusion that a complaint based solely on hearsay and second-hand information appeared “credible” is also questionable. And that Atkinson reached this conclusion without reviewing the read-out of Trump’s call with the Ukraine president and in light of the political bias of the claimant further calls into question Atkinson’s judgment.

The changes to the whistleblower forms and the deletion of the stated “first-hand knowledge” requirement is even more troubling, as is the fact that Atkinson could not provide satisfactory answers to the House Committee and refused to respond to questions posed by the Senate’s Intelligence Committee. Or, in Trump-speak: He did an absolutely terrible job.

GOP Senators Request New Records And Interviews In Biden Probe,"Two top Republican senators, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have formally requested more information from the State Department as part of an ongoing probe into the Obama administration’s potential conflicts of interest with dealings related to Burisma and Ukraine.

After analyzing material provided by the State Department, Grassley and Johnson are asking the department to hand over more records related to then-Vice President Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian leaders in addition to making several key witnesses available for interviews in the investigation.

The two senators are particularly honing in on records surrounding Biden’s connection to the dismissal of former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin who was reportedly investigating the natural gas company Burisma where Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board. Joe Biden, who dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine in the Obama White House, once bragged about playing a key role in Shokin’s firing during a panel discussion in 2018. Meanwhile, Hunter Biden was raking in upwards of $50,000 a month on the foreign corporation’s board despite having no prior experience in the energy industry prior to joining the board, a compensation far higher than comparable companies of similar size.

Johnson and Grassley are demanding “all records” related to Joe Biden’s communications with then-Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko to be turned over, “especially with regard to any mention of the Ukrainian Prosecutor Genera’s investigation of Burisma of Viktor Shokin,” on top of records related to the department’s assessments of Shokin including when the U.S. government wanted Ukraine’s top prosecutor removed.

The two senators are also requesting that the department make Ambassadors Bridget Brink and Geoffrey Pyatt available to committee investigators in addition to Elisabeth Zentos, who served on the National Security Council and in 2016, and participated in meetings between U.S.-Ukrainian officials. They also requested to speak with George Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, who was a star witness in the recent presidential impeachment saga.

The senators previously requested records from the January 2016 meeting in question last fall.

Thursday’s demands are the latest in the GOP Senate probe of Biden’s conflicts in Ukraine launched in 2017. In February, senators requested Secret Service travel records of Hunter Biden’s overseas trips to China and Ukraine to determine whether the vice president’s son was using government-sponsored travel to conduct private business.

In 2013, Hunter Biden flew aboard Air-Force Two with his father to China and arranged meetings with Chinese businessmen. Soon after, a series of transactions followed that benefited Hunter Biden’s firm, BHR raising suspicions about the cross-Pacific trip.

Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon confirmed in February of the presence of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from the Treasury Department provided to the Republican-led probe showing “evidence of questionable origin,” related to Hunter Biden’s overseas business.

Senate Subpoenas Records From Hunter Biden-Linked Firm,"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee spearheaded by Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson approved a subpoena for records related to Hunter Biden’s suspicious business activity in Ukraine.

Senate lawmakers gave the green-light to compel records by a partisan vote from Blue Star Strategies, a lobbying firm which had done contract work with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma where Biden served on the board despite the absence of any experience in the industry. According to a Federalist analysis of Biden’s pay upwards of $50,000 a month, Biden was being showered in excess compensation raking in far more than board members with corporations of similar size.

Wednesday’s vote comes two months after Johnson initially planned to subpoena Blue Star Stategies consultant Andrii Telizhenko, but called off the vote to expand the scope of records requests. The latest subpoena comes as part of an ongoing probe led by Johnson and fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa into Biden’s overseas conflicts of interest while Biden’s father served as vice president guiding the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.

Democrats objected to Wednesday’s vote as a partisan sideshow seven months out from the upcoming presidential election while the nation remains in crisis.

“At this moment when Americans need is to work together, this extremely partisan investigation is pulling us apart,” charged Michigan Sen. Gary Peters who serves as the ranking Democrat on the committee and faces a competitive challenge in November.

The Senate probe into Biden’s questionable business activity overseas however, has been ongoing since 2017, long before former Vice President Joe Biden jumped into the crowded race for president.

“The question I would ask it: What is everybody worried about? If there’s nothing there, we’ll find out there’s nothing there. But if there’s something there, the American people need to know that,” Johnson said defending the committee’s decision to move forward with the subpoena.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/20/senate-subpoenas-records-from-hunter-biden-linked-firm/,2020-05-20
Alexander Vindman Cries 'Bullying' As Peers Are Promoted,"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified against President Donald Trump in the Democratic House’s fall impeachment trial— destroying his own credibility in the process—made headlines this week after announcing his retirement from the Army, citing “bullying, intimidation and retaliation” from Trump.

“After more than 21 years of military service, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman is retiring today after it has been made clear that his future within the institution he has dutifully served will forever be limited,” Vindman’s lawyer David Pressman said in a statement.

If that legacy includes becoming a pawn for House Democrats in their deep state impeachment hoax, leaking classified documents to undermine the president, lamenting it would be a “great honor” to serve as defense minister of a foreign country, and engaging in open insubordination, then yes, Vindman served “dutifully.”

Vindman’s retirement comes the same week as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent earned a promotion, according to officials familiar with the matter who spoke to Foreign Policy Magazine. The president signed off on Kent’s advancement.

Throughout the Democrats’ sham impeachment saga, Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine, offered testimony that actually built a case for investigating the Biden family’s dealings with the eastern European ally rather than bring forward any new major evidence Trump pushed an alleged “quid pro quo” on the Ukrainian president.

“My concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent said of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company named Burisma while his father was dictating White House policy on Ukraine.

A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay would later reveal the extent to which the vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation, earning upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry which nearly doubles those on the board of Exxon Mobil, an energy company worth billions more than Burisma.

During Vindman’s appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, the lieutenant colonel attempted to contradict others who exonerated the president but only contradicted himself getting caught in an open lie about his resume and displaying his insubordination.

Kent, according to Foreign Policy Magazine, was first recommended for a promotion among a select group of other diplomats last summer, months before House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment proceedings.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/10/alexander-vindman-cries-retaliation-while-president-promotes-another-impeachment-witness/,2020-07-10
The Atlantic’s Hit Job On Trump Follows The Left’s Propaganda Playbook,"On Friday, while President Trump celebrated yet another historic diplomatic achievement, with Serbia and Kosovo committing to economic normalization with each other and advancing their relationships with Israel, the press instead focused on a hit piece The Atlantic ran based on unnamed sources.

Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg opened his Thursday “exclusive,” by proclaiming that “when President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that ‘the helicopter couldn’t fly’ and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.”

Rather, Goldberg claimed, according to “four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day,” “Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead.” The article continued with offensive quotes about our troops the unnamed sources attributed to Trump.

Soon after the article hit, named sources with undisputed firsthand knowledge of the visit cancelation refuted the charges. Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, calling the story “BS,” countered, “I was actually there and one of the people part of the discussion — this never happened.” Outspoken Trump critic John Bolton told Bloomberg he hadn’t heard the president say any of those things.

The Atlantic’s story also conflicted with Bolton’s recounting of what he called in his anti-Trump book a “straightforward decision to cancel the visit.” In it, he also confirmed that the “Marine One’s crew was saying that bad visibility could make it imprudent to chopper to the cemetery.” Likewise, Bolton’s memoir restated the rationale for not taking a motorcade, noting it posed “an unacceptable risk.” And then there were the government documents obtained in open-records requests that eviscerated The Atlantic’s tale.

As The Atlantic’s story crumbled, the Associated Press and Fox News claimed corroboration or confirmation of the story. However, as Glenn Greenwald at The Intercept explained in his must-read piece, “Journalism’s New Propaganda Tool: Using ‘Confirmed’ to Mean its Opposite”:

But if one looks at what [the AP and Fox News] actually did, at what this ‘confirmation’ consists of, it is the opposite of what that word would mean, or should mean, in any minimally responsible sense. AP, for instance, merely claims that ‘a senior Defense Department official with firsthand knowledge of events and a senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump’s comments confirmed some of the remarks to The Associated Press,’ while Fox merely said ‘a former senior Trump administration official who was in France traveling with the president in November 2018 did confirm other details surrounding that trip.’

Not only was The Atlantic’s story not confirmed by the supposed corroboration of some of the details, but there is also no way you can confirm a story premised solely on anonymous sources: A journalist cannot possibly know if he is receiving confirmation of the facts by another source, or merely hearing the same lies from the same source who peddled the initial story.

Greenwald highlighted how that had happened when CNN falsely reported, based on anonymous sources, that “during the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump, Jr. had received a September 4 email with a secret encryption key that gave him advanced access to WikiLeaks’ servers containing the DNC emails which the group would subsequently release to the public ten days later.” MSNBC and CBS both “confirmed” CNN’s reporting, even though, as the outlets were later forced to admit, the email sent to Trump Jr., was actually dated Sept. 14, 2016 — after the WikiLeaks release.

So how did two outlets “confirm” the Fake News CNN had run earlier in the day? “All that happened,” Greenwald explained, “was that the same sources which anonymously whispered these unverified, false claims to CNN then went and repeated the same unverified, false claims to other outlets, which then claimed that they ‘independently confirmed’ the story even though they had done nothing of the sort.”

Revisiting the many hit pieces launched at Trump since he first entered the political sphere reveals the same technique in play, especially with SpyGate. The Atlantic’s latest contribution to the Fake News franchise struck a familiar chord, but not just one played in the press. Rather, the incident seemed eerily similar to the Crossfire Hurricane team’s use of anonymous press stories as supposed confirmation of the anonymously sourced Christopher Steele dossier in the four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications targeting Carter Page.

In seeking the FISA surveillance orders on Page, the DOJ and FBI relied heavily on the dossier that was compiled by former British MI6 operative Steele. Steele, in turn, purportedly relied on a network of unnamed sources and sub-source. Then the FBI in the FISA applications portrayed Steele’s “intel” as confirmed by media reporting.

For instance, the FISA applications included this lengthy passage that sought to imply confirmation of the Steele dossier:

On or about September 23, 2016, an identified news organization published an article, (September 23rd News Article), which was written by the news organization’s Chief Investigative Correspondent, alleging that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating Page with respect to suspected efforts by the Russian Government to influence the U.S. Presidential election. According to the September 23rd News Article, U.S. officials received intelligence reports that when Page was in Moscow in July 2016 to deliver the above-noted commencement address at the New Economic School, he met with two senior Russian officials. The September 23rd News Article stated that a ‘well-placed Western intelligence source’ told the news organization that Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft. At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page. According to the September 23 News Article, the Western intelligence source also reported that U.S. intelligence agencies received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide-Igor Divyekin, a former Russian security official who now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election.

Of course, we now know that the “September 23 News Article” was the Yahoo news article and that the “well-placed Western intelligence source” was Steele. Thus what the FBI presented to the FISA court as confirmation of Steele’s reporting was nothing of the sort. It was merely an echo chamber.

The FBI repeated this deceptive strategy two additional times in the Page FISA applications, relying on Josh Rogin’s Washington Post opinion piece and Michael Crowley’s Politico article to together imply confirmation of Page’s status as a Russian agent. The FISA applications used those articles to paint Page as a Putin patsy who bore responsibility for the Republican National Committee’s supposed watering down of the party platform’s position on Ukraine.

However, Page had nothing to do with the RNC’s platform changes concerning Ukraine. Yet the FBI used the press-peddled speculation as evidence in the FISA applications. That “evidence” suggested to the FISA court that there was confirmation of Steele’s reporting that Page had struck a deal with Putin associates to accept a stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifted Ukrainian sanctions. There was no such confirmation, however, because there was no such deal.

It is bad enough that the press uses faux “confirmations” to push propaganda to serve its political purposes. But it is beyond the pale that the Crossfire Hurricane team used the same technique to obtain court-ordered surveillance of Page (and in turn the Trump campaign) and that the FISA court fell for this hoax.

Don’t expect the corporate media that perfected this means of propaganda to report on the government’s use of this technique in the Page FISA applications. It won’t. But since the public no longer needs the legacy media to learn the truth, the press’ self-imposed silence will do nothing but reinforce their reputation as purveyors of Fake News.

"Vindman, Not Whistleblower, Was Driving Force Behind Impeachment","The most interesting thing about Byron York’s exhaustively reported and richly detailed new impeachment book, “Obsession: Inside the Washington Establishment’s Never-Ending War on Trump,” is that the whistleblower who filed the official complaint that got impeachment rolling isn’t ever identified.

It turns out that the heated discussion over the whistleblower, who was previously identified by Real Clear Investigations as the CIA’s Eric Ciaramella, was a diversion from allowing the American people to understand who was the actual instigator of the failed effort to oust President Donald Trump from office.

Rather than being a witness who independently supported the claims of the whistleblower, the National Security Council’s Lt. Col Alex Vindman was the driving force behind the entire operation, according to the book’s interviews with key figures in the impeachment probe and other evidence. The whistleblower’s information came directly from Vindman, investigators determined.

“Vindman was the person on the call who went to the whistleblower after the call, to give the whistleblower the information he needed to file his complaint,” said Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y.

“For all intents and purposes, Vindman is the whistleblower here, but he was able to get somebody else to do his dirty work for him,” explained one senior congressional aide.

Vindman was the only person at the National Security Council (NSC) listening in on the infamous call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to be concerned by it. Vindman immediately began talking to his identical twin brother Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, who also worked at the NSC. The twins both complained to NSC Counsel John Eisenberg. Alex Vindman talked about it with his direct supervisor Tim Morrison, who was also on the call. He talked about it with another NSC lawyer, Michael Ellis.

Vindman testified that he talked to only two people outside the NSC. One was George Kent, a State Department official who dealt with Ukraine. He refused to say who the other person was. Both Vindman and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the impeachment proceedings, strenuously resisted any attempt by investigators to discuss who the other individual was, admitting only that it was a member of the “intelligence community,” the same nebulous descriptor used for the whistleblower.

In his complaint, the whistleblower claimed “multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call” described to him the contents of the conversation. It is unclear if he was sourcing his knowledge just to multiple Vindmans or any other White House officials.

The description of the call appeared to come from the White House’s rough transcript, which Vindman helped prepare. It repeated Vindman’s unique interpretation of the call as seeking foreign interference in a campaign. It mentioned that lawyers had been informed, and Vindman had done just that. The complaint also included information from public news reports.

At first Schiff publicly promised that the whistleblower would testify and that any attempt by the White House to thwart that would be fought vigorously. But then news broke that Schiff’s office had worked with the whistleblower prior to him filing his complaint. Schiff switched his stance to refusing to allow the whistleblower to testify. What’s more, he refused to allow any investigation into how the Ukraine investigation began.

The real instigator of the Ukraine investigation, Vindman, testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on October 29, 2019, and returned to the House in November for public testimony. York writes that Vindman’s extensive testimony was more complex than news reports suggested.

Vindman repeatedly said that he viewed Trump’s phone call with Zelensky as “wrong,” but he was unable to articulate precisely why. He expressed frustration that the elected president was pushing a foreign policy at odds from the “interagency consensus” of the bureaucracy that he felt should control foreign policy.

Vindman admitted under questioning that he had thrice been offered the prestigious position of defense minister for the Ukraine government. Despite his focus on Ukraine at the NSC, Vindman did not appear knowledgeable about well-established Ukrainian corruption problems. Vindman is a Ukrainian American. He grew hostile with members who sought to understand exactly to whom he had disclosed the phone call.

Using detailed information from interviews with White House officials, members of Congress, and their key staff, York shows how Republicans had to deal with Rep. Adam Schiff’s determination to hide from the American public not just who the whistleblower was but anything about the process that led to the whistleblower complaint.

But Schiff’s behavior inadvertently confirmed how the whistleblower found his information. Every time that members asked about the second non-NSC person Vindman disclosed the call to, Schiff and other Democrats would direct the witness to not answer in order to “protect the whistleblower.” York writes:

Could that have been any clearer? The Republican line of questioning established that: 1) Vindman told two people outside the NSC. 2) One of them was George Kent. And 3) The other was in the Intelligence Community but could not be revealed because Democrats did not want to identify the whistleblower. It did not take a rocket scientist to conclude that that unidentified other person was the whistleblower.

York shows that one of the reasons Republicans stopped pressing the issue was that while they opposed Vindman pushing his own foreign policy goals over the president’s, they respected his military service. “Republicans saw Vindman as a loyal American who had strong and inflexible views on what U.S. policy toward Ukraine should be and who was offended, and spurred to action, when the President of the United States appeared to change them,” York writes.

When Vindman retired from the Army in July 2020, media reports claimed he did so because of a hostile work environment. He had been transferred from the NSC in February 2020, following Trump’s acquittal on the charges that Vindman’s complaints instigated. Vindman received no punishment for his insubordination and disobeying of a direct order to not work with Congress on impeachment.

Leaked Call Reveals Biden Risked National Security To Sabotage Trump,"A recently leaked phone call between then-Vice President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko directly after the 2016 presidential election shows that Biden sought to sabotage the incoming Trump administration before Donald Trump even took office, and much worse.

During the course of the call, Biden badmouthed the incoming administration, saying, “The truth of the matter is that the incoming administration doesn’t know a great deal about [Ukraine]” and that they were unprepared for the transition. This in itself is inappropriate, but it was meant to set the stage for Biden’s next statement and future plans.

Biden then told Poroshenko, “I don’t plan on going away. As a private citizen, I plan on staying deeply engaged in the endeavor that you have begun and we have begun.” In a matter of moments, Biden undermined the incoming administration, branded them as not knowing anything about Ukraine, and attempted to set up a foreign policy backchannel for himself after he left office as a private citizen, which could violate the Logan Act.

The Logan Act bars private citizens from engaging in U.S. foreign policy, although its constitutionality remains questionable and no person has ever been convicted of violating it since it was signed into law in 1799. Ironically, this is the same act that, at Joe Biden’s suggestion, the FBI accused National Security Advisor Michael Flynn of violating as a result of a discussion Flynn had with the Russian ambassador to the United States around nearly the same time as Biden’s call with Poroshenko.

To fortify his position and to make Poroshenko more confident that he should continue to deal with Biden once he left office, in the call Biden also intimated that there is a problem with the incoming administration: “The reason I bother to tell you that is I have been somewhat limited on what I am able to tell their team about Ukraine.”

While Biden blamed this on a late start to the transition process, we now know he said this at the same time the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies were conducting a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, known as “Crossfire Hurricane,” of which Ukraine was a part.

Since it was leaked by a Ukrainian member of Parliament, the phone call was obviously recorded by the Ukrainians, and almost certainly by Russian intelligence services. Biden would have been aware of this from his time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president.

So Biden, the sitting vice president of the United States, told a foreign leader whose country was part of a highly classified FBI counterintelligence investigation that there were things he couldn’t share about his country with the incoming administration and that they weren’t cleared. We now know from subsequent investigations that the Trump administration did not in fact collude with Russia, but at the time, Biden didn’t and he was privy to the fact that the FBI had opened the investigation.

If Russian intelligence had actually penetrated the incoming Trump administration, Biden’s comments would have almost certainly tipped them off that something was amiss, placing our national security in grave danger.

Additionally, it is mind-boggling that the vice president felt comfortable telling a foreign leader that there were things he was unable to tell the incoming administration at the same time the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to notify President-elect Trump of potential counterintelligence risks (that ended up not being true) posed by members of his campaign team who might join his administration in official capacities.

In the end, it is clear that Biden exercised incredibly poor judgment, placing a highly classified counterintelligence operation at risk; undermined the incoming administration; and attempted to set up a foreign policy backchannel for himself so he could remain involved in U.S-Ukrainian policy even though he was not sanctioned to do so by law.

All of this took place while his son, Hunter Biden, was on the payroll of a Ukrainian energy firm for which he admitted he had no related experience.

Kerry Lied About Not Knowing Of Hunter Biden's Business In Ukraine,"New documents unveiled in an explosive Senate report Wednesday show former Secretary of State John Kerry lied to reporters when asked whether he was aware of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son serving in a lucrative board position for a Ukrainian energy company.

“I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No,” Kerry said in December last year at the height of President Donald Trump’s impeachment process, which shed light on the Biden family’s conflicts of interest in Ukraine.

In a gaggle with reporters after @JoeBiden's town hall in Nashua, NH, I asked @JohnKerry, who was Sec of State at the time, if he knew and was comfortable when Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma: ""I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No."" pic.twitter.com/j3lazGcbhb — Amanda Golden (@amandawgolden) December 8, 2019

The new joint report out from the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee with the Senate Treasury Committee, however, shows otherwise.

According to congressional investigators, Kerry’s Chief of Staff David Wade briefed Kerry on press inquiries specifically related to Hunter Biden’s arrangement of recently joining the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Records show Hunter Biden raked in upwards of $50,000 a month from serving on the board despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis shows Hunter Biden was being compensated far higher than board members on the leadership of larger corporations in the same field.

Wade told the committee investigators that he relayed to Kerry that the secretary’s stepson, Christopher Heinz’s, business partners Hunter Biden and Devon Archer both joined the board of Burisma but that Heinz had refrained from getting involved with the company. Below is a transcript of Wade’s interview with the Senate probe, emphasis theirs:

Question: What was Secretary Kerry’s reaction to you informing him of these news inquiries about Mr. Heinz and the additional information regarding Mr. Archer’s [and] Mr. Hunter Biden’s connection and involvement with Burisma? Wade: He knew nothing about it. Question: So he learned about this information from you? Wade: I believe so, yeah.

Separately, Senate officials noted, State Department officials forwarded articles to the secretary with headlines, “Biden’s son joins Ukrainian gas company’s board,” “Biden’s son joins Ukrainian gas producer board,” and “White House says no issue with Biden’s son, Ukrainian gas company.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/23/records-show-john-kerry-lied-about-ignorance-of-hunter-bidens-lucrative-position-in-ukraine/,2020-09-23
Senate Report: Burisma Bribed Officials After Hunter Biden Joined Board,"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released the first part of its long-awaited report with the Senate Treasury Committee Wednesday detailing a wide array of Hunter Biden’s conflicts of interest, including potentially criminal overseas business activity while his father Joe Biden served as vice president.

Among the key findings in the report are substantial allegations that Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, from which Hunter Biden raked in upwards of $50,000 a month for serving the board, paid a $7 million bribe to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office to close an investigation seven months following Hunter Biden’s addition to its leadership.

According to the report, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine, told congressional investigators that he learned of the bribe from First Deputy Prosecutor General Anatoliy Danylenko during a Kyiv meeting on Feb. 3., 2015. The bribe was meant to close Ukrainian investigations and release $23 million of Zlochevsky’s frozen assets by British officials. At the time, Daylenko was the country’s number two prosecutor serving under Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Vitaly Yarema. One week after Kent confrontation with Danylenko, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fired Yarema and other members of his team.

Kent testified that he learned shortly after the meeting with Danylenko that Hunter Biden was sitting on the board of the Ukrainian energy company owned by Zlochevsky. Biden’s role was supposedly to consult on corporate governance and transparency. Hunter Biden joined the firm and raked in excess compensation despite no prior experience in the industry just weeks after his business partner, Devon Archer, met with Joe Biden at the White House. Joe Biden had just recently been described by the press as the Obama administration’s “public face of the administration’s handling of Ukraine.”

Kent reportedly told lawmakers that the Department of Justice official at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv relayed the allegation of Zlochevsky’s $7 million bribe to the FBI. The Senate committees are still awaiting answers on what actions the federal law enforcement agency took, if any.

Kent also told lawmakers that upon learning of Hunter Biden’s lucrative role on Burisma’s board, he raised his concerns with the vice president’s office. The top State Department official testified over the course of President Donald Trump’s impeachment hearings that his discomfort about the situation was brushed off by the administration.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition in October last year. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

State Department officials, according to the Senate report, widely viewed Zlochevsky as a corrupt, “odious oligarch” who Kent described as “a poster child for corrupt behavior.”

“I would have advised any American not to get on the board of Zlochevsky’s company,” Kent said, telling colleagues in 2016 Zlochevsky “almost certainly paid off the [prosecutors] in December 2014.”

Vice President Joe Biden however, refused to launch accusations of corruption against Zlochevsky.

“The committees were not able to locate any public statements Vice President Biden gave from 2014 to 2016 in which he called Zlochevsky corrupt,” Senate investigators wrote in the joint report.

Instead, a Biden spokesperson told reporters, “the vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company.”

The Senate’s report marks the first phase of revelations to emerge from the probe launched in 2017, long before Joe Biden jumped into the crowded presidential race in the spring of 2019.

In a desperate bid to shut down the investigation out of concern that its findings could harm their attempt at the White House in November, Democrats, true to form, repeatedly attacked the ongoing probe as an instrument of Russian interference in the upcoming U.S. election, accusing Republican senators of being Kremlin agents.

Even Democrats on the committees attempted to undermine the Republican-led probe by leaking selected material to the same press that suddenly began re-characterizing the ongoing three-year investigation as a political weapon being wielded against the Biden campaign once it was clear that the former vice president was going to capture the Democratic nomination.

Multiple letter requests prior to Biden’s March Super Tuesday victories show, however, that the probe aimed to wrap up much sooner before the pandemic-related shutdowns and a partisan impeachment distracted the government from its oversight work and the coronavirus brewing overseas.

Byron York's 'Obsession' Uncovers The Plot To Impeach Trump,"Author Byron York’s writing room—and perhaps his brain—must look like a trapdoor spider’s nest with a thick webwork of connections, characters, plots, subplots, reveals, twists, reversals, turns, and counterturns. Yet in “Obsession: Inside the Washington Establishment’s Never-Ending War on Trump,” York’s chronicle of the partisan maneuvering to remove Trump from the presidency from 2016 to 2019, he delivers a cogent, complete, and surprisingly lucid (given the subject) account.

He does so by simply telling the story and letting the weirdness and complexity develop as his tale unfolds. Since York has covered the matter from day one in his position as a chief political correspondent at the Washington Examiner, perhaps all he really needed to do was pull out notes, jog his memory, and start writing.

York’s theme is that collusion, impeachment, bribery — all of it — was an arabesque. There was never any “there” there. Yet Democrats could not let it go.

J. Edgar Comey

Many may have forgotten some of the surreal details of the journey. York places the origin of the Democratic obsession on election night at Hillary Clinton HQ in Brooklyn, where it slowly dawned on the gathered faithful that the ceiling full of shattered-glass-shaped confetti would have to stay in the rafters, and their certainty of victory due to moral superiority was the only thing that would be broken that evening.

The ugly and strange Electoral College certification role call in January 2017 is another detail that may be lost in the smoke for some. As York reminds us, none other than Vice President Joe Biden presided over the formal certification of Trump as president. During the Trump roll call, House Democrat after House Democrat stood up and made objection to electoral totals. All were out of order, and Biden had to shut them down. Trump was certified.

As Republicans applauded, Biden turned to shake [House Speaker Paul] Ryan’s hand and said, ‘God save the Queen.’ It was unclear precisely what he meant, but it seemed to be a mild joke to ease the tension of one of the strangest Electoral College certifications ever.

Republicans should have taken this omen to heart, but did not. Yet.

A successful operation of smoke and mirrors starts with the set-up. This role was performed by a previous master of this dance, FBI Director James Comey. York provides a useful reminder that Comey was directly behind the appointment of special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, who looked into the so-called Valerie Plame outing as a CIA employee during the George W. Bush years, an investigation that sent the second-term Bush White House into conniptions.

“[Trump’s] instincts were that Comey was no good,” says York. But Trump believed he could eventually win him over. Comey was likewise wary of Trump because he feared Trump would suspect he was trying to behave like J. Edgar Hoover and hold information over him for leverage. “Trump might make that assumption because that was exactly what Comey was doing,” York comments.

Comey was fishing for any kind of legally actionable statement from Trump. When he didn’t get anything, he moved to the Rube Goldberg apparatus known as “Crossfire Hurricane.” It was through this operation and its use of the spurious and ridiculous Steele dossier (a folder of alleged personal dirt on Trump provided by an ex-British spy who was employed, through a cut-out law firm, by the Hilary Clinton campaign) that Comey set his trap.

“Trump’s classic businessman approach caused him to repeatedly misjudge the intentions of rivals in Washington, especially in the critical early months of his presidency,” says York. If he’d fired Comey sooner, Crossfire Hurricane might have died in its own poisonous juices, and we all might have been spared making the acquaintance of the likes of the FBI’s Peter Strzok, James Rybicki, Andrew McCabe, and Lisa Page and DOJ attorney James A. Baker — and most of all, that twist of human barbwire made of equal strands narcissism, megalomania, and namby-pamby-existentialism, James Comey.

One doesn’t simply fire James Comey, however. Like the creature in “Alien,” he keeps coming back. Comey forwarded a series of memos that he had essentially written to himself during early 2017 to a friend with media connections, who promptly leaked them. These seven memos outlined the accusations against Trump and the hall of mirrors Comey constructed regarding the case for “Russian collusion.” Their purpose was to trigger the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, which is exactly what happened.

Fortune Favors the Innocent

At this point, York introduces his heroes. This is the dogged, nondescript group of White House lawyers who mounted the response to the Mueller probe and, later, the Ukraine impeachment. York reveals that, while they may not be geniuses or divas (with the exception — on the diva end of things — of Rudy Giuliani, who joined later in the process), they had one big strength and they capitalized on it at every turn: the fact that, despite what the legal thrillers may say, it is far, far easier to defend an innocent man.

These lawyers included Mark Kasowitz, Michael Bowe, Jay Sekulow, James Quarles, Ty Cobb, John Dowd, and in 2018, Giuliani, and husband and wife team Marty and Jane Raskin. York gives the legal team character development worthy of a novel, as circumstance and reversals slowly force them to face their understandable naivete and adapt.

For a sea change had come to the American left, and Democrats had become the political version of religious zealots. Like zealots throughout history, they just would not let their obsession go. Quoting Dowd, York writes:

‘We said, ‘look, we kept our end,’ ’ Dowd recalled telling Mueller, ‘Are you going to hold up your end?’ ’ The next moment marked an enormous change in the course of the investigation. ‘Well, you know, if we’re going to square our corners,’ Mueller replied, according to Dowd, ‘we ought to really talk to the president.’

For the White House team, phase two of the legal battle, the attempt to “square the corners,” was about wary defense of a strong position. There had been sharing and transparency. There was no case for obstruction of justice, and no reason for the president to submit to hours of legal grilling. In the end, Mueller’s team caved and sent written questions, whose extreme complexity and specificity gave a taste of the ambush that would have been in store for the president.

Another key theme of York’s account is the reluctant realization by the White House lawyers that Mueller was in physical and mental decline. He’d hired 13 lawyers who were stated Democrats. None of the Mueller team were Republicans. People thought this might be corrected with the straight-shooting Mueller in charge.

But Mueller was not in charge of anything. York presents evidence from early Trump team spokesman and public relations expert Mark Corallo, who knew Mueller from a previous job.

‘I said to [Mueller team member] Andrew Goldstein, ‘Hey, how’s he doing?’ They said great. I said, ‘Well, he looks a little gaunt. Is he eating? Is he tired?’ They said, ‘No, he’s running circles around us.’ This was the first time I noticed that he was not physically robust.’ Nearly a year and a half later, watching Mueller testify on television, Corallo was taken aback. ‘When I saw him testifying, it was significantly more apparent,’ he recalled. “And trust me, I was not the only one.’

Over the course of 2017 and early 2018, the president’s legal team pieced together a series of clues that Mueller had checked out. While at first maddening, the White House lawyers ultimately realized that they had been handed the game. “[A] bunch of scumbags were running the operation,” as Giuliani put it.

Again, the White House team had the one ace up their sleeve to beat all others: their man had done nothing wrong. In the end, there was no collusion. Although the final report did not categorically exonerate Trump from obstruction, there was nothing on which to hang a congressional impeachment trial. The Democratic humiliation was complete. But zealots don’t give up in the face of mere rationality.

York serves up the Ukraine impeachment saga to serve as a tragi-comic denouement. It is clear from York’s reporting that, whatever the identity of the “whistleblower,” the Ukrainian flap was all Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from start to finish.

The entire House impeachment rested on the delusions of grandeur of one jumped-up National Security Council bureaucrat, a supposed expert on Ukraine, his talk of “interagency consensus” as cringe-inducing and cloying as the Reverend Casaubon’s obsession with his “Key to All Mythologies” in “Middlemarch.” Yet again, there was no “there” there. York reminds us, “the President of the United States is simply not subject to any whistleblower laws.”

York gives us pointillist portraits of impeachment actors Rep. Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff. He reminds us of perhaps the oddest and most prescient reporting of the past four years, as well. This is Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway’s remarkable account of sitting near Nadler on the Acela train in November 2018, where she overheard Nadler loudly speaking into a cellphone about his plan to destroy Trump now that Democrats controlled the House.

Nadler was so loud Hemingway could take notes verbatim. Her report is both hilarious and horrifying. (In fact, considering how many Pulitzers have been handed out to dozens of undeserving idiots, hacks, and toadies over the past few years, Hemingway’s keen reporting is a reminder that of the old adage that good luck is when opportunity meets preparedness.) In the end, Nadler proved incompetent at putting his plans into action, and House Democrats sidelined him for the Mephistophelean Schiff.

Swamp Creatures

With a steady drumbeat of factual, piece-by-piece storytelling, York captures the Chautauqua of sleaze and venality that has overtaken official Washington for the past four years in this, the greatest ongoing emanation of meaningless sound and fury in U.S. political history. It was a plot hatched by a comprehensive assortment of all the monstrous personalities in which the capital specializes: schemers, narcissists, and zealots, sure, but also the monomaniacally insane, the gutlessly obsequious, and, most of all, the overblown and hyperextended of ego.

In short, those who may have been people once, but have whittled themselves down to mere psychotic nubs, personas, corrupt freaks possessed of souls with the size and consistency of a mildewed ear — and all these behavioral mutants bathing in, absorbing their sustenance from, a miasmic slough of verbal pus spewed forth by a nattering, nattering, forever nattering horde of sideline-sitting SAT progenies, beard-tugging sophists, vitriolic fops, and cheese-brained shawties gussied up in meaningless degrees, chemical tans, pancake makeup, and whitened teeth looking like corpses attending their own funerals.

During that time, some Democrats worked themselves into a seemingly permanent state of hysteria over Russia. There was breathless (and endless) discussion of each new revelation out of the Mueller probe. There were serious people who, with a straight face, called the president a Russian agent. There were serious people who accused him of treason. There were serious people who believed the allegations in the Steele dossier. Reason, proportion, and critical thinking virtually disappeared from the daily debate.

York tells the story with no polemic. He doesn’t need it. All he has to do is illustrate the fact that there was no evidence supporting the great plot to bring down President Donald Trump.

This is the salient fact to which York returns time and again in this nuanced, complex, and remarkably complete account of the mania that overtook not only the political far left, but the Democratic Party, and quite a few bureaucratic operatives in their attempt to remove a U.S. president from office, and possibly see him to prison. Unfortunately, it is a mania that is far from spent.

Senate's Report On Biden Exposes Absurdity Of Trump's Impeachment,"It was this time last year that House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump after all prior efforts to overturn the results of the 2016 election failed.

The drawn-out head-hunt from the same party promising to impeach the president since before inauguration finally centered on a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It was during this conversation that an anonymous whistleblower, eventually identified by Real Clear Investigations as Eric Ciaramella, an Obama White House holdover on the National Security Council, accused Trump of demanding his Ukrainian counterpart launch a series of investigations into the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in military aid in a claimed quid pro quo.

Democrats and legacy media, desperate to resurrect charges of foreign corruption against the president several months after the collapse of the Russia hoax, immediately capitalized on the complaint. The hysterical news coverage provoked the White House to take the extraordinary step of releasing the transcript of the phone call in question, an unprecedented move potentially upending relations with Ukraine and risking the mistrust of world leaders about engaging in candid conversations with the president over fears that their discussions too could be revealed.

The grand revelation from its release? That the American president urged the leader of one of the world’s most notoriously corrupt countries to rid his government of corruption and to investigate Ukraine’s peddling of the Russian hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States. That’s the “high crime and misdemeanor” for which the president was impeached.

Democrats and their allies in the complicit media, however, concentrated outrage over the president’s mention of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board for upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while his father served as the Obama administration’s “public face” for handling Ukraine. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s Burisma pay shows the former vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation that dwarfed the earnings of other board executives in the same field.

True to form, CNN, The New York Times, and the Washington Post deceptively edited portions of the transcript to fit the Democrat narrative that the president requested a “favor” from the Ukrainian leader that featured launching a foreign investigation into Trump’s political opponents centered on Burisma, when a clear and honest reading of the transcript illustrated nothing of the sort. Here’s what the president said when using the word “favor” to request that the Ukrainian president uncover his government’s role in the Russia hoax:

I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… the server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you and your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Here’s what the president said 540 words later:

There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.

In 2018, Joe Biden indeed bragged about his role in ousting the Ukrainian prosecutor with plans to investigate his son’s company by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if the vice president’s demands were not met. Did Joe Biden, then, engage in a quid pro quo to save his son’s lucrative overseas sinecure?

Democrats, however, treated Republican scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s suspicious overseas business activity as a red herring intended to distract from the supposed seditious actions of the president. Democrats refused to even allow Hunter Biden to testify in the House or Senate.

“We don’t need to have witnesses that have nothing to do with this that are trying to distract Americans from the truth,” scoffed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Hunter Biden, California Rep. Adam Schiff said, was “irrelevant and immaterial.” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen called Hunter Biden a “total sideshow.”

These comments were made even after the American public knew of Hunter Biden’s overpaid board position and his father’s pressure campaign to stop investigations into his son’s firm.

A new earthshattering report released by Senate investigators Wednesday, however, reveals the Biden family’s long series of conflicts of interest while serving at the upper echelons of government go far deeper than previously known.

The report, unveiled by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with the Senate Treasury Committee and led by Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, shows Hunter Biden engaged in a wide array of potentially criminal transactions that also includes Joe Biden’s brother, James Biden, expanding the network of conflicting interests in the Biden family beyond Hunter that raised concerns of extortion.

According to Senate investigators, Hunter Biden helped invest millions of Chinese capital on American soil following a government trip with his vice president father to Beijing aboard Air Force Two in 2013. Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners, the report says, held deep ties with the Chinese Communist Party.

In 2018, the same individuals linked to the Chinese Communist Party funded a more than $100,000 shopping spree for Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James’ wife, Sara, featuring extravagant purchases from airplane tickers to Apple products. The transactions, the committee wrote, were flagged for potential criminal activity.

In Ukraine, the Senate found that Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky, widely viewed as a corrupt, “odious oligarch,” is accused of paying a $7 million bribe to Ukrainian officials to shut down an investigation of the firm.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told committee staff that the FBI was informed of Zlochevsky’s alleged bribe and then later learned of Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with Zlochevsky’s company. Kent described Zlochevsky as “a poster child for corrupt behavior.” Kent, the administration’s top official on Ukraine, told lawmakers that he raised his concerns over Hunter Biden’s overseas role with White House staff, who dismissed them.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition during House impeachment proceedings in October. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

In Russia, Hunter Biden was found by Senate investigators to have received a $3.5 million payment in 2014 from the wife of a former Moscow mayor who had been fired by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev four years earlier based on charges of corruption. Hunter Biden is also accused by Senate investigators of making payments to Eastern European hookers who may be linked to a sex trafficking ring.

One can easily imagine the kind of press coverage there would have been this week had Donald Trump Jr. been caught displaying any of Hunter Biden’s growing series of alleged misconduct. Would Trump Jr. be called to testify before Congress? Would Democrats again resurrect their theories of collusion? Would they launch a second impeachment?

The entire Democrat rebuttal to Republican objections over impeachment was predicated on Hunter Biden’s innocence. They said the president had no reason to mention the former vice president’s son other than to score political points. Wednesday’s Senate report, however, detailing an expansive series of potentially criminal conduct that jeopardized U.S. interests, shows Democrats were the ones initiating a cover-up.

What Did Joe Biden Know About His Family's Financial Ties To China?,"Given the grave threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), especially near an election and in an era in which fears of foreign influence are at an all-time high, one might think revelations about the family of Democratic nominee Joe Biden cashing in on Communist China while he was vice president might be a “big [expletive] deal,” in the cellar-dwelling candidate’s words.

Yet the media and political class have completely blacked out these newly released facts. This was on display during the first presidential debate when Biden and moderator Chris Wallace called a “lid” on it.

Biden Family Secrets Exposed

The joint Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Finance Committee report on Hunter Biden’s business dealings with foreign powers, and their relation to U.S. government policy during the Obama-Biden administration, states the following:

Hunter Biden has extensive connections to Chinese businesses and Chinese foreign nationals that are linked to the Communist government. Those contacts bore financial fruit when his father was vice president and after he left office.

These ties went beyond the former vice president’s son. The report adds: “The records acquired by the Committees show consistent, significant and extensive financial connections among and between Hunter Biden, James Biden, Sara Biden … and Chinese nationals connected to the Communist regime and PLA as well as other foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds.”

The joint investigation details a stunning array of transactions that “paint a mosaic of the complex corporate structure that existed between entities linked to Hunter Biden, his associates, and his family and Chinese companies linked to the Communist government.” Many of the transactions were flagged for “potential financial criminal activity.” Such activity enriched Hunter Biden to the tune of millions of dollars.

As vice president of the United States, Joe Biden had an absolute obligation to know what his family members were up to, disclose it, and end it. This is not just because of the potential for corruption, but the myriad ways his family’s acts could imperil American national security. Indeed, as the report concludes, the dealings between the Biden family and China don’t merely “raise conflicts of interest concerns, they raise criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns.”

A Free Pass from Democrats and the Media

The unseemly reality of Hunter Biden enriching himself through positions for which he appears to lack any qualification other than his family name is the least of the issues here. Far more significant is that the loved ones of a high-ranking politician had deep financial interests with foreign adversaries, presenting a nightmare scenario in terms of the potential for exploitation.

If Joe Biden were seeking a security clearance, most everything in the Senate committee report and more would have to be reported. Presumably, these disclosures would imperil his odds of receiving one.

Since he is a candidate, it is up to the American people to do this vetting. This is why it was particularly troublesome that during the first presidential debate, he got a free pass on these issues. Twice, Hunter Biden’s connections with adversarial powers came up. The first time, the former vice president ignored President Donald Trump’s assertion about the unique investment opportunities Hunter exploited, seemingly based on his father’s dealings with Beijing.

The second time, the exchange went like this:

Trump: Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow, and various other places.

Biden: That is not true.

Trump: He made a fortune, and he didn’t have a job. … Why was he given tens of millions of dollars?

Biden: He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk] It was all discredited.

Wallace: We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.

Trump: I know, but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow.

Biden: That is not true. That report is totally discredited.

Trump: Why did he get it?

Biden: Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayers’ money. That report was written for political reasons.

Wallace: I’d like to talk about climate change.

Biden: So would I.

Does anything better depict the gap between Washington and real America than this back-and-forth?

Biden’s Record with China

Joe Biden cannot be allowed to shrug this off with a “C’mon man,” as he has in the past with respect to his son’s Ukrainian dalliances and their relation to the Obama-Biden administration’s Ukraine policy, the troubling centerpiece of the joint Senate committee report.

He has to be straight with the American people about what he knew about his family’s China business, when he knew it, what he did about it, and how it might have affected his duties and responsibilities. This is all especially important since Biden was the man in charge of the Obama administration’s China portfolio. If Biden truly was in the dark regarding these links, that is disturbing. If he knowingly concealed them, all the more so.

Over the course of his time in Washington, Biden has helped guide American foreign policy at the highest levels, first as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and then as vice president. What accentuates the disturbing nature of these revelations about his family is the fact that throughout his career, Biden cheered China’s rise.

Joe Biden supported granting China permanent normal trade relations and the communist country’s accession to the World Trade Organization. Over and over, he served as an avatar of the political establishment’s integrationist and accommodationist approach to China, helping turn it into a global superpower. All along, he claimed this was good for America, even saying it wouldn’t threaten the livelihoods of American workers.

Biden helped make Communist China strong — again, while his family directly profited from it when he was in office — cultivating a relationship with Xi Jinping. The Obama-Biden administration was remarkably soft on China over its most grievous provocations, whether in terms of the catastrophic Office of Personnel Management hack, the militarization of the South China Sea, or its flouting of U.S. capital market regulations with impunity, gaining the imprimatur of the administration after lobbying Biden to ink a memorandum of understanding effectively normalizing its cheating.

Where Are the Russia Collusion-Mongers?

Meanwhile, even today, with Biden forced to toughen his rhetoric about China for the first time in his life — largely thanks to an opponent in Trump, who has engaged in an unprecedented effort to comprehensively confront the Chinese Communist Party — Biden still can only manage to call China a “serious competitor.” He dubs Russia, by contrast, an “opponent.” This is laughable given how much bigger, stronger, richer, and more dangerous is the former.

This raises another question: Where are the Russiagate collusion-mongers on Biden and China? Leave aside that the joint Senate report asserts that Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire from the wife of Moscow’s former mayor, who had allegedly received illegal construction contracts from her husband. Also ignore for a moment that Hunter allegedly sent thousands of dollars to Ukrainian and Russian citizens involved in the sex industry, some transactions of which might have been associated with an “Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.” Why are the collusion-mongers silent about China?

By their silence and inaction, the collusion-mongers tell us they never actually cared about foreign influence, or at very best only cared about it as a political weapon. It was never about the merits. It was always about power. Part of that power concerned maintaining the China status quo from which the political establishment had so richly profited, and which the Trump administration has since upended.

We now know the extent to which the Biden family was a beneficiary of that China status quo. So once again, we must ask: What did Joe Biden know, and when did he know it?

Biden In-Law Advising Campaign While He Could Profit Off Covid Policies,"The growing web of conflicts of interest surrounding the Biden family stretches far beyond the potentially criminal overseas business activity conducted by the former vice president’s son and brother.

According to a new report from Politico published Tuesday, ethics experts are raising eyebrows at Biden son-in-law’s health care start ups capitalizing on the coronavirus pandemic while Joe Biden remains within a three-week striking distance of capturing the White House.

Howard Krein, the paper reported, who married Biden’s daughter, Ashley, in 2012, is advising the Democratic nominee’s presidential campaign while simultaneously investing in health care start-ups that could be on the other end of receiving billions in government pandemic spending.

In April, Krein’s investment firm, StartUP Health, announced it would be sending $1 million to 10 startups working on the coronavirus pandemic after Krein was reported by Bloomberg and the New York Times to be participating in daily calls with the Democratic candidate advising him on public health.

“StartUp Health is putting the full support of its platform and network behind building a post-Covid world that uses technology and entrepreneurial ingenuity to improve health outcomes,” the company wrote in an April statement.

StartUp Health was launched in 2011, a year after Krein began dating Biden’s daughter. The firm, which has invested in more than 300 health care businesses and enjoyed a close relationship with the Obama White House, even prominently employs the same “Moonshot” terminology to describe its goals as employed by the former vice president in starting the Cancer Moonshot initiative.

Avik Roy, who founded his own investment firm named Roy Healthcare Research, said Krein’s close access to the potential president on its own is likely to court big-money interest.

“I have little doubt that the relationship to Joe Biden, particularly if he becomes president, would attract the interest of some investors,” Roy told Politico, adding that the relationship could also land Krein’s firm stakes in competitive startups.

“People who are plugged in have an advantage, and that is a common feature of a lot of heavily regulated industries,” Roy told the paper.

Politico reported that existing ethics concerns are amplified by StartUp Health’s foreign investments from Swiss and Chinese firms.

A spokesperson for the Biden campaign simply pointed Politico to an earlier statement playing down Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when contacted by the magazine questioning Krein’s conflicts of interest.

“I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period,” Biden said in South Carolina. “And what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration.”

However, consequent revelations unearthed earlier this year illustrated that Biden’s office knew more than what was reported last year about Hunter Biden’s overseas business activity that set off red flags within the State Department and the Justice Department.

According to a Senate report chronicling the Biden family’s conflicts of interest while Joe Biden served as vice president, the owner of Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board raking in excess compensation, allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to Ukrainian officials to shut down a government investigation.

Upon learning of the illegal payment, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told Senate investigators that the Ukraine embassy’s DOJ official relayed the information to the FBI. Congressional lawmakers, who have since requested information from the federal law enforcement agency, were stonewalled from any information on a FBI possible probe. The FBI maintained that it was against agency protocol to either confirm or deny the existence of any such investigation despite freely commenting on the deep-state coordinated Russia Hoax against President Donald Trump.

Kent had also raised his concerns over Hunter Biden’s lucrative role in Ukraine with Biden’s White House office but was dismissed by the vice president’s staff.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition in October during the impeachment proceedings last year. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time … That was the end of that conversation.”

The long-anticipated Senate report last month also expanded the Biden family’s conflicts of interest to Joe Biden’s brother, James. According to the report, Chinese businessmen engaged with the Biden family’s overseas ventures provided Hunter, James, and James’ wife Sara Biden with a line of credit where the family went on a more than $100,000 shopping spree to purchase extravagant items from airplane tickets to Apple products.

Senate investigators have flagged the transaction as potential financial criminal activity.

Emails Show Joe Biden Lied About His Knowledge Of Hunter's Foreign Business Interests,"Newly discovered email correspondence between Hunter Biden and a Ukrainian adviser to the energy company Burisma reveal that former Vice President Joe Biden was lying when he repeatedly denied knowledge of his son’s involvement in “overseas business dealings.”

The emails, which were found on a computer left at a Delaware repair shop and obtained by the New York Post, show that Hunter introduced his father to Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma adviser, less than one year before the elder Biden lobbied for the firing of a prosecutor who had investigated the company.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Pozharskyi wrote.

Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014 while his father was in the White House. Hunter was paid upwards of $50,000 per month, a shockingly high salary for his non-existent experience in the energy sector.

In 2019, Joe Biden told Fox News, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

A few months later, Axios’ Mike Allen asked Biden what his understanding was of what Hunter was doing for an extraordinary amount of money.

“I don’t know what he was doing,” Biden said. “I know he was on the board. I found out he was on the board after he was on the board, and that was it.”

In February this year, when NBC’s Savannah Guthrie pressed Biden on whether it was appropriate for his son to take the Burisma board position, Biden lashed out, saying, “Well that’s not true. You’re saying things you do not know what you’re talking about.”

The New York Post’s reporting shows that Joe Biden was not only aware of his son’s work with Burisma but was actively meeting with the company’s adviser while also actively working to advance a foreign policy agenda in Ukraine as vice president. In 2018, Biden bragged about “threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a pressure tactic to force the firing of a prosecutor he did not like.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/14/new-emails-show-joe-biden-lied-about-his-knowledge-of-his-sons-foreign-business-interests/,2020-10-14
FLASHBACK: Joe Biden Fat-Shamed Voter Who Questioned Hunter's Deals,"Joe Biden fat-shamed an Iowa voter in December during a town hall when the man challenged the Democratic presidential candidate on his son’s lucrative board position with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

“We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine… but, you on the other hand, sent your son over there. He not only worked for a gas company, but he had no experience in … You’re selling access to the presidency just like [Trump] is,” said the Iowa voter.

“You’re a damn liar, man,” Biden pushed back.

“I saw it on TV,” the man responded.

“You see it on TV? No, I know you do. By the way, that’s why I’m not sedentary. I get up,” Biden said, going on to challenge the man to a push-up competition. “Let’s do push-ups together, man. Let’s run.”

As the two men engaged, Biden vehemently denied wrongdoing, dismissing the attendee’s concerns with “Look, fat, here’s the deal,” before being interrupted.

Ten months later, and after Biden’s repeated denials that he held intimate knowledge of his son’s potentially criminal overseas business activity (here, here, here), the New York Post published emails contradicting the former vice president’s prior claims that he never talked business with his son “or with anyone else.”

According to emails obtained by the Post, Joe Biden indeed met with a Ukrainian consultant for Burisma in a meeting that was set up by his son, Hunter. Hunter Biden was serving on the company board with upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation despite no prior experience in the industry. At the time, Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s “public face” of White House policy towards Ukraine.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” the Ukrainian advisor, Vadym Pozharskyi, wrote.

Not too long after the meeting, Joe Biden pressured for the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating that same firm.

The New Yorker’s Hunter Biden Whitewash Looks Awful In Retrospect,"It is almost as if the New Yorker prepared for this moment.

In early July of 2019, just more than two months after former Vice President Joe Biden kicked off his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the magazine published a more than 10,000 word piece attempting to whitewash misconduct by the candidate’s troubled son, Hunter.

The article chronicled Hunter Biden’s upbringing, a senator’s son as a sympathetic figure who has struggled with heartbreak and addiction while, unlike many children of prominent politicians, still had to work part-time jobs in college to make ends meet. Most striking about the New Yorker essay however, was its explicit attempts to get ahead of a news cycle prophesied by the eventual Democratic nominee’s son himself.

Here is the fourth paragraph of the feature-length profile:

Donald J. Trump and some of his allies, in their eagerness to undermine Biden’s candidacy, and possibly to deflect attention from their own ethical lapses, have gone to extreme lengths, promoting, without evidence, the dubious narrative that Biden used the office of the Vice President to advance and protect his son’s interests.

Later, the piece continued to forecast what the next few months would look like, which would also ultimately feature Democrats going nuclear – all the way to a six-month impeachment trial while the coronavirus brewed overseas – to deter any real investigation of Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings. Democrats would even charge a Senate investigation launched in 2017 by Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa as Russian interference, a favorite and increasingly familiar line of attack based on nothing more than a political motivation to merely link “Russia” with “Republican” in the same sentence. After all, a considerable population remains absolutely convinced that the president sits in the Oval Office operating as a Russian agent as a consequence of a four-year media campaign to legitimize the Democratic conspiracy.

“Through weeks of conversations, [Hunter] became increasingly open about his setbacks, aware that many of the stories that he told me would otherwise emerge, likely in a distorted form, in Breitbart or on ‘Hannity,'” the New Yorker piece read.

He wanted to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures, and to share a personal narrative that he sees no reason to hide. ‘Look, everybody faced pain,’ he said. ‘Everybody has trauma. There’s addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel – it’s a never-ending tunnel. You don’t get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.

Of course new revelations taking focus on Hunter Biden’s personal impropriety would indeed come out. Just several months later, Lunden Alexis Roberts, an Arkansas woman mentioned in the piece suing Hunter Biden for child support would win her case against the son of the Democratic presidential frontrunner. Roberts was a stripper at a D.C. strip club that Hunter Biden reportedly frequented. And last month, Hunter Biden was accused by Senate investigators of making payments to eastern European hookers who may have been victims of sex trafficking. And on Wednesday, the New York Post published that among the incriminating materials found on a Delaware computer include “a raunchy 12-minute video” appearing to show Hunter “smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman,” in addition to “other sexually explicit images.”

Casting Hunter Biden as a sympathetic survivor of addiction to get out in front of the subsequent stories on his personal life that would emerge, did emerge, and continue to emerge, would constitute only half the article’s preemptive protection.

A recurring theme throughout the profile was Hunter Biden’s apparent commitment to consistently recuse himself from his own priorities in order to protect his father from holding appearances of conflicts of interest. Hunter Biden refrained from early lobbying gigs that involved his father serving in the Senate. He resigned from his unpaid role at Amtrak when his father ran ran for vice president in 2008. He would tell clients that he could no longer represent them upon election.

The article even addressed Hunter Biden’s foreign trip to China in 2013, where he flew aboard Air Force Two with his vice president father while building a private equity firm.

Hunter Biden used the platform offered in the New Yorker to dismiss criticism of the trip showing a conflict of interest as merely mingling with close associates. Senate investigators would later point out that Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners held strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party who lawmakers accused Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden’s brother James of engaging in criminal financial activity with.

“How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?” Hunter Biden said at the time.

On Thursday, the New York Post broke another blockbuster story showing that Hunter Biden stood to rake in $10 million a year for “introductions alone,” from Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC). Ye, the Senate report showed last month, formerly held positions with the People’s Liberation Army.

The New Yorker also addressed Hunter Biden’s role on the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, playing down the apparent conflict of interest presented with Joe Biden playing a “central role” in dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

“Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a ‘private citizen,'” the paper wrote, including additional testimony from administration officials that Hunter Biden’s position was of little concern. “Hunter told Burisma’s management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father.”

For the next 15 months, Joe Biden would repeatedly deny that he spoke about business with his son as more revelations surrounding the questionable arrangement would surface over the course of the campaign.

“I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period,” Biden said in August last year.

On Wednesday however, the bombshell story from the New York Post would show that was not true. According to emails obtained by the paper, Hunter Biden had in fact introduced a top advisor for Burisma to Joe Biden. While the Biden campaign initially denied any such meeting took place, Politico later reported Wednesday night that the campaign “would not rule out the possibility that the former VP had some kind of interaction,” with his son’s Ukrainian business associate.

Further, several top State Department officials were very concerned about Hunter Biden’s board position in Ukraine.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine testified during House impeachment proceedings that he had called the vice president’s office upon learning of Hunter Biden’s lucrative gig but was dismissed by White House staff.

“The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation,” Kent said.

"The Biden Corruption Scandal Isn’t About Hunter, It’s About Joe","Hunter Biden’s addiction is not the issue. Joe Biden’s addiction is: His addiction to power and money. And it is the evidence of the former vice president’s corruption, and the national security risk our country would face by electing Biden, that is the story of the MacBook hard drive, not the salacious, verified photographs and videos of Hunter Biden.

For nearly a week, corporate media successfully ignored or downplayed news of the trove of Hunter Biden’s emails, texts, photographs, and videos recovered from a laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store. Then confirmation of the authenticity of the materials first reported in the New York Post, and the release of a second set of emails — also confirmed— from another source finally forced the press to acknowledge the issue.

On Friday evening, CBS News’ Bo Erickson asked Joe Biden about the New York Post story as the Democrat candidate for president departed from a campaign stop in Michigan. “I have no response. It’s another smear campaign — right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask,” Biden snipped at the long-time reporter.

With more details coming out daily, this non-answer will not placate even a compliant press for long. Nor will the “Russia disinformation” narrative pushed by Biden’s media boosters suffice because multiple confirmations of the evidence establish this story is not disinformation.

It’s Not about Hunter’s Addiction, It’s about Joe’s

So, the dissembling will start, with Biden attempting to make the story about his son’s drug addiction. We already saw this when President Trump hit his opponent during the first presidential debate with the fact that once Biden “became vice president [Hunter] made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.” Biden’s first response was outright denial: “That is not true.” But that won’t work with the constantly accumulating evidence from the hard drive and the other independent emails.

So Biden’s second tack will likely be his campaign’s official response once they regroup over the weekend: “My son, like a lot of people at home, had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son,” Biden punched back during the first presidential debate.

Wisely, President Trump ignored the misdirection, replying, “But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?” “Moderator” Chris Wallace rescued Biden by interjecting, “We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.”

Senate Report Confirms Corruption

While Hunter Biden’s highly lucrative position on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma has received some press, the media all but ignored the U.S. Senate committee report on “Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.” This report not only details “examples of extensive and complex financial transactions involving the Bidens, it also describes the quandary other U.S. governmental officials faced as they attempted to guide and support Ukraine’s anticorruption efforts.”

The report’s key findings included concerns raised by “officials in Vice President Joe Biden’s office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board,” and a senior State Department official’s warning to Vice President Biden or his staff “that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.” The report also confirmed that former Secretary of State John Kerry “had knowledge of Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board,” even though he falsely denied that knowledge during a town hall event in 2019.

The report was not limited to Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board and the Obama-Biden administration’s knowledge of that conflict of interest. The Senate committees also detailed Hunter’s receipt of “a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow,” and Hunter’s opening of “a bank account with Gongwen Dong to fund a $100,000 global spending spree with James Biden and Sara Biden,” as well as his “business associations with Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People’s Liberation Army.”

“Those associations,” the report continued, “resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow,” some of which Hunter “paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an ‘Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.’”

Whistleblower Turns Over Hunter’s Laptop

Then on Saturday, we learned from a letter sent by Sen. Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to FBI Director Christopher Wray, that the report triggered “a whistleblower” to contact Johnson’s “committee and informed [his] staff that he had possession of a laptop left in his business by Hunter Biden,” clearly the same source as behind the New York Post’s story.

The letter continued: “He also informed us that he provided its contents to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in response to a December 9, 2019 grand jury subpoena.” The FBI refused to confirm any or deny any information sought by the committee, including questions unrelated to ongoing grand jury investigations. Johnson stressed the importance of the FBI responding to the committee’s inquiry: “I have a responsibility to validate and verify the contents of any information produced to my committee. The committee must know if it receives information that could be fraudulent or not accurate.”

“For example,” Johnson’s letter continued, “if any information offered to the committee was linked to a foreign adversary’s attempt to interfere in the election, I would expect the FBI to ensure the committee is protected and receives a defensive briefing.” Additionally, as Johnson noted, “knowingly providing false information to Congress is a crime.” Johnson then listed a litany of questions concerning the laptop and the FBI’s efforts to verify the authenticity of the material, asking for an answer by Oct. 22, 2020.

It seems unlikely the FBI will respond to the inquiry, or at least not publicly, but to date, several outlets are claiming they confirmed the validity of the emails and other material on the hard drive, and the personal texts and photographs and videos released leave little doubt that the hard drive truly was Hunter Biden’s.

This Is about Joe Biden, Not Hunter

That is the extent of the relevance of the personal information being released: The public does not need to know of the unsavory and illegal behavior Hunter engaged in—much less watch it—while he was in the throes of addiction. America also does not need to read the words of anguish exchanged between an addict son undergoing rehab and his famous father.

Yet Hunter Biden’s addiction, and the fact that tens of thousands of other Americans suffer similar demons, does not atone for the sins of the father. And that is what the email and text scandal concerns: Evidence that Joe Biden, while vice president of the United States, knowingly allowed his son to profit by selling access to Biden and others in the Obama administration, including to Communist Party of China leaders, and then lied about it.

The emails and texts Joe personally received also suggest a cut from Hunter’s influence-peddling. For instance, one email published by the New York Post detailed a deal Hunter Biden pursued with China’s largest private energy company that was “interesting for me and my family.”

A May 13, 2017 email with the subject line “Expectations” listed expected “renumeration packages” for various individuals, including “‘H,’ apparently referring to Biden.” The Post noted that “the deal also listed ‘10 Jim’ and ‘10 held by H for the big guy?’” but did not identify the “big guy.” However, sources have told Fox News “‘the big guy’ is a reference to the former vice president.”

A text recovered from the hard drive also suggests the former vice president may have received a cut of Hunter’s “earnings.” “I Hope you all cal do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family Fro 30 years,” a screenshot of a text from January 2019 to Hunter’s daughter read. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry unlike Pop I won’t make you give me half your salary.”

This Compromising Material Is a National Security Risk

Evidence of this scandal is too strong to ignore or to allow Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, or corporate media to cast aside as an unseemly attack on a recovering drug addict, and not merely because of the corruption at issue. Every country, every foreign politician or political faction, and every corrupt oligarch or business that paid for access has the emails, notes, receipts, itineraries, fund transfers, and maybe even photographs or recordings. And that makes Joe Biden a national security risk.

Remember, it was Acting Attorney General Sally Yates’ concern that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was a national security risk that sent her to the White House to get him fired. The Russians would know, she maintained, that Flynn had misrepresented to Vice President Mike Pence his conversations with the Russian ambassador, and that would leave Flynn compromised. Of course, that theory was so preposterous that even disgraced former FBI Director James Comey called it a stretch.

But there is a world of difference between a conversation among a transition team member and a foreign ambassador and a conversation between individuals with foreign interests and the former vice president, bought and paid for with cash funneled through his son. A compromise of that kind holds serious national security issues, which is why our country needs a full vetting of this evidence.

If the emails and texts are fake, we need to know that. But all indications to date are that they are real, and spectacularly damning. And that has nothing to do with Hunter Biden’s addiction, and everything to do with Joe Biden’s unfitness for office.

Joe Biden’s Boosters Financed His Prodigal Son’s Entire Career,"Hunter Biden profited from his father’s political connections long before he struck questionable deals in countries where Joe Biden was undertaking diplomatic missions as vice president. In fact, virtually all the jobs listed on his resume going back to his first position out of college, which paid a six-figure salary, came courtesy of the former six-term senator’s donors, lobbyists, and allies, a RealClearInvestigations examination has found.

One document reviewed by RCI reveals that a Biden associate admitted “finding employment” for Hunter Biden specifically as a special favor to his father, then a Senate leader running for president. He secured a $1.2 million gig on Wall Street for his young son, even though it was understood he had no experience in high finance. Many of his generous patrons, in turn, ended up with legislation and policies favorable to their businesses or investments, an RCI review of lobbying records and legislative actions taken by the elder Biden confirms.

That the 50-year-old Hunter has been trading on his Democratic father’s political influence his entire adult life raises legal questions about possible influence-peddling, government watchdogs and former federal investigators say. In addition, the more than two-decades-long pattern of nepotism casts fresh doubt on Joe Biden’s recent statements that he “never discussed” business with his son, and that his activities posed “no conflicts of interest.”

No fewer than three committees in the Republican-controlled Senate have opened probes into potential Biden family conflicts. Investigators are also poring over Treasury Department records that have flagged suspicious activities involving Hunter’s banking transactions and business deals that may be connected to his father’s political influence.

U.S. ethics rules require all government officials to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest in taking official actions. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.

While most of the attention on Hunter has focused on his dealings in Ukraine and China when his father was in the White House, he also cashed in on cushy jobs and sweetheart deals throughout his dad’s long Senate career, records reveal.

“Hunter Biden’s Ukraine-China connections are just one element of the Biden corruption story,” said Tom Fitton, president of the Washington-based watchdog group Judicial Watch, who contends Biden used both the Office of the Vice President and the Senate to advance his son’s personal interests.

In each case, Hunter Biden appeared under-qualified for the positions he obtained. All the while, he was a chronic abuser of alcohol and drugs, including crack cocaine, and has cycled in and out of no fewer than six drug-rehab treatment programs, according to published reports. He’s also been the subject of at least two drug-related investigations by police, one in 1988 and another in 2016, according to federal records and reports. A third drug investigation resulted in his discharge from the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2014.

This comprehensive account of Hunter Biden’s “unique career trajectory,” as one former family friend gently put it, was pieced together through interviews with more than a dozen people, several of whom insisted on anonymity to describe private conversations, and after an in-depth examination of public records, including Securities and Exchange Commission filings, court papers, campaign filings, federal lobbying disclosures, and congressional documents.

Hunter Biden’s resume begins 24 years ago. Here is a rundown of the plum positions he has managed to land since 1996, thanks to his politically connected father and his boosters:

1996-1998: MBNA Corp.

Fresh out of college, credit-card giant MBNA put him on its payroll as “senior vice president” earning more than $100,000 a year, plus an undisclosed signing bonus. Delaware-based MBNA at the time was Biden’s largest donor and lobbying the Delaware senator for bankruptcy reforms that would make it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy and write off credit-card debt.

Besides a job for Hunter, bank executives and employees gave generously to Joe Biden’s campaigns – $214,000 total, federal records show – and one top executive even bought Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, home for more than $200,000 above the market value, real estate records show. The exec paid top dollar – $1.2 million – for the old house even though it lacked central air conditioning. MBNA also flew Biden and his wife to events and covered their travel costs, disclosure forms show.

Sen. Biden eventually came through for MBNA by sponsoring and whipping votes in the Senate to pass the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention Act.

When NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw asked Biden during the 2008 presidential campaign whether it was wrong “for someone like you in the middle of all this to have your son collecting money from this big credit-card company while you were on the (Senate) floor protecting its interests,” Biden gave an answer he would repeat many times in the future: “Absolutely not,” he snapped, arguing it was completely appropriate and that Hunter deserved the position and generous salary because he graduated from Yale.

1998-2001: Commerce Department

Hunter also capitalized on the family name in 1998 when he joined President Clinton’s agency. In spite of having no experience in the dot-com industry, he was appointed “executive director of e-commerce policy coordination,” pulling down another six-figure salary plus bonuses.

He landed the job after his father’s longtime campaign manager and lawyer William Oldaker called then-Commerce Secretary William Daley, who’d also worked on Biden’s campaigns, and put in a good word for his son, according to public records.

2001-2009: Oldaker, Biden & Belair

After Republican President George W. Bush took over the Commerce Department, Hunter left the government and joined Oldaker to open a lobbying shop in Washington, just blocks from Congress, where he gained access to exclusive business and political deals.

Federal disclosure forms show Hunter Biden and his firm billed millions of dollars while lobbying on behalf of a host of hospitals and private colleges and universities, among other clients. In a 2006 disclosure statement submitted to the Senate, Hunter said his clients were “seeking federal appropriations dollars.”

Hunter won the contract to represent St. Joseph’s University from an old Biden family friend who worked in government relations at the university and proposed he solicit earmarks for one of its programs in Philadelphia. The friend, Robert Skomorucha, remarked in a press interview that Hunter had “a very strong last name that really paid off in terms of our lobbying efforts.”

These clients, like MBNA, also favored bankruptcy reforms to make it harder for patients and students to discharge debt in bankruptcy filings. At the same time Hunter was operating as a Beltway lobbyist, he was receiving “consulting payments” from his old employer MBNA, which was still courting his father over the bankruptcy reforms.

In 2007, Hunter also dined with a private prison lobbyist who had business before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Joe Biden chaired, according to published reports. Senate rules bar members or their staff from having contact with family members who are lobbyists seeking to influence legislation.

Hunter’s lawyer-lobbyist firm was embroiled in a conflict-of-interest controversy in 2006 when it was criticized for representing a lobbyist under investigation by the House ethics committee. The lobbyist was still taking payments from his old K Street firm while working as a top aide on the House Appropriations Committee. Hunter at the time was lobbying that same committee for earmarks for his clients.

William Oldaker did not just make Hunter a rich lobbyist. Oldaker also secured a $1 million loan for him through a bank he co-founded, WashingtonFirst, that Hunter sought for an investment scheme, which later went sour.

Joe Biden deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign and political action committee donations at WashingtonFirst, while funneling hundreds of thousands in campaign and PAC expenditures to Oldaker, Biden & Belair. Joe Biden’s payments to Hunter’s lobbying firm, including more than $143,000 in 2007 alone, were listed as “legal services” in Federal Election Commission filings.

Oldaker did not respond to a request for comment left at his office.

2003-2005: National Group LLP

While serving as a partner at Oldaker, Biden & Belair, Hunter also registered as a lobbyist for National Group, a lobbying-only subsidiary which shared offices with OB&B and specialized in targeted spending items inserted into legislation known as “earmarks.”

Hunter represented his father’s alma mater, the University of Delaware, and other Biden constituents and submitted requests to Biden’s office for earmarks benefiting these clients in appropriations bills.

2006-2007: Paradigm Companies LLC

In 2005, when Joe Biden was thinking about making another run at the White House, after a 1987 bid that ended in plagiarism charges, his lobbyist son was looking for a new line of work too.

In early 2006, Wall Street executive and Biden family friend Anthony Lotito said, Biden’s younger brother, Jim, phoned him on behalf of the senator. He said Biden wanted his youngest son – whom he still called “Honey” – to get out of the lobbying business to avoid allegations of conflicts of interest that might dog Biden’s presidential bid.

“Biden was concerned with the impact that Hunter’s lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign [and asked his brother to] seek Lotito’s assistance in finding employment for Hunter in a non-lobbying capacity,” according to a January 2007 complaint that Lotito filed in New York state court against Hunter over alleged breach of contract in a related venture. (Jim and Hunter Biden denied such a phone call took place as described.)

Lotito told the court he agreed to help Hunter as a favor to the senator, who had served on the powerful banking committee. He figured “the financial community might be a good starting place in which to seek out employment on Hunter’s behalf,” the court documents state. But he quickly found that Wall Street had “no interest” in hiring Biden.

So the Bidens hatched a scheme to buy a hedge fund, “whereby Hunter would then assume a senior executive position with the company.” And Lotito helped broker the deal. Despite having no Wall Street experience, Biden was appointed interim CEO and president of the Paradigm investment fund and given a $1.2 million salary, according to SEC filings. Lotito joined the enterprise as a partner, and agreed to shepherd Hunter, still in his mid-30s, through his new role in high-finance.

“Given Hunter Biden’s inexperience in the securities industry,” the complaint states, it was agreed that Lotito would maintain an office at the new holding company’s New York headquarters “in order to assist Biden in discharging his duties as president.”

After the venture failed, Lotito sued the Bidens for fraud. The Bidens countersued and the two parties settled in 2008.

2006-2009: Amtrak

During this same period, Hunter was appointed vice chairman of the taxpayer-subsidized rail line, thanks to the sponsorship of powerful Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, a political ally of his father.

In a 2006 statement submitted to the Senate during his confirmation, Hunter asserted that he was qualified for the Amtrak board because “as a frequent commuter and Amtrak customer for over 30 years, I have literally logged thousands of miles on Amtrak.”

Amtrak officials and employees have been big supporters of Joe Biden — for example donating a total of $44,490 to Biden this year (vs. $12,413 to Trump), according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Amtrak even named a train station after him in Wilmington. In return, Biden has supported taxpayer subsidies for the government railroad throughout his political career.

In his testimony, Hunter denied his Amtrak appointment pushed conflict-of-interest boundaries.

2009- : Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC

Hunter co-founded the investment firm five months after his father moved into the White House and incorporated it in his father’s home state of Delaware, which has strict corporate secrecy rules.

At the time, President Barack Obama had tapped Vice President Biden to oversee the recovery from the financial crisis. Three weeks after Rosemont was incorporated, Hunter and his partners set up a subsidiary called Rosemont TALF and got $24 million in loans from the federal program known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. TALF was designed to help bail out banks and auto lenders hit by the crisis.

Within months, Rosemont had secured a total of $130 million from the program. Some of the government cash was then funneled into an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, SEC records show. Such offshore accounts are commonly used to evade taxes.

The move raised ethical flags with government watchdogs who suspected the bailout cash was used to benefit a well-connected insider.

Other records reveal that another subsidiary created years later – Rosemont Realty – touted to its investors that board adviser Hunter was politically connected. It highlighted in a company prospectus that he was the “son of Vice President Biden.”

2009-2012: Eudora Global

On his resume, Hunter also lists himself as “founder” of yet another investment firm. But Eudora’s articles of incorporation show it was actually set up by a major Biden donor, Jeffrey Cooper, who put Hunter on his board after his father became vice president.

A self-described “friend of the Biden family,” Cooper also happened to run one of the largest asbestos-litigation firms in the country — SimmonsCooper LLC — and had courted Biden to make it easier to file asbestos lawsuits by defeating tort reforms. As a leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden had blocked reform of asbestos litigation every time bills reached the Senate floor.

Cooper’s law firm, which directly lobbied the Delaware senator’s office to kill such bills, donated more than $200,000 to Biden’s campaigns over the years, as well as his Unite Our States PAC, FEC records show. In fact, SimmonsCooper was one of Biden’s biggest donors during his failed 2007-2008 run for president, pumping $53,000 into his campaign.

The firm also put up $1 million in investment capital to help his son buy out the Paradigm hedge fund as part of the arrangement brokered by another Biden family friend, Lotito, to find non-lobbying work for Hunter. Thanks in large part to Biden’s effort to kill bills reining in asbestos trial lawyers, SimmonsCooper has hauled in more than $1 billion for alleged asbestos victims.

Attempts to reach Cooper for comment were unsuccessful.

2009-2016: Boies Schiller Flexner LLP

When Joe Biden became vice president, Hunter landed a high-paying, no-show job at the New York-based law firm, a Democrat shop long tied to the Clintons. Another major Biden donor, the firm gave him the title “of counsel.”

Boies Schiller brought Hunter aboard in 2009 after the Bidens hired the firm to defend Hunter against charges he defrauded partners in the Paradigm investment venture. Boies Schiller managed to get the case dismissed.

In 2014, a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch, who was under investigation and looking to repair his reputation to attract Western investors, started sending large payments to Boies to support Hunter for unspecified work. It’s unclear what Hunter did for the oligarch, who ran the gas giant Burisma, but $283,000 showed up at the same time his father was tapped by Obama to play a central role in overseeing U.S. energy policy in Ukraine.

Boies Schiller has pumped more than $50,000 into Biden’s campaigns, Federal Election Commission records show.

2013-2019: BHR Partners

After Obama named Biden his point man on China policy, Rosemont Seneca set up a joint venture worth $1 billion with the Bank of China called BHR – and Hunter was named vice chairman and director of the new concern.

Following in the shadow of his father’s political trajectory, Hunter’s new venture won the first-of-its-kind investment deal with the Chinese government at the same time Biden was jetting to Beijing to meet with top communist leaders. Secret Service records reveal Hunter flew to China on Air Force Two with his father while brokering the December 2013 deal. He arranged for one of his Chinese partners to shake hands with the vice president. BHR was registered 12 days later. Beijing OK’d a business license shortly afterward.

“No one else had such an arrangement in China,” said Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute.

Hunter resigned from the board of the Beijing-backed equity firm earlier this year as his father faced growing criticism on the campaign trail over what critics called a glaring conflict of interest. He did not, however, divest his 10 percent equity stake in the Chinese fund, which is estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars.

Schweizer, whose books include “Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elites,” said Biden went “soft” on the Chinese communists so his son could “cash in” on China business deals. Biden insists he did not discuss the venture with his son before, during, or after his official visit to Beijing. But others see obvious hypocrisy at play in the Biden family’s self-dealing in notoriously corrupt China.

“Biden was one of the most vocal champions of anti-corruption efforts in the Obama administration. So when this same Biden takes his son with him to China aboard Air Force Two, and within days Hunter joins the board of an investment advisory firm with stakes in China, it does not matter what father and son discussed,” said Sarah Chayes, author of “Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens National Security.” “Joe Biden has enabled this brand of practice.”

2013-2014: U.S. Navy Reserve

Hunter was selected for a direct commission as a public affairs officer in a Virginia reserve unit.

He clearly received special treatment in securing the part-time post. Officers had to issue him two waivers – one for his age and one for a previous drug offense. His vice president father swore him in at the White House in a small, private ceremony.

Barely a year later, authorities booted Hunter from the Navy for cocaine use after he tested positive from a urine test. The reason for his discharge was withheld from the press for several months.

2014-2019: Burisma Holdings

The Ukrainian gas giant added Hunter to its board soon after Obama named his father his point man on Ukraine policy, focusing on energy. The company paid his son as much as $83,000 a month, even though he had no energy experience to bring to the table and was required to attend just one board meeting a year.

At the time, the vice president was steering U.S. aid to Kyiv to help develop its gas fields, which stood to benefit Burisma as the holder of permits to develop natural gas in three of Ukraine’s most lucrative fields. Biden promised Ukrainian officials the United States would pump more than $1 billion into their energy industry and economy during a visit to Kyiv in late April 2014. He urged leaders to increase the country’s gas supply and to rely on Americans to help them. Less than three weeks later, Burisma appointed his son to the board, after already retaining him for undisclosed services through Boies Schiller.

Burisma was run by an oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky, who was under investigation at the time and seeking Western protection from prosecution. In a move observers suspect was intended to send a message to prosecutors, the company sent out a news release in May 2014 claiming, falsely, that Hunter would be in charge of its “legal unit.” Burisma also trumpeted the fact that Hunter was “the son of the current U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden.”

Biden’s office was aware Burisma was under investigation. The administration had tried to partner with the gas company through U.S. aid programs, but the outreach project was blocked over corruption concerns lodged by career diplomats.

In early 2016, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. “If the prosecutor is not fired,” Biden recalled telling Ukraine’s leader, “you’re not getting the money.”

Biden’s muscling worked: Shokin was sacked in March 2016.

The former vice president says he was carrying out official U.S. policy that sought to remove an ineffective prosecutor. But Shokin had raided the home of Burisma’s owner and seized his property.

In addition, Shokin said that as part of his probe he was making plans to interview Hunter about millions of dollars in fees he and his partners had received from Burisma. He insists he was fired because he refused to close the investigation.

“The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma, and Joe Biden’s son was a member of the board,” Shokin said in a recent sworn affidavit prepared for a European court. “I assume Burisma had the support of Joe Biden because his son was on the board.” He added that the vice president himself had “significant interests” in Burisma.

The prosecutor who replaced Shokin shut down the Burisma probe within 10 months. Burisma’s founder was also taken off a U.S. government visa ban list.

Biden claims he only learned of his son joining the Burisma board from the news media. But there is evidence Biden had been consulted in advance. White House visitor logs show that Biden met with Hunter’s business partner Devon Archer on April 16, 2014. Burisma put Archer on its board shortly thereafter, followed by Hunter the next month. (Both Archer and Hunter maintain Burisma never came up during the private visit in Biden’s office, which lasted late into the night.)

The day after Joe Biden’s meeting with Hunter’s partner in the White House, Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi reportedly emailed Hunter to thank him for inviting him to Washington and “giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent[sic] some time together.” The Biden campaign asserts it cannot find a meeting with Pozharskyi on the former vice president’s “schedule,” though it did not deny such a meeting could have taken place. The Ukrainian official mentioned going out for coffee with Hunter on April 17, 2014, which indicated he was physically in D.C. at the time. RCI has not confirmed the authenticity of the April 17 email document, first disclosed by the New York Post after obtaining it from a hard drive allegedly copied from a laptop of Hunter Biden left at a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware. Pozharskyi did not respond to emails seeking comment.

Hunter stepped down from Burisma’s board in April 2019, a month before his father announced his White House bid and after critics made an issue of the conflicts his sinecure posed. He has since kept a very low profile. Unlike Trump’s children, Biden’s son is not out on the trail campaigning for him.

1,850 Boxes Sealed Until After Election

“Hunter Biden had no experience in the field, but he did have a notable connection to the vice president, who publicly has bragged about making clear to the Ukrainians that he alone controlled U.S. aid to the country,” noted Jonathan Turley, a public-interest law professor at George Washington University.

Retired FBI official I.C. Smith, who led public corruption investigations in Washington and Little Rock, Arkansas, said both father and son should have known joining Burisma was a bad idea, adding that it gives at least the appearance he was leveraging his name for payoffs from shady clients abroad.

“Clearly he’s led a troubled life and would be the sort of person susceptible to becoming engaged in this sort of rather sordid deal,” Smith said of Hunter.

“When he said his father asked if the deal was on the up and up and was assured it was, I would think, given Hunter’s past, the father would have asked more questions,” he added.

Hunter acknowledged in an ABC News interview last year that he lacked experience in both energy and Ukraine, but maintained that Burisma was impressed by other things on his resume.

“Ironically, Hunter highlighted his work at MBNA and his work on the board of Amtrak as evidence of his qualifications for the Burisma gig,” said Fitton of Judicial Watch. “But both the MBNA and Amtrak jobs, under any sensible analysis, were obvious favors for Joe Biden.”

Fitton argued that Biden’s claim he never discussed his son’s jobs and business deals rings hollow against the lengthy record of something-for-nothing nepotism.

“That’s campaign spin,” he said. “Hunter has already admitted to having at least one conversation on the Ukraine issue with Vice President Biden.”

Biden defenders argue that many relatives of politicians are often involved in government and politics. Ivanka Trump and Don Trump Jr., for instance, have cozy relationships with, or financial stakes in, companies that may benefit from those decisions. They also point out that, while they may look bad, there’s nothing illegal about such arrangements.

Fitton isn’t so sure. He said Judicial Watch is demanding Obama administration documents related to Hunter’s Ukraine and China deals, as well as other business arrangements potentially monetizing Biden’s political power.

“We can’t be sure if the arrangements were legal,” he said. “If any payments or jobs were neither ordinary nor customary, there may be legal issues.”

It’s a federal crime to provide a government benefit or favorable change in policy in exchange for something of personal value. At a minimum, argued former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, Biden “had a conflict of interest with the position his son had” on the Burisma board, noting that at the time, Biden was pushing energy policies that favored the gas giant.

Not all of Hunter Biden’s critics are coming from the right, either.

“It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a liberal watchdog group based in Washington.

While Joe Biden insists “there’s been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else,” Senate investigators are seeking a number of related emails and memos generated during the Obama administration, as well as his 36-year Senate career. That period, spanning from 1973 to 2009, coincides with a large chunk of his son’s resume.

However, Biden has sealed the bulk of the records at the University of Delaware Library, which refuses to release any of his papers until after the election. It maintains more than 1,850 boxes of Biden records, including his speeches, voting records, position papers, and notes from confidential interviews he’s conducted with foreign leaders, among other documents. The papers the university is keeping a lid on could shed light on Biden’s thinking behind foreign policies and controversial bills he sponsored.

A spokeswoman said the library will not release any of Biden’s papers to the public until they are “properly processed and archived.” Until then, “access is only available with Vice President Biden’s express consent,” she said, while declining to answer whether the university would comply if the Senate subpoenaed documents as part of its investigation of the Bidens.

The university houses the Biden Institute, which is part of the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy and Administration.

Through a lawyer, Hunter maintained he and his father dutifully avoided “conflicts of interest” — or even “the appearance of such conflicts.” In every business pursuit, he asserted, they acted “appropriately and in good faith.”

However, in a moment of candor during a recent ABC News interview, Hunter confessed: “I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn’t Biden,” before adding, “There’s literally nothing my father in some way hasn’t had influence over.”

Still, the elder Biden argues it’s the Trump family who has the nepotism problem. In a recent CBS “60 Minutes” interview, he slammed the president for letting his daughter and son-in-law “sit in on Cabinet meetings.”

“It’s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you’re doing is for them,” he intoned. “For them.”

Why Big Media Will Never Report On Hunter Biden’s Emails,"The corporate media has refused to cover the substance of the New York Post’s bombshell reporting on Hunter Biden’s recovered laptop and emails, not because there’s nothing to the story or because the emails are fake, but because the story itself is, on its face, harmful to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

That’s not to say news outlets haven’t been writing about the Post’s reporting. They’ve simply decided to cover the meta-narrative—the story about the story—while studiously ignoring what Hunter Biden’s emails reveal about his family’s overseas business dealings and influence-peddling.

Here’s how it works. Instead of aggressive follow-up reporting on the content of Hunter Biden’s emails, which is what you’d expect from news organizations, we’ve gotten a wave of process stories about the “anatomy” of the Post’s “dubious” reporting, censorship stories about Twitter and Facebook, and wild conspiracy theory stories about a rumored Russian disinformation plot.

Last week when all this broke, the focus quickly shifted from Hunter Biden’s emails to a decision by Facebook and Twitter to censor the Post’s reporting, and, in Twitter’s case, lock the Post’s official account for posting “hacked” materials (there’s no evidence the emails were hacked). When Twitter tried to walk back but also justify its draconian policies, the media reported on that, and when a handful of Republican senators announced they’d be subpoenaing Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over the imbroglio, the media reported on that, too.

What they didn’t report on is the obvious thing the emails reveal: Hunter Biden was trading on his family name overseas, and Joe Biden, despite his many denials, seems to have been aware of this and might have even been a part of it.

Understand what’s going on here: The media will report on almost any aspect of this story, no matter how tangential or relatively insignificant, rather than grapple with the story itself.

Almost nothing is too trivial on this front. Over the weekend, we got stories in The New York Times and New York Magazine about behind-the-scenes dissent from a handful of anonymous Post employees who thought the Biden story shouldn’t have run. The Times article goes into great detail about whose bylines were attached to the Post’s reporting, how long each reporter had been at the paper, where he or she had worked previously, and the process top Post editors went through before publication.

Same for the New York Magazine article, which also tacitly dismissed the substance of the Post’s reporting—“supposed” scoop, “purported” emails—while quoting anonymous Post reporters grousing about how they’ve been “bracing” for the Post to “go pro-Trump before the election.”

What meager follow-up reporting on the substance of the emails we have seen has almost all been for the purpose of undermining the Post. The Washington Post, for one, was quick to “fact-check” the Post by casting vague aspersions on its reporting while failing to offer any new information or insights into the trove of emails detailing Hunter Biden’s foreign business deals.

Even more embarrassing have been outlets like CNN and USA Today, which, citing unnamed sources, breathlessly speculated that the FBI was investigating whether the emails were a possible “disinformation campaign” originating from—where else?—Moscow. (Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Monday laid these feverish rumors to rest, saying the recovered laptop and emails are “not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.”)

The Media Can’t Handle The Truth

The media’s preoccupation with the provenance of the laptop and the emails—are they “hacked materials” or are they part of a shadowy plot hatched by the Kremlin?—is meant to distract the broader public about what the laptop and emails actually contain.

After all, the last thing a media establishment in thrall to the Democratic Party wants to do is ask substantive questions about any of this. Why did a Ukrainian oligarch thank Hunter Biden for an introduction to his father in 2015 when the elder Biden was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine? What did Hunter Biden mean when he told a Chinese energy firm that a lucrative deal would be “interesting for me and my family”?

The press isn’t interested, just like they weren’t interested in a recent U.S. Senate committee report on the Bidens’ complex financial transactions in Ukraine and elsewhere. I mean, if you’re not curious why the wife of the former mayor of Moscow would pay Hunter Biden $3.5 million, then you’re not going to be curious about any of this other stuff.

To be clear, it doesn’t matter what the Post or any other news outlet actually reports, or how airtight their reporting is. It doesn’t matter that no one, not even the Biden campaign, has denied the authenticity of the emails in question. It doesn’t matter that Fox News has independently corroborated one of the emails that indirectly references Joe Biden as one of six recipients of “renumeration packages” from the aforementioned Chinese energy firm. It doesn’t matter that the laptop came from a Delaware computer store and not, you know, Russia.

The mainstream media will not, under any circumstances, treat this as a serious story. The same media establishment that was willing to perpetuate a years-long Russia collusion hoax, for which it relied on an outlandish dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, will not countenance the Hunter Biden laptop story—no matter what.

They won’t do it for the simple reason that it will almost certainly hurt Biden’s White House bid, and they can’t have that.

There’s No Evidence For NYT’s ‘Disinformation’ Cover Of Biden Emails,"The campaign to delegitimize newly surfaced emails that implicate the Biden family in a massive foreign corruption scheme was a year in the making, and the seed for Team Biden’s “Russian disinformation” rebuttal was first planted in The New York Times.

Last week, the New York Post released a series of bombshell articles highlighting Hunter Biden’s corrupt business dealings with America’s greatest adversaries. Hunter Biden’s emails, which were acquired by The Post, appeared to reveal that he was leveraging his father’s political prestige to acquire riches for his family from adversarial regimes in China, shadowy companies in Eastern Europe, and elsewhere around the world.

The emails also reference the possibility that Joe Biden, who appears to be referred to as “the big guy” and other monikers, was personally aware of Hunter’s activities, and even took a cut of the money.

Almost immediately after the emails surfaced, countless legacy media outlets and Democrat surrogates suggested they were not authentic. Twitter and Facebook blocked the stories from getting out. They claimed this was not the work of terrific research and reporting, but a “Russian disinformation” campaign.

The New York Times published an article claiming that “United States intelligence analysts” had “picked up chatter that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked in the form of an ‘October surprise,’” claiming the Biden emails may have been the result of a previous hack of Burisma, a Ukraine-based gas company that gave Hunter Biden a seat on their board until he resigned in April 2019.

This was enough for the rest of the legacy media to run wild with the story. Countless publications cited The New York Times article in bolstering the claim that the Biden emails were part of a sophisticated Russian disinformation operation.

There is one major problem with this Russian hacking origin story. There’s no proof any of it ever happened.

On January 13, 2020, less than a month after the FBI took possession of Hunter Biden’s emails, The New York Times reported that Burisma was hacked by the Russians. The story was reported as fact, but there is no reported evidence for the story. Instead, it cites “security experts” — only a single, Democrat-tied security firm — in making the authoritative claim.

The article gets straight to the point. The first paragraph reads: “With President Trump facing an impeachment trial over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, Russian military hackers have been boring into the Ukrainian gas company at the center of the affair, according to security experts.”

“The attacks were very successful,” Oren Falkowitz, who was the source for the hacking claim, told The New York Times. Falkowitz, who openly disdains President Trump (check out his Twitter page), runs a company called Area 1 Security. He has provided business services to several Democrat contenders for president during the primaries.

Public records show Falkowitz donated to Democrat Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker during the primaries. A National Security Agency employee under the Bush and Obama administrations, Falkowitz founded Area 1 with a man who used to be a top executive at Crowdstrike, which authored the infamous report claiming the Democratic National Committee was hacked by the Russians in 2016.

The Times also quotes an unnamed “American security official,” who the “Paper of Record” says told them “the Russian attacks on Burisma appear to be running parallel to an effort by Russian spies in Ukraine to dig up information in the analog world that could embarrass the Bidens.”

As “evidence” that the GRU (a Russian military intelligence agency) hacked Burisma, The Times did not supply anything. Even The Washington Post did not report on the story as if it was verified. The Washington Post reached out to Fireye, another cybersecurity firm, which “could not validate” the claim that Burisma was breached by the GRU.

Area 1’s five-page report on the purported hack of Burisma does not deliver any verifiable information to conclude that the Russians hacked the organization. The report summarized that the supposed phishing attack involved “tactics, techniques and procedures” used by the GRU, and that was enough to identify this apparent intrusion as evidence that Russia was behind it.

Besides the fact that there is zero evidence for the hack, there are many reasons the story is incredibly sketchy. First, as noted above, The New York Times article was published just one month after the FBI reportedly seized the materials on Hunter Biden’s laptop, which occurred in December 2019.

Also, the timeline doesn’t add up. Hunter Biden resigned from the board of Burisma in April 2019, months before his former company was allegedly hacked.

Additionally, Burisma is not exactly an anti-Kremlin outfit. In fact, the shadowy energy company has several ties to Moscow. Burisma was founded by Mykola Zlochevsky, who was a top Ukrainian official under ex-president Viktor Yanukovych, who is widely considered a stooge for the Kremlin. Yanukovych has since fled to Moscow.

Burisma was a creation of Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych regime. Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia in February 2014. Burisma, under its Yanukovych-era leadership, appointed Hunter Biden to the board in April 2014. @JackPosobiec https://t.co/UgnR0xH8LX — J Michael Waller (@JMichaelWaller) October 18, 2020

The “Russian disinformation” angle concerning the Hunter Biden emails was sketched by The New York Times. It has absolutely zero supporting evidence and no basis in reality.

Big Tech Slept With China And Brought Venereal Censorship To America,"Big Tech slept with communist China and brought venereal censorship back home to America. This is why it’s always dangerous to treat one-party authoritarian dictatorships as if they’re as harmless as Canada. If you don’t appreciate the intrinsic threat of governments that ban freedom, then they will spread their despotism faster than you can cure their disease.

Since Bill Clinton invited China into the World Trade Organization while pretending that the Tiananmen Square massacre never happened, and replaced American manufacturing jobs with China’s slave labor force, the stated foreign policy “dream” was for American society’s freedom and openness to rub off on our old communist foe. Instead, the United States has empowered China’s military might by enriching China with America’s investment wealth, and all Americans received in return was a crappy “Made in China” T-shirt.

Greedy Washington insiders let Wall Street sellout Main Streets across the country with the fairytale promise that we could buy a future-proof peace with China for the next century. China took Wall Street’s money, smiled while Washington whittled away America’s manufacturing expertise, and bought up America’s debt with U.S. citizens’ own money.

American globalists committed to undermining our blue-collar labor force for beads and trinkets have ensured the rise of a Chinese superpower that now threatens the equilibrium of peace and security that this great intercontinental transfer of wealth to Asia was supposed to prevent. China’s President Xi Jinping recently told his military to “prepare for war.” Once again, Clinton Democrats and neoconservative Republicans pursued the exact policies necessary to usher in a dangerous decade with the potential for worldwide conflict on the horizon.

So, what have Americans reaped in return for this debacle? Once proud and self-sufficient towns across America have been wrecked by an industrial exodus that has left a generation of local workers lost, despondent, and alone. Instead of America’s supposed cultural dominance celebrated and coinciding with an expansion of freedom and democracy abroad, the same discarded blue-collar workers get to see American openness recede behind heavy-handed lockdown mandates of Democrat officials, Big Media propaganda, and the torching of free speech at the hands of Silicon Valley’s pirate overlords.

One of the biggest stories of the 2020 campaign is how Facebook and Twitter censored the New York Post’s bombshell story documenting Hunter Biden’s efforts to merchandize his father’s political office for financial gain in Ukraine and China. It paints the picture of a pay-to-play arrangement strenuously denied by Joe Biden for over a year, apparently covered up by an FBI unwilling to pursue investigatory leads dumped in its lap, and transformed into a Trump impeachment by the Schiff-Nadler-Pelosi smear party and their agents in the press.

Let’s not pretend, however, that the Biden family’s solicitation of Ukraine and Chinese payoffs and the coordinated attacks on free speech by Big Media and Big Tech sprang up unexpectedly in the middle of the night. Washington opened up America’s economy 20 years ago to a corrupt communist regime, and we have been paying the price ever since.

Our politicians didn’t sell the idea of freedom to China; China simply made corrupt American politicians more corrupt. In the process, American culture has been refashioned to treat China as a friend, while largely ignoring its suppression of free speech, persecution of Christians, and outright murder of political dissidents.

LeBron James is too young to remember Tiananmen Square, too intentionally ignorant of China’s Holocaust-like sterilizations and genocide against its Uighur citizens, and too well paid by Chinese interests to recognize China’s human rights atrocities as some of the most heinous acts since the Second World War. LeBron can praise communist China while kneeling in protest of the American flag and the freedom it represents because he knows no better. And he knows no better partly because Washington, Wall Street, and our academic elite have pretended for 20 years that Chinese communism is somehow a gentler, more peaceful, free-market kind of communism that Americans can and should get behind.

It is an awful irony that so many freedom fighters in Hong Kong and Taiwan live each day in the shadow of China’s brute authoritarianism, and American leftists attacking President Trump’s policies geared toward fighting back against the ever-growing threat of a rising China.

The worst irony of all, however, is that after welcoming China into the global free trade club with all the international privileges once reserved for freedom-loving nations, Americans are increasingly having information actively censored and suppressed by unelected and unaccountable technology companies that have brought an ample dose of China’s authoritarianism back home to the United States.

We’re now at a point where American tech firms with near-monopoly power and tremendous revenue streams from China can actively censor a breaking news story detailing a presidential candidate’s connection to influence-peddling — in China. There may be a “Manchurian candidate” this election cycle, but those same tech firms have decided that the story should never be told. Who needs to worry about a “Manchurian candidate” when it is clear we have entire “Manchurian industries” playing us for fools?

Big Tech has been flirting with political censorship for quite some time, but its organized efforts to actively influence an American presidential election by embargoing newsworthy information from being seen by American voters represent a complete embrace of near CCP-levels of censorship. Just as these American tech companies have aided China in “scoring” the “social worthiness” of citizens, they’ve turned their systems of thought crime punishment upon Americans.

Whatever glossy hopes of spreading American freedom to China existed 20 years ago have backfired spectacularly. American manufacturing lies in tatters, American wealth has been repurposed toward Chinese imperialism, and American tech companies have become ambassadors for Chinese censorship. For Americans who have lost everything from Washington’s ill-advised dance with a communist superpower that wishes us harm, the “Made in China” label looks more like a takeover than a bargain.

Hypocrisy On Biden Corruption Versus Spygate Proves Big Media Is Evil,"Big media’s divergent handling of the Steele dossier and the Hunter Biden email stories proves that the corrupt press is not just the enemy of the people, but the enemy of truth, freedom, and our constitutional republic.

For nearly four years, big media peddled Russia collusion as reality-based and the Christopher Steele “dossier” it rested upon as “mostly verified” or “fake but accurate.” Relying on unnamed sources, inuendo, and illegal leaks, the press played a constant refrain of Russia, Russia, Russia, while promising a smoking gun would soon emerge from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation.

At the same time, when the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee at the time, Devin Nunes, released a memorandum detailing the abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court as part of the Russia collusion “investigation,” the media portrayed the memo as resting on “shaky grounds” and designed solely to undermine the special counsel investigation, which itself was launched as a result of a leak from former FBI Director James Comey.

Conversely, when Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., lied to the American public about Russia collusion, the media portrayed his assertions as infallible. Even Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on FISA abuse did not compel corporate media to change course.

To this day, the majority of Americans likely have no idea that “Spygate” actually occurred. Heck, just two months ago, CNN’s Jim Acosta displayed his ignorance of the facts, responding to Trump’s complaints that the Obama administration had spied on his campaign. “That is just not true. That did not happen, it has not been proven,” Acosta intoned on TV.

Yes, Jim, it has been proven true.

While U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into the entire Russian collusion hoax remains ongoing, much more Democrat malfeasance has already been proven true as well. The average American might not know it, though, given the corrupt mainstream press’s penchant for putting a lid on news that proves Trump was right.

When news broke that Steele’s primary sub-source had been investigated for being a Russian agent, there was scant mention of the development, even though it suggested the Steele dossier Democrats used might have been Russian disinformation. CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Obama on Russian intelligence claiming that on July 28, 2016, Hillary Clinton approved vilifying Trump by claiming Russian interference in the election. That major story was likewise a news blip in the election-year cycle.

In short, corporate media ignored, downplayed, or spun the biggest, most widespread political scandal in our country’s history, involving the Obama-Biden administration’s spying on a political enemy, with Russian-provided fake intelligence bought and paid for by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

Now, big media is ignoring, downplaying, or spinning evidence suggesting the second biggest political-corruption scandal in our country’s history. They are ignoring evidence that former Vice President Biden knowingly helped his son Hunter, and Hunter’s “business” partners, sell access and influence to foreign officials and businesses, and possibly received a kick-back of the payouts.

The evidence of the Bidens’ corruption comes not from unverified and unnamed sources, but from emails and texts recovered from a laptop left at a Delaware computer store, and emails provided by Hunter’s former business partner. The corporate press, however, pretends those emails and texts can’t be relied upon because they haven’t personally verified them. But others have. In addition, salacious videos and photographs of Hunter Biden have been recovered from the laptop, providing excellent evidence of its authenticity.

Hunter and Joe Biden also have not disputed the emails’ validity—something very easy to do. Secret Service records have also corroborated many of the travel details included in the emails.

While the evidence overwhelmingly confirms the authenticity of the emails and text messages, the fake news instead runs with intelligence official-rejected claims that the corruption scandal is Russian disinformation, pushed by none other than Russia-collusion clown Schiff! Not only is there no evidence the emails and text messages are “Russian disinformation,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe—who, unlike Schiff, has access to the actual intelligence—has stated unequivocally that “the laptop is not part of a Russian disinformation campaign targeting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.” FBI and Justice Department officials have also reportedly agreed with Ratcliffe’s assessment.

If the emails are authentic, as all the evidence to date indicates, then they cannot possibly be Russian disinformation. They must be truth. And that truth indicates corruption that pierces to the heart of our democratic republic: elected officials selling access to government decisionmakers to benefit their families and themselves.

While Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed to the public that he has never “discussed his son Hunter’s overseas business activity with Hunter ‘or with anyone else,’” emails indicate Hunter introduced his then-vice president father to a senior adviser to the Ukrainian company Burisma. At that very time, Burisma, which was under investigation in Ukraine for corruption, “was showering Hunter with upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation.”

The elder Biden also later bragged about causing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating corruption at Burisma by threatening to withhold a billion dollars in loans unless he was axed. “Well, son of a b-tch. (Laughter.) He got fired,” Biden postscripted the incident at a public event.

The hard drive evidence goes even further, suggesting Hunter may have even served as the bag man for the political family: “A text recovered from the hard drive also suggests the former vice president may have received a cut of Hunter’s ‘earnings.’ ‘I Hope you all cal do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family Fro 30 years,’” a screenshot of a text from January 2019 to Hunter’s daughter read. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry unlike Pop I won’t make you give me half your salary.”

Other emails indicate Ukraine was not the only target of the family shakedown. “Subsequent reporting from the Post confirmed by Fox News later revealed that Chinese businessmen with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party were offering Hunter Biden $10 million a year for ‘introductions alone.’” Again, a Hunter email indicates Joe Biden was to receive a share of the proceeds—here a 10 percent cut of the compensation package.

The evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Biden was complicit in his son’s pay-to-play scheme is solid, and the email and texts indicating the long-time politician received a cut of the proceeds even more damning. But corporate media doesn’t care. Biden is a means for them to dump Trump.

Ignoring this story goes beyond protecting corrupt politicians. Should Joe Biden win the election, U.S. national security is gravely at risk because he is clearly compromised. “Every country, every foreign politician or political faction, and every corrupt oligarch or business that paid for access has the emails, notes, receipts, itineraries, fund transfers, and maybe even photographs or recordings,” which is a fatal lever over our potential commander-in-chief.

If he becomes president, Joe Biden’s apparent corruption puts America and Americans at serious risk. If that happens, the fault will not merely lay at his feet, but at the door of every “journalist” who ignored the evidence to avoid a repeat of 2016’s election results.

Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Joe Biden’s Latest Scandals,"Former Vice President Joe Biden will take the debate stage for the final time tonight as new questions about his son’s overseas business ventures upend the Democratic nominee’s campaign less than two weeks before election day.

Last week, the New York Post began running a series of exposés expanding the public scope of Biden family corruption based on material from a laptop retrieved from a Delaware repair shop. The computer, suspected of belonging to Hunter Biden, was first found by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who then turned its contents over to the authorities and the Post.

Days later, the diligent reporters at the Post began publishing its contents. They broke the internet with earthshattering revelations and not only blew back the curtain on the Biden family’s corruption but also exposed Big Tech and mass media pushing everything in their power to prevent the “October surprise” from undermining their preferred presidential candidate’s campaign.

Here’s everything you need to know about the bombshells altering the dynamics of an already contentious race two weeks out.

Ukraine

Questions about the former vice president’s son’s overseas business activity had been present for years but attracted wider attention over last fall’s sham impeachment when Democrats went nuclear to protect their presidential frontrunner from close scrutiny. The Democratic witch trial ultimately backfired with Republicans emerging triumphantly from the partisan proceedings, during which important information emerged that pivoted the focus back on Biden.

In 2014, Hunter Biden was added to the board of Burisma, a notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy firm that shelled out upwards of $50,000 a month to the vice president’s son despite his lack of any prior experience in the industry. At that time, Joe Biden was serving as the “public face” of White House policy towards Ukraine. Less than a year later, Joe Biden pressured for the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who had plans to investigate Hunter Biden and the firm showering the younger Biden in excess compensation.

Joe Biden went on to brag about the role he played in Shokin’s ousting during a 2018 event with the publication Foreign Affairs. Biden said he threatened to withhold $1 billion in loans to the Ukrainian government if they did not fire the prosecutor looking into Burisma.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in’ — I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,'” Biden recalled telling the Ukrainian president at the time. “Well son of a b-tch, he got fired.”

In September, Senate investigators released a long-anticipated report wrapping up a more than three-year investigation into the Biden family’s conflicts of interest while in the upper echelons of government. The Senate’s findings include an alleged $7 million bribe that Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky paid to Ukrainian officials to shut down an investigation of the firm following Hunter Biden’s hiring. The payment set off red flags in the State Department and the Justice Department, which referred it to the FBI.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department’s top official in Ukraine, had previously told lawmakers he learned of Hunter Biden’s lucrative board position around the same time and raised his discomfort over the conflict of interest with the vice president’s office. Kent reported he was dismissed by White House staff.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition last year. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

Since jumping into the presidential race last year, former Vice President Biden has vehemently denied ever discussing his son’s overseas business ventures with his son, “or with anyone else,” and even fat-shamed an Iowa voter pressing him on the issue during a December town hall.

Less than three weeks before the general election 10 months later, the New York Post dropped its first bombshell report on Oct. 14 revealing emails that contradict Joe Biden’s repeated denials of discussing his son’s business. The emails show that Hunter Biden introduced his vice president father to a Burisma senior adviser named Vadym Pozharski and the three had an in-person meeting.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Pozharskyi wrote in an email to Hunter.

Yet throughout the entire election, the former vice president maintained, “I don’t discuss business with my son.”

Hunter Biden’s business in Ukraine, however, only tells half the developing story of the Biden family’s apparent pay-to-play dealings.

China

Hunter Biden’s 2013 trip to China aboard Air Force Two with his vice president father has also long been an area of suspicion about Biden’s overseas business dealings.

It was in Beijing that Hunter Biden participated in a series of meetings with Chinese businessmen building a global private equity firm. What happened shortly after the trip raised more questions about the purpose of Hunter Biden’s presence on the government-sponsored trip, during which Shanghai authorities approved a Chinese business license for the firm known as BHR.

Hunter Biden served as one of BHR’s nine directors. A Wall Street Journal analysis shows the firm channeled at least $2.5 billion into automotive, energy, mining, and technology deals on behalf of its investors, prioritizing overseas projects. One of those projects included a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges in 2015, marking “the biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

One of Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners came to include Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC), which went bankrupt earlier this year. Senate investigators revealed in their September report that Ye held “significant connections” to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and previous affiliations with the People’s Liberation Party. The Senate report also revealed that Ye engaged in financial transactions with Joe Biden’s brother, James Biden, expanding the Biden family’s web of conflicting interests.

According to Senate, Ye and his associate Gongwen Dong provided Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James’ wife Sara Biden a $100,000 shopping spree that included extravagant items ranging from airplane tickets to Apple products. The transaction was flagged as potential criminal activity.

Reporting from the New York Post last week offered greater insight into the details of Ye and Hunter Biden’s working relationship. A second round of emails published by the Post on Oct. 15 shows Ye was offering Hunter Biden $10 million a year for “introductions alone.” Fox News confirmed the authenticity of the Post’s emails highlighting the lucrative offer, adding that sources with intimate knowledge of the potential contract said Joe Biden was slated to be dealt 10 percent of the cut funneled through Hunter.

Big Media Attempt to Delegitimize Blockbuster Revelations

While any new minor detail in President Donald Trump’s many media-manufactured scandals would immediately make front-page news and spike to the top trending subjects across online platforms, fresh reporting on the Biden family’s corruption scandals have been banned by social media, ignored by legacy outlets, and dismissed as right-wing conspiracies. This is the same media that exhaustively amplified every minor detail in the never-ending Russia hoax accusing Trump of being a Kremlin agent with an unverified and later debunked “dossier” that turned out to be Democrat-funded opposition research infected by Russian disinformation.

The Post’s blockbuster reporting on Hunter Biden’s apparent emails was immediately subjected to online censorship from Facebook and Twitter weaponizing their monopoly power over the 21st-century public square to suppress compromising information on their favored presidential candidate.

Twitter blocked the URL linking to the Post’s stories entirely and locked one of the nation’s oldest papers out of its own account. The social media giant responded to the wave of criticism that ensued by claiming the Post’s story violated the company’s rules on hacked content, a standard apparently selectively applied to stories it doesn’t like. Here are 11 other hacks, leaks and hoaxes outlined by Federalist Executive Editor Joy Pullmann that Twitter and Facebook didn’t censor because they hurt Trump.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized for the company’s PR disaster. Twitter then proceeded to censor the Post’s second major story the very next day that exposed Hunter Biden’s lucrative Chinese deals. As of Thursday morning, the Twitter account for the paper founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1801 remained suspended.

Facebook cited a similarly weak excuse to preemptively censor the New York Post’s reporting, claiming that before it could be shared, it first needed to face the company’s third-party fact-checkers in a decision announced by Facebook spokesperson and former Democratic staffer Andy Stone.

The Biden campaign hasn’t disputed the authenticity of the laptop’s emails.

The New York Post story dropped eight days ago. The Biden campaign has still not disputed a single fact in the story. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) October 22, 2020

Giuliani told the New York Times he gave the laptop information to the Post instead of another outlet because others “would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.”

He was right of course. The New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN completely ignored the story for hours after it was published. ABC, CBS, and NBC combined dedicated less than 15 minutes to the stories over 51 total hours of news programming. Former Clinton White House Communications Director George Stephanopoulos refused to ask Joe Biden a single question about the Post’s bombshell revelations in last week’s prime time town hall.

When Biden did field a question about the scandals plaguing his campaign in the final days to the election, the former vice president became combative and attacked the press.

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.” pic.twitter.com/Eo6VD4TqxD — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) October 17, 2020

Over the weekend, reporters were back to tossing softball questions, such as asking the Democratic candidate what kind of ice cream he bought.

On Monday, Biden called a 72-hour lid, or temporary cessation of campaigning, to avoid taking any more questions.

When the mainstream media did cover the Biden scandals, it attempted to delegitimize the New York Post’s reporting as taking the bait of a Russian operation to interfere in the upcoming election, a play by Democrats desperate to derail the Senate investigation into Biden earlier this year.

“A tabloid got a trove of data on Hunter Biden from Rudy Giuliani. Now the FBI is probing a possible disinformation campaign,” headlined USA Today.

“Is the Trump Campaign Colluding with Russia Again?” titled an op-ed in The New York Times.

“We know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN. Top intelligence officials quickly said that statement is false.

“nothing to see here. move along.” pic.twitter.com/FGYj4NEqxh — Logan Hall (@loganclarkhall) October 14, 2020

Claims that content found on Hunter Biden’s laptop stem from a Russian interference operation were promptly debunked by the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State.

“Let me be clear,” DNI Director John Ratcliffe said on Monday during an appearance on Fox Business. “The intelligence community doesn’t believe that because there is no intelligence that supports that.”

It's almost like Adam Schiff, the Dems & the media are all repeating false propaganda about ""Russian disinfo"" w/ ZERO EVIDENCE, to hide Joe Biden's corruption from the American people. “Hunter Biden’s laptop is NOT part of some Russian disinformation campaign.” – @DNI_Ratcliffe pic.twitter.com/BTuDo5uQC9 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 19, 2020

Secret Service records released by Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin Tuesday night also corroborated travel details outlined in the emails reported by the New York Post.

On Wednesday, Fox News reported that the Justice Department seized Hunter Biden’s laptop as part of a federal investigation into money laundering.

GOP Senators Chasing People And Docs To Verify Hunter Biden Emails,"Former Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski will be interviewed Friday by U.S. Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The interview follows the release of “documents regarding his business arrangements with Hunter Biden and others” from Bobulinski to the senators and their committees.

Bobulinski recently confirmed to The Federalist and others the authenticity of one of the emails featured in The New York Post’s bombshell reporting showing Hunter used his father’s position as vice president to leverage financial gain for his family.

The email, dated May 13, 2017, shows an offer for a contract worth $3 million a year for Hunter based on “introductions alone.” The email also outlined a plan to set aside 10 percent for “the big guy,” which Fox News reported was a reference for Joe Biden. Bobulinski confirmed that fact as well.

In addition to Bobulinski’s documents and upcoming interview, Johnson and Grassley also sent letters to Hunter Biden, James Biden, James Gilliar, and Rob Walker, requesting “bank records, wire transfers, account balances, gifts, business transactions, travel records, and communications about transactions” associated with a number of people named in the Post’s reported scandal, including Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The letters also request information about “transactions related to business in Romania, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Czech Republic, or any other countries.”

“According to recent reports that published emails allegedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop, the Committees have identified you as an individual involved in one or more of these business arrangements or financial transactions with Mr. Biden,” the letters say.

According to both senators, aside from Bobulinski, none of the recipients of the letter have “produced responsive documents to the Chairmen.”

“As part of the committees’ efforts to validate the authenticity of recently publicly released emails involving the Biden family’s international financial entanglements, we sent letters to five individuals identified in the emails. Those letters were sent yesterday, and the deadline is October 23, 2020,” the chairmen stated. “So far, the committees have received a response only from Mr. Tony Bobulinski, who appears to be willing to fully cooperate with our investigation. In fact, Mr. Bobulinski has already agreed to appear for an informal interview by the committees tomorrow, Friday, October 23, 2020.”

Johnson and Grassley released a report in late September “that revealed millions of dollars in questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals, including the wife of the former mayor of Moscow and individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.”

The report followed an investigation into “potential conflicts of interest” stemming from Hunter Biden’s involvement with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma during Joe Biden’s time as vice president handling Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

Big Tech Censorship Is Driving These Moms To Trump,"“How many of you heard about Twitter and Facebook censoring the Biden/Ukraine story?” I asked at our bi-monthly mom meet up, circled by kids outfitted with rainboots and homemade bows and arrows. Only two hands, juggling babies and lattes, went up. The five other moms rolled their eyes, utterly not shocked that Big Tech was functioning as their all-knowing nanny again.

The conversation quickly brought out familiar examples of media and Big Tech bias, from censoring #infantseizure on Facebook and redirecting to the Centers for Disease Control vaccine page, to downplaying riots and demonstrations (“When I’m driving with my kids downtown I need to know if ‘protestors’ are blocking freeway traffic”), to the definition of sexual preference (“We don’t change the dictionary!”). If Big Tech’s censorship goal is to turn users into political lemmings, these moms with two to seven kids in tow and ranging from age 29 to 48 aren’t having it.

“When something’s suppressed, it’s clear manipulation. We are being lied to, brainwashed,” one mom remarked as she handed bite-size pieces of granola bar to her toddler.

“It’s incredible when you open your eyes and realize how you have been played by the people that control the internet,” a mom and recent immigrant shared. “It makes me mad, anxious of not being able to find out what is true anymore.”

These women don’t care whether a vice presidential candidate is female, they just want to know hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness. And they are not outliers. They are representative of a large number of voters on this topic, according to a recent poll.

A recent Washington Examiner/YouGov poll found that “76% [of registered voters] thought social media companies had too much influence, compared to just 6% who said too little and 11% who picked about the right level of influence. The majority includes 82% of Republicans, 71% of Democrats, and 73% of independents.” In addition, the poll found that a majority of voters believe social media platforms are politically biased.

This newly formed Seattle meet-up, composed of both long-time conservatives as well as formerly apolitical moms activated by increasing leftist extremism, was the embodiment of that silent, tech-wary, majority.

“Big Tech censorship makes me feel like thought control and manipulation is the end goal,” one mom later messaged me. “When I find out that information is being suppressed or misrepresented for whatever reason, it makes me furious and I do not forget it. How are we supposed to make informed decisions for our families when we don’t have access to ALL of the information? I can certainly think for myself… I don’t need Facebook or Twitter to do that for me.”

If burying the Biden story was an attempt to shield the Democratic presidential candidate, Big Tech’s censorship is having the exact opposite effect on one mom. “These platforms are showing they cannot be trusted to be unbiased… whatever agenda or person they are protecting or pushing makes me research more and go and vote in the opposite direction.”

With women disproportionately hit by government shutdown job loss, increased child care demands due to shuttered schools, and concerned about riots and looting spilling into their communities, both presidential campaigns are closely monitoring the mom vote. For these mothers chatting by the play equipment, internet censorship has become an election year issue as well. Especially when it became obvious that, as one mom put it, social media outlets were “in bed with leftist parties.”

“Knowing that big tech is hiding a Trump campaign account for sharing information about the news relating to Hunter Biden and hiding articles and negative information about Joe Biden from other sources too, it feels like 1984 or China,” one mom remarked.

Widespread censorship has awakened a political animal in a few of these moms where none previously existed.

“To be honest, I didn’t believe censorship was happening until it happened firsthand to me,” one young Latina mom shared. “I wasn’t active in politics before. I hadn’t even voted before. But now that many of my personal posts have been blocked or removed, I am more motivated than ever to help keep our freedom of speech free.” Her first vote will be for the Republican ticket.

One formerly non-political mom admitted that she “never ever watched any politicians until COVID.” While she was anti-Hillary in 2016, she wasn’t a Trump fan. When the pandemic resulted in massive upheaval for her family of nine, she tuned into Trump’s daily coronavirus briefings.

“I realized that all the things I was holding against him [were] just based on rumors,” and then the blatant media bias became more obvious. “I would watch his speech, and immediately see people posting things about what he had said during the speeches and I could say absolutely, ‘That is not true!’ They were twisting his words and changing things to fit in their agenda!” While she doesn’t love that Trump has had “like seven wives,” the overt media and big tech manipulation has contributed to her “emphatic” vote for Trump in November.

Another mom shared that six months ago, she saw herself as a “solid centrist.” But “there’s no middle anymore.” She is very concerned about the “loss of objectivity” fueled by a biased media. She eventually felt that she had to “choose a side” and ended up choosing the party that was always on the wrong end of Big Tech “errors” and censorship. She didn’t mark her ballot for Trump in 2016, but this year her ballot will be “very very Republican.”

"On Biden Corruption, Democrats Reap Consequences Of Gentle Primary","In a healthy Democratic Party, Joe Biden’s primary opponents would have cared about his family’s documented habit of trading on their powerful last name, almost certainly with the former vice president’s knowledge. People can disagree over the scale of the corruption, whether it reflects only on Hunter and James or on Joe as well, but it’s unequivocal that influence peddling has been a steady pursuit for the Bidens.

Even as the corporate media downplays recent revelations about Hunter, The New York Times reported new documents from Tony Bubulinski that “show that the countries that Hunter Biden, James Biden and their associates planned to target for deals overlapped with nations where Joe Biden had previously been involved as vice president.”

“The records make clear that Hunter Biden saw the family name as a valuable asset, angrily citing his ‘family’s brand’ as a reason he is valuable to the proposed venture,” the Times noted. That name trading seems to have been explicit in some cases, as even Ben Smith of the Times tweeted on Tuesday.

Here’s part of an NBC News report from last October:

[A]s he accompanied his father to China, Hunter Biden was forming a Chinese private equity fund that associates said at the time was planning to raise big money, including from China. Hunter Biden has acknowledged meeting with Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker and his partner in the fund during the trip, although his spokesman says it was a social visit. The Chinese business license that brought the new fund into existence was issued by Shanghai authorities 10 days after the trip, with Hunter Biden a member of the board.

Hunter Biden took Air Force Two to meet with a Chinese banker who also happened to be his business partner, and 10 days later their fund’s license was approved, but we’re supposed to believe it was a “social visit”? And we’re supposed to believe the veep had no clue his son was meeting with business partners on their trip to China?

Crucially, we know Joe Biden lied about his knowledge of Hunter’s overseas business. There is, unfortunately, even some evidence he received financial benefits from it. The lie alone is reason for suspicion.

The point is that Democrats were negligent not to press this issue during the primaries. The evidence had been clearly reported by The New York Times, NBC, and other major outlets.

We’re certainly learning more now about Hunter’s work in places like Ukraine and China, but his intent to make money off the Biden name in either country was known to Democrats and media while his father was running in the primary. Curiously, however, Biden’s opponents pretty much ignored the entire story. This is incredible given that merely demonstrating Biden’s knowledge of the dealings would have been damning.

It’s also incredible given that Biden was competing against a slate of staunch, allegedly anti-establishment progressives who decried the influence of money in politics. Meanwhile, the son of their opponent, who happened to be the former vice president, was caught selling access to his father’s administration, raking in hefty sums based on this perceived ability to influence policy for a fee. Beyond being a powerful campaign attack, the issue raises serious questions about Joe Biden’s commitment to ethical conduct.

But nobody wanted to touch it. The negligence was so glaring that even Ezra Klein wrote a story last October headlined, “Sorry, but Democrats need to talk about Hunter Biden.”

“Democrats are afraid to talk about Hunter Biden. Trump won’t be,” said the subheading. In the piece, Klein argued, “Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.”

The New York Times described the Democratic field as “Tiptoeing Around Hunter Biden,” listing the gentle rebukes and firm disinterest Joe’s opponents mustered. So why the silence?

Writing in CNBC last December, Jake Novak contended, “It’s not a mystery why the Democrats who supposedly want to defeat Joe Biden for the nomination are so quiet about all this. They clearly don’t want to be seen as advancing President Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Hunter Biden deal.”

I think that’s correct. With the possibility that Biden would win the primary, the other candidates were also probably terrified of being cannibalized for damaging him beyond viability in the general election.

The result, however, is the second cycle in a row in which the Democratic Party has failed to use the primary process to vet its perceived frontrunner, which means it’s also the second cycle in a row in which Democrats have nominated an entrenched career politician weighed down by the baggage of corruption. This is exactly what happened in 2016, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) refused to really take off his gloves against Clinton, leaving the party ill-equipped for the general election.

As Klein predicted last year, Biden’s baggage hampers Democrats’ ability to knock the president over questions about his business too. As a self-styled enemy of the political establishment, Sanders alone should have torched Clinton and Biden over these issues.

It’s bad politics, sure. But it’s also an incredible disservice to voters, and this time it’s not merely the fault of the party’s establishment. Of course, finding a clean politician in a field of people vying for the presidency is like looking for a needle in a haystack. That’s still no excuse to leave the issue off the table.

I agree with Sen. Ted Cruz’s, R-Texas, assessment of the new email release. “I don’t think it moves a single voter,” he told Axios this week. I think that’s also probably true of Trump’s tax returns. On the right, voters’ cost-benefit-analysis is that any allegations of corruption against Trump are secondary to his policies and attitudes. On the left, honest voters admit allegations of corruption against Biden are secondary to his ability to oust Trump.

In a way, it’s fitting that Biden is running to “Build Back Better,” channeling nostalgia for the bipartisan glad-handing and smoke-filled backrooms of yore. If Democrats truly abhor the alleged corruption they’ve spent four years decrying, you’d think they might have shown a little more interest in following the money straight to Hunter.

Hiding Biden: How Dems Helped Defeat Trump In 2020,"By the numbers, Joe Biden is president of the United States because he won the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin by a combined total of some 43,000 votes.

But he also owes his victory to the groundwork laid by Democrats and their media allies one year before, during the first impeachment of Donald Trump over his supposedly strings-attached demand that the Ukrainian government investigate alleged corruption involving Biden’s son, Hunter.

The first impeachment failed to oust Trump from office, but it helped secure the White House for Biden. It shielded him from scrutiny, enabling him and his supporters to cast allegations during the campaign about dubious Biden family business ties as rehashed Trumpian conspiracy theories.

Biden’s razor-thin swing state victories might not have materialized if the Trump campaign had been able to gain traction from its October Surprise — a series of articles it helped orchestrate in the New York Post that reported information from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden suggesting corrupt foreign business deals that may have involved his father.

As many as 45 percent of Biden voters said they were unaware of Hunter’s financial scandals before the election. That’s likely because Democrats and much of the media discredited or did not report the accusations in the final weeks of the campaign — accusations that were bolstered after the election when Hunter admitted that he has been the subject of an ongoing federal corruption probe since 2018.

Once the Post ran its first laptop article on Oct. 14, Democrats and their allies immediately turned to the narrative they had long used against Trump: foreign interference. Without evidence save for the claims of Democrat partisans and anonymous official sources — like those commonly relied upon during the debunked Trump-Russia affair — the New York Times, Washington Post, and Politico ran stories suggesting the laptop could be Russian disinformation. Joe Biden said the laptop was a “Russian plan” at the first presidential debate. The FBI, which was a main driver of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, added to the narrative when word was leaked that the bureau was investigating whether the laptop emails were Russian disinformation. Twitter and Facebook reacted by actively censoring the Hunter Biden story. Twitter went so far as to lock the New York Post out of its own account.

As the Senate takes up a second impeachment of Trump, Republican objections to the Democrats’ handling of the first go-round loom large. The record of those proceedings shows that they were conducted in a highly unusual manner. In retrospect, it seems clear that they were designed not just to target Trump — but to protect Biden.

Taking Early Aim

Some Democrats were bent on impeaching Trump from the moment he took office, on Jan. 20, 2017. Just 19 minutes after Trump was sworn in, the Washington Post published a piece headlined, “The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.”

Those early efforts were spearheaded by Texas Rep. Al Green, who drew up articles of impeachment for alleged misdeeds ranging from Trump’s insulting kneeling professional football players to his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Green’s effort led to three different unsuccessful impeachment votes — one in 2017 and two more in 2019 after Democrats gained a House majority in the 2018 election.

Publicly, Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders said they did not approve of Green’s efforts. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” the House speaker told the Washington Post in March 2019.

Privately, Democratic leaders were betting Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump-Russia collusion would produce a clearly impeachable offense.

They were wrong. After three years of thorough investigation — as well as thousands of breathless articles and untold hours of TV coverage keyed toward Trump’s prospective guilt — Mueller’s final report, issued in March 2019, concluded that the probe “[did] not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Mueller did not make a determination of whether Trump had tried to obstruct his investigation. Looking at the evidence, Attorney General William Barr determined he had not.

Nevertheless, some powerful Democrats sought to use the Mueller report as the basis to impeach Trump, only to be rebuffed by Pelosi.

The speed of what happened next blindsided Republicans.

The Ukraine Affair

In early August, a CIA employee filed a formal whistleblower complaint against President Trump aimed at forcing Congress to address the matter. He alleged that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens for political purposes, and subsequently made aid to Ukraine contingent on the probe.

Trump reportedly raised the issue because he believed there had never been any serious inquiry into why Hunter Biden, a lawyer with no experience in the energy sector, had been paid upwards of $80,000 a month to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. Hunter received the appointment in 2014, shortly after his father was asked to oversee Ukrainian affairs as Barack Obama’s vice president. In 2016, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor widely considered to be ineffective. The fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, testified that he was driven from office because he was investigating Burisma.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son,” Trump told Zelensky, “that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. … It sounds horrible to me.”

At the time of the whistleblower complaint, Biden was favored to win the Democratic nomination for president.

However, the allegations regarding the Trump phone call with Zelensky were problematic from the start. The man who brought the complaint was not really a whistleblower as the term is commonly understood. He had no direct knowledge of the phone call but had been leaked details of it by one of the seven American officials who were on the call with the president.

The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel, whose legal opinions are normally binding on these matters, soon concluded the whistleblower complaint did not meet the requirements of an “urgent concern” for it to be forwarded to Congress.

Meanwhile, Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, worked to surface the details of the complaint publicly. He recast obstacles to legitimizing the whistleblower’s complaint as attempts to hide Trump’s malfeasance. When the White House ultimately made a transcript of the call public, Trump’s rhetorical style, an odd combination of obliqueness and bluntness, made the idea of a quid pro quo — no Biden investigation, no aid — open to interpretation.

Officials from Ukraine, which did not open an investigation, said they never felt pressured by Trump.

Despite the procedural problems with the whistleblower complaint, it provided a semblance of formal process to buttress an all-new impeachment attempt. Progressives and much of the media cast the call as an abuse of power by Trump who, they claimed, tried to extort a foreign leader to kneecap a political rival. A formal House impeachment inquiry was launched on Sept. 24, 2019, with the full support of Democratic House leadership.

From the beginning, the impeachment inquiry was rife with episodes suggesting Democrats had a larger strategy. To begin with, they took an unprecedented amount of control over the process. With the 2020 election and the prospect of a second Trump term looming, there would be no years-long special counsel or nonpartisan investigation of this matter.

While the Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, was the traditional venue for impeachment, Democrats decided that Schiff would guide the impeachment inquiry through the Intelligence Committee.

Schiff, who had raised his national profile during the Mueller probe by repeatedly claiming that he had seen more than circumstantial evidence that Trump had colluded with Russia, had already acquired a reputation for fierce partisanship. In early October, shortly after the impeachment inquiry began, the New York Times reported that Schiff’s office had helped shepherd the alleged whistleblower’s complaint. The Washington Post fact-checker gave Schiff “four Pinocchios” for repeatedly denying his office’s contact with the man. Nevertheless, Schiff received glowing press coverage for his impeachment efforts.

The corporate press further enabled impeachment by refusing to publish the whistleblower’s name, in line with Democrat admonitions, even though he wasn’t formally protected by any whistleblower laws. News organizations disclosed no agreements of source confidentiality with the man, and his identity was common knowledge in Washington.

When Paul Sperry of RealClearInvestigations reported the evidence that the whistleblower was a then-33-year-old CIA employee named Eric Ciaramella, this news blackout by major media allowed them to ignore his history of partisan ties and anti-Trump statements. Sperry reported that Ciaramella had served as an adviser on Ukraine to Vice President Biden and had been overheard in 2017 discussing with another staffer how to “take out,” or remove, the new president from office.

That colleague was Sean Misko, who left the White House in the summer of 2019 to join House impeachment manager Schiff’s committee, where, sources say, he offered “guidance” to the whistleblower. [Update, Feb. 5, 2021, 2:30 PM Eastern: In a statement dated Jan. 3, sent after publication and RCI’s request beforehand for comment, Schiff’s panel said “Misko never met with or provided guidance to any whistleblowers regarding complaints they wished to file, including the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower” and reports otherwise are “false.”]

Aside from Schiff’s backstage dealings with Ciaramella, the Intelligence Committee chairman publicly tried to spin Trump’s alleged wrongdoing. On Sept. 26, the day after the Trump-Zelensky transcript was released, Schiff gave an opening statement before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before his committee.

During the statement, Schiff, who had once been an aspiring screenwriter, characterized the president’s behavior on the Zelensky call as being like “a classic organized crime shakedown.” Instead of reading the plain text of the call, Schiff paraphrased what happened in hyperbolic and lurid terms.

“I have a favor I want from you,” Schiff said while seeming to read from a transcript. “And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.”

Republicans were appalled.

“He makes up a conversation supposedly between the president and Ukraine which sounds like a script from a cheap comic book. Lies and innuendo. He was called out on it and said, well, I meant it as a parody. Geez, that’s great. The fun begins,” Utah Congressman Chris Stewart would record in his journal, as quoted in “Obsession,” Washington Examiner reporter Byron York’s book on Democrats’ years-long quest to remove Trump from office.

Leaking Testimony

To make the case for impeachment, it was crucial for Democrats to demonstrate the existence of a quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky, which was ambiguous because Trump never mentioned aid on the call.

Schiff responded to Republicans’ witness Kurt Volker’s testimony by taking even more unprecedented steps for Democrats to control the impeachment proceedings. Volker had sat for what was known as a “transcribed interview,” which allowed Republicans to speak about the testimony afterward. After Volker, Schiff made sure all the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry were deposed, forbidding committee members from discussing what was said publicly.

But the secrecy rules had a convenient and glaring exception — the witnesses themselves could speak about what happened. “The sessions settled into a pattern of secret testimony accompanied by quick leaks of witnesses’ opening statements,” York observes in “Obsession.” The leaked, one-sided testimonies allowed press speculation to run wild, while House Republicans who knew the particulars were subject to ethics charges if they told the public what had actually been said.

The DNC-Ukraine Nexus

For Democrats, Biden was a fraught issue in the impeachment proceedings. One obvious defense of Trump was for Republicans to argue that the president’s questions about Biden family corruption in Ukraine were legitimate and necessary to protect national security. Under questioning, multiple witnesses called by Democrats conceded that Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma was concerning, leading to calls for Hunter to testify in the proceedings. (During the subsequent Senate impeachment trial, one Democratic senator, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, said Hunter Biden was a relevant witness.)

Democrats rejected calls to question Hunter Biden, Ciaramella, and others. “I think we really could have torpedoed impeachment by making the whistleblower detail all of his prior contacts with Schiff and also his prior contacts with Biden as well,” said a Republican House staffer with intimate knowledge of the proceedings who requested anonymity because he did not want to speak for elected officials.

Democrats also shut down Republican attempts to probe the Democratic Party’s own troubling connections to Ukraine during impeachment. A Politico investigation published in January 2017 “found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the [2016] race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another’s elections.”

The article, written by David Stern and Kenneth Vogel, the latter now at the New York Times, reported that Ukrainian officials had helped Hillary “Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers,” including his campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Key to this effort was a Democratic National Committee operative, Alexandra Chalupa, who met with Ukrainian officials and American journalists in Washington and was invited to the White House by Biden’s Ukraine pointman — the future “whistleblower” Ciaramella.

(Chalupa wasn’t the only Democratic operative pushing Manafort dirt originating in Ukraine at about the same time. So was Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, the Democratic contractor behind the discredited Steele dossier on Trump-Russia collusion. He has acknowledged feeding the media Ukraine tips in “Crime in Progress,” the book he co-wrote with his Fusion co-founder Peter Fritsch.)

But even though Politico’s reporting on Ukraine and the DNC was largely unquestioned for three years, the media once again sprang to Democrats’ defense as Republicans sought to make an issue of it.

In the end, Schiff’s secrecy and tight control over who got to testify allowed House Democrats to sidestep any explosive questions about the chairman’s role in instigating impeachment, the DNC’s involvement with Ukraine, and Biden’s potential role in his son’s corruption.

Ultimately, the Senate refused to convict Trump and many Republicans believed that it did little to harm him politically. “Not a single Democrat speaker referenced impeachment during any of the convention, which is a really amazing thing,” the GOP staffer noted. “That just shows me they didn’t get a whole lot of political benefit out of it.”

Shielding Joe

But if impeachment failed to tarnish Trump as much as Democrats hoped, it appeared successful in delegitimizing valid questions about alleged Biden corruption. After impeachment, the corporate media showed almost no interest in investigating Biden family business ties, which were largely characterized as a series of unsubstantiated and debunked allegations.

Christiane Amanpour of PBS expressed the prevailing view in an interview with Republican National Committee spokeswoman Liz Harrington when she said “there has never been any issues in terms of corruption” with the Bidens. After Harrington disagreed and urged journalists to look into the story, Amanpour responded: “We’re not going to do your work for you.”

Some coverage transformed the potential scandals into a positive for Biden. At a campaign event in Iowa, a Democratic voter asked the candidate in December 2019 about allegations of his son’s corruption. In response, Biden called the voter a “damn liar” and challenged him to an IQ test. CNN national political reporter Maeve Reston characterized the exchange this way: “In a human moment defending his son, Biden showed the authenticity, emotion and readiness for a fight that appeals to so many Democrats as they look for someone who can take on Trump.”

Last September, when a Senate intelligence panel report revealed that a firm co-founded by Hunter Biden received a $3.5-million wire transfer from the wife of a Russian politician, the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC did not cover the story. When Trump raised the issue at the first presidential debate, Biden claimed it had been “totally discredited” even though its existence was confirmed by Treasury Department documents.

This news blackout may have helped propel Biden to victory, but questions regarding the Bidens have not gone away.

There is the laptop, which, far from Russian disinformation, did indeed belong to Hunter Biden, who in December admitted he has been the subject of a federal corruption probe since 2018.

Other evidence and testimony implicate President Biden. Tony Bobulinski, a former naval officer and business partner with Hunter Biden, asserted in October that he met with the senior Biden as part of a plan to secretly give the future president a 10 percent stake in a deal with a Chinese conglomerate with ties to the country’s communist government. Bobulinski has provided documents to back up his account and news outlets such as the Wall Street Journal have confirmed they are authentic.

President Biden seems aware of the danger of family embarrassments, including from a January 2020 FBI raid involving allegations of financial fraud at a company where Biden’s brother James was listed as “principal.” Politico reported last week that the president had pulled his brother Frank aside last summer to tell him, “For Christ’s sake, watch yourself. Don’t get sucked into something that would, first of all, hurt you.” On Inauguration Day, a law firm’s ad promoting Frank Biden’s relationship with the president caused a new stir.

Such Biden family matters, and Republicans’ awareness that their concealment may have helped seal Trump’s defeat, color Democrats’ upcoming long-shot efforts to convince at least 17 senators of the opposite party to join their legally and politically fraught effort to convict a president in an impeachment trial after he has left office. Republicans think the Democrats’ handling of the first impeachment poisoned the well.

“Republican fence sitters are probably already on the record denouncing the unfairness of the House process last time around, since both GOP House members and senators were doing that,” says a GOP staffer who insisted on anonymity. “So if that process was unfair, how can you trust Democrats enough to sign off on impeachment 2.0, when there wasn’t even any process to speak of at all?” A number of House Democrats involved in the first impeachment declined to comment on their Republican colleagues’ concerns.

In a recent vote, 45 Republican senators went on record saying they did not believe impeaching a former president was constitutional. Even prominent Senate Democrats, such as 2016 vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, are advocating censuring Donald Trump for fear that a bitter and drawn out impeachment trial is not only futile but will hamper Biden’s ability to get his administration up and running during the crucial early months of the presidency.

Congressional Republicans, for their part, have shown no signs of dropping efforts begun in the first impeachment to investigate what they see as clear Biden family corruption — even after Trump’s second impeachment. Prominent Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham and Charles Grassley, recently told Fox News they plan to ask Joe Biden’s nominee for attorney general, Merrick Garland, about the Hunter Biden corruption probe during his nomination hearing.

"When Trump Pauses Funds, It’s Illegal. When Biden Does It, It’s Fine","Last Congress, many Democrats, including Rep. John Yarmuth, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, claimed the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) broke the law when it paused the obligation of funds to Ukraine for 50 days to determine the best use for them.

On the very first day of his administration, however, President Biden directed that funding specifically appropriated to build the wall along the southern border be paused for 60 days to determine how best to spend those funds. Press reports indicate that all funding for the wall construction has stopped.

Biden has now held these funds longer than OMB held the Ukraine funding. But Yarmuth has stayed silent about the Biden hold on funds, demonstrating that the congressman cares nothing about the law and only about partisan politics. In contrast to this hypocritical silence, 40 Republican senators have requested that GAO look into whether the Biden hold is unlawful.

As OMB general counsel during the Trump administration, I authorized the Ukraine funds pause so President Trump could consider the best use of those funds, consistent with the law and his policy. Although those funds were designated for Ukraine, there were a variety of ways they could be spent to benefit the government of Ukraine, from purchasing weapons to blankets. This pause was entirely appropriate and legal, and once the president made a decision OMB made the funds available and they were obligated before the end of the fiscal year.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO), which is simply an instrumentality of Congress, rushed out an opinion during the failed partisan impeachment effort claiming that OMB had violated the Impoundment Control Act by pausing the spending of those Ukraine funds. GAO concluded that the president could never pause funds to conduct a policy review to determine the best use of those funds, even if the law allowed for a variety of ways for the funds to be spent.

Based on this GAO reasoning, President Biden’s order is an unlawful act and a violation of the Impoundment Control Act. Yet Yarmuth, who accused the Trump OMB’s of breaking the law for pausing funds and cited this very GAO opinion, has not raised a single objection to President Biden’s hold. GAO has also remained silent and done nothing. This is plainly hypocrisy and the use of double standards.

OMB’s pause on the obligation of the Ukraine funds was in fact perfectly legal and appropriate pending a policy review. GAO’s opinion (and Yarmuth’s position) is legally wrong. It’s also reckless to argue that a president does not have the discretion to determine how best to spend funds when the law in fact provides that discretion.

For example, last year, as it has done for many years, Congress appropriated a lump sum of funding to the State Department for international organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) is one of those qualifying international organizations, but President Trump did not want to provide funding to WHO because of its complicity in aiding China in lying and covering up the spread of COVID 19. As OMB general counsel, I determined that the president had the legal authority to pause the obligation of those funds to determine where best to spend them, and the funds were obligated to other international organizations, consistent with the law.

But since GAO rejects this executive branch latitude with respect to pausing funds for a policy review, GAO has no option other than to find that President Biden’s pause of the border wall funds for a policy review is unlawful. It should forthwith issue an opinion stating that the Biden administration has broken the law.

Most important, Yarmuth, based on his support of GAO’s position and his accusations last year, should publicly object to the Biden administration’s hold or admit he was simply playing partisan politics when he criticized OMB for pausing funding during the Trump administration to determine how best to spend those funds. But I won’t hold my breath.

This Article Is A Textbook Example Of Media Running PR For Democrats,"A recent Politico article by Caitlin Emma on President Joe Biden’s hold of funding for border wall construction provides a perfect example of the press running cover for the Biden administration. Almost every sentence is designed to excuse or defend Biden’s action, and of course smear the Trump team in the process.

Biden’s executive order on Jan. 20 ordered a hold on all funds being used for the construction of the wall along the U.S. southern border, including funds Congress specifically appropriated for border wall construction. Based on the Government Accountability Office’s opinion finding that the Trump administration violated the law for pausing Ukraine funding in the same manner, it would seem like a slam dunk that Biden’s hold is illegal.

While the headline states Biden “is under fire,” almost every sentence in the story is designed to defend Biden’s actions, beginning with the rest of the title that says Biden would merely be a “rule-breaker” if it was determined he violated federal law. In the same story, there are no references to “rule breaking” for the same action by Trump’s Office of Management and Budget pausing the Ukraine funds. The word used? “Illegal.”

Politico blindly accepts the Biden OMB official’s defense that Biden’s hold was publicly announced, while the Trump OMB’s hold was secret. This distinction has zero relevance to whether the hold violates federal law. But you would not know that reading this article.

Politico also reprints the Biden OMB’s official distinction that the Biden hold was not done by using OMB’s apportionment power, as the Trump OMB did with Ukraine funding. Whether OMB is using its apportionment power or an agency is holding the funds is irrelevant to whether this is legal.

The article later implies that Trump used these same tactics to pause funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), but links to a story that literally begins with President Trump announcing the hold. And OMB’s apportionment authority was not used to pause WHO funding.

Politico also prints a Biden OMB official’s statement that the Trump OMB tried to “permanently tie up [Ukraine funds] by taking action right before the annual spending deadline.” That’s false.

Those Ukraine funds were first paused informally beginning in mid-June of 2019, more than three months before the end of the fiscal year. OMB’s first apportionment footnote holding those funds was placed on July 25. These dates are not even close to the Sept. 30 fiscal year deadline. Those funds were in fact released and obligated.

Politico writes approvingly that White House officials defend the hold because it was necessary to “come up with a plan to spend the money.” That is exactly what the Trump OMB argued when pausing the Ukraine funds, and GAO rejected this argument. It instead found that the administration can’t pause funds for a policy review to determine how best to spend the money.

Politico wrote that the Trump OMB’s justification for holding the funds to conduct a policy review was “vehemently swatted down [by GAO], citing the president’s policy and political ambitions.” That’s false. There is not a single reference in GAO’s opinion to Trump’s “political ambitions.” Or any political ambitions. GAO focused on OMB’s justification for hold.

Biden’s OMB official states the funds are being held consistent with appropriations law. Reports are that all construction work is frozen, and based on GAO’s opinion, this would violate appropriations law. OMB undoubtedly believes it is permissible to hold funds for a policy review because that was the exact same position the Trump OMB took. But GAO and congressional Democrats rejected that position. Politico’s article did not challenge this at all.

Speaking of congressional Democrats and Politico’s partisan slant, the article writes approvingly of House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth and his supposed nonpartisan desire to strengthen Congress’s power of the purse, but the article not once challenges Yarmuth for being utterly silent during the Biden administration’s pause of congressionally appropriated funds, despite his obsession with just such executive actions during the Trump administration. This is especially interesting as Politico—even this same Politico journalist—parroted every accusatory Yarmuth press release during the last administration.

Politico ends its supposed straight news article by noting that the Biden administration “has also promised to release the money if the pause violated congressional intent.” Under GAO’s legal analysis, pausing funds violates the law. Unfreezing the money would be a welcome development, but according to GAO’s opinion, it would be “too little, too late” to avoid being an illegal impoundment.

Biden has already violated his executive order deadline to have a plan within 60 days to spend these funds. It’s day 85 and there is no plan, and no evidence that a plan is coming any time soon.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has stated that the border wall funds appropriated by Congress are “still moving forward,” but press reports indicate all funds are frozen. This appears to be a false statement, but no one in the crack media corps, including Politico, is fact-checking this apparently false claim.

What is going on here? This story, like so many stories, is written with false facts and false narratives to cover for Biden, and of course smear Trump. Politico never contacted a Trump OMB official to get their side of the story. This isn’t journalism, this is being part of Team Biden.

DOJ Targets Journalist Investigating Biden Family Ukraine Scandals,"As part of an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the Biden Justice Department is seizing communications between the former mayor and a journalist investigating President Joe Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine.

Agents from the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office and the FBI raided the New York residence of Giuliani early Wednesday morning. The investigation stems from at least a two-year-old probe into potential crimes of federal lobbying laws. Federal investigators seized Giuliani’s electronic devices.

The warrant presented, however, according to Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert Costello, raises questions surrounding the scope and motivation behind the investigation, where prosecutors began issuing subpoenas around the same time of Trump’s first impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats centered on conduct in Ukraine in 2019.

According to the Wall Street Journal, “Costello said the warrant sought communications between Mr. Giuliani and individuals including John Solomon, a columnist who was in communication with Mr. Giuliani about his effort to push for Ukrainian investigations of President Biden before he was elected.”

Giuliani began to probe the Biden’s family’s business ventures in the same country, where then-presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served in a lucrative board role of a notoriously corrupt energy company despite no prior experience in the industry.

Solomon, an investigative journalist, did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

The FBI has been particularly prone to politically motivated investigations in recent years following its deep-state operation to oust Trump before the Republican executive even took office. Operation Crossfire Hurricane peeled back the curtain on a primary intelligence agency run at the behest of its former Director James Comey compromised by Democrat interests. The operation promoted the conspiracy theory Trump was a covert Russian agent for years – a narrative that ultimately took deep roots among a polarized population where one-half remains convinced of its truth.

A two-year special counsel investigation, however, exonerated Trump of the charges.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/29/doj-targets-journalist-investigating-biden-family-ukraine-scandals/,2021-04-29
"To Defend Its Freedom, Taiwan Must Create A National Guard","Taiwan is a self-ruled democratic republic of almost 24 million people and one of the freest nations on the planet. Unfortunately for Taiwan, it sits some 90 miles away from the People’s Republic of China across the Taiwan Strait.

The 1.4 billion people of the PRC are ruled by the Chinese Communist Party in a one-party totalitarian state under Chairman Xi Jinping. For more than a generation, the PRC has considered Taiwan a renegade province to be retaken, by force if needed.

Over the past two years, Taiwan’s determination to maintain its defenses was boosted as it watched the PRC violate its international agreements promising to maintain Hong Kong’s “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement. This recent absorption of Hong Kong into the PRC with little in the way of consequential international condemnation reaffirmed to Taiwan that Beijing cannot be trusted, while potentially signaling to the CCP it might do the same to Taiwan with fewer negative ramifications than previously anticipated.

Indeed, witnessing Hong Kong’s loss of freedom at the hands of the PRC accelerated a long-term trend of increasing Taiwanese nationalism. Today, 83 percent of Taiwanese, a record high, view themselves as uniquely “Taiwanese” and not “Chinese” or both. Relatedly, 77.6 percent of Taiwanese said they would fight for their freedom should the PRC invade Taiwan.

A willingness to fight and actually fighting are two entirely different things, however. Taiwan’s active-duty military stands at about 165,000 with another 1.7 million reservists. This is down considerably from 2014, when Taiwan’s active force was about 290,000, reflecting a shift away from a reliance on conscripts to an all-volunteer force.

On paper, Taiwan’s reserve strength appears impressive. But it has fundamental weaknesses that render it vulnerable in the most likely scenarios Taiwan may face when defending itself against a vengeful PRC led by the Chinese Communist Party.

Woefully Inadequate Training

In an announcement made three months ago, Taiwan’s military command said it will call up its reservists for two weeks of training every year, but only as a test for 3,000 reservists before a full-scale launch by 2024. Today, a portion of the 770,000 military reservists who left active duty within eight the past years receive only five to seven days of training every other year.

By comparison, in the United States, the 535,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard train a minimum of 38 to 39 days a year. Many soldiers serve more than that as they prepare for mobilization or attend specialty and leadership courses. As such, Taiwan’s reservists today receive about 8 percent of the annual training their U.S. Army counterparts. By 2024, if Taiwan’s program to increase training is implemented, Taiwanese reservists will train about 36 percent as much as do American reservists.

This is simply not enough training. When reservists receive well-planned and realistic military training, their proficiency and morale improve. Just as important, when a larger segment of the community — professionals, business people, and workers — are seen preparing to defend the nation, it also galvanizes the public.

To be sure, training and equipment are of vital importance to the effectiveness of a reserve force, yet military doctrine is crucial as well. America has the luxury of strategic depth. Its reserve forces have the gift of time in that most major conflicts requiring their mobilization will develop overseas. This allows for an orderly and considered mobilization and train-up period before deployment.

Taiwan does not have the luxury of time. The PRC can initiate hostilities in minutes, bringing the entirety of Taiwan under intense missile fire and airstrikes. Furthermore, the PRC’s battle plans likely include a focus on Taiwan’s command, control, and communications systems. The ability for Taiwan’s government to call up its reserves and deploy them in a meaningful way will be extremely difficult in a conflict. In short, it is quite doubtful Taiwan’s reserves will provide any militarily significant contribution in the decisive first ten days of battle.

On the contrary, early mobilization of Taiwan’s reserve forces based on intelligence warnings and indicators on an impending PRC attack will be politically problematic. As CCP General Secretary Xi has ordered his military forces to ramp up air and naval operations in and around the Taiwan Strait, the heightened threat posture reduces Taiwan’s reaction time while deadening Taiwan’s military leadership to an imminent attack (something Egypt successfully did to Israel in the six months leading up to the 1973 Yom Kippur War).

Why Reorganizations is Needed

The PRC’s increased operational tempo also produces a “psychological attack” effect against Taiwan. This psychological warfare intends to reduce Taiwan’s will to fight, although the opposite can occur as well as a nation rises to meet the threat.

Were Taiwan’s civilian leadership to consider mobilizing the reserves, there would be tremendous pressure from the island’s business community not to disrupt its workforce or the markets. The political ramifications could be severe as well.

Yet there is a much better way for Taiwan to organize its reserves if Taiwan is willing to have a sharp break from its past. Previously, the Nationalist military from mainland China was viewed by many native Taiwanese as an occupying force at the same time Chiang Kai-shek’s army viewed much of the populace as untrustworthy. Understandably, this led to a system that eschewed local defense organizations since those organizations could become the seeds of rebellion.

Since the sense of Taiwanese identity has grown, the chance of a decentralized reserve system becoming a threat to the government is minimal, although vetting would be needed to prevent PRC sympathizers from gaining operational control of a local Guard unit.

As a result, Taiwan should immediately consider establishing an Army National Guard-like reserve model. As in America, this model would feature local armories housing platoons (40-50 personnel), companies (120 to 200), as well as battalion and brigade headquarters. Frequent training would be conducted in the armories, where virtual training equipment would be located. The facilities would also prove useful in recruiting as well as in responding to natural disasters.

Preparing for the Worst

Each local Taiwan Guard unit would be made responsible for defending key points and infrastructure upon mobilization or at the first sign of an attack by the PRC. Taiwan’s geography has long been assumed to be a force multiplier that favors the defense, something that became increasingly clear during an extensive map exercise and war game I designed for Taiwan as part of my research to write my book, “China Attacks.”

In the event of a surprise attack, Taiwanese Guard soldiers would self-report without orders. Units would be equipped as infantry taskforces with rifles, mortars, antitank missiles, antiaircraft missiles, UAVs, communications gear (including the ability to upload live feeds via satellite), and older armored vehicles.

Even if half these units were to successfully mobilize and take up defensive positions, it would greatly complicate the goal of the People’s Liberation Army to rapidly defeat Taiwan’s active army after a successful amphibious and airborne assault. As a conflict progressed, these local units could be aggregated into larger maneuver units, either as part of the Taiwan Guard or active duty elements.

Due to the growing PRC missile threat, however, an armory’s weapons and equipment would be vulnerable to destruction at the onset of an attack. A solution to this would be to use mobile storage safes or armored carriers.

For instance, rifles would be stored in one container while rifle bolts and ammunition would be stored in the other with separate keys, or combinations, needed to unlock both. This would make it more difficult for the small full-time cadre — typically, two to four personnel — to be overpowered by criminal elements intent on stealing military hardware. At the same time, it would make it nearly impossible for the PRC to destroy the essential equipment of the reserves in the opening moves of an attack.

Lastly, a Taiwan Guard initiative could benefit from an international exchange program started in 1993 as the Cold War ended. The State Partnership Program paired state National Guard commands with counterparts in Central and Eastern Europe.

For instance, during my service as an intelligence officer in the California Army National Guard, I had the opportunity to train with counterparts from Ukraine. Ukraine sent its reservists to California to train and the California Guard sent its Guard members to Ukraine. Furthermore, the use of citizen soldiers in this capacity would be less provocative than an active-duty exchange while at the same time providing confidence to the Taiwanese of the utility of a professionally trained reserve force.

The opening days of a PRC attempt to conquer Taiwan will be critical. Signs of successful resistance, broadcast both internally and internationally, will largely shape the domestic will to fight as well as the international willingness to come to Taiwan’s aid.

If Taiwan survives its encounter with the PRC, the potential for unrest in mainland China would be extreme. A viable Taiwan Guard force would serve as a strong deterrent to the Chinese Communist Party’s aggressive designs aimed at snuffing out Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.

Hunter Biden Played Key Role In Deal With Democratic Firm Under Investigation,"President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, reportedly played a pivotal role in securing a deal between the Democrat consulting firm Blue Star Strategies and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

In 2015, Burisma — where Hunter Biden raked in upwards of $50,000 per month in excess compensation despite no prior energy experience — hired Blue Star Strategies in a deal which Hunter Biden served as the primary conduit, according to the Washington Free Beacon Wednesday.

Citing emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop, the Free Beacon reported Hunter Biden wrote to Burisma executive Vadym Pozharski in 2015 encouraging Pozharski to hire Blue Star in effort to court U.S. suport for the Ukrainian company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Zlochevsky was under investigation by the United Kingdom for paying alleged bribes to secure drilling contracts.

Last fall, Senate investigators also accused Zlochevsky of paying a $7 million dollar bribe to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office to close other investigations in Ukraine and release $23 million in assets frozen by British officials.

“You should go ahead and sign,” Hunter Biden wrote to Pozharski of the Blue Star contract. “Looking forward to getting started on this.”

Blue Star Strategies is owned by former Clinton Administration officials Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano.

According to the Free Beacon, the “ultimate purpose” of the partnership was to shut down cases against Zlochevsky.

“Neither Biden nor the Blue Star founders registered their work under the Lobbying Disclosure Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” the Free Beacon reported.

The arrangement, meanwhile, is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware as part of a probe reported by Politico into Biden’s taxes and whether Blue Star violated foreign agent laws.

Another trove of emails published by the New York Post in May also shed light on Biden’s conflicts of interest surrounding his potentially criminal overseas business ventures while his father served as the Obama White House’s “public face” on Ukraine.

Emails show then-Vice President Joe Biden met with several of Hunter Biden’s business partners at an exclusive Georgetown restaurant in 2015, as opposed to merely Pozharski as revealed in October.

Recent revelations surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings have also been plagued by personal scandal.

According to an audiotape published by the Daily Mail, Hunter Biden is heard bragging to a friend about smoking crack with former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, an infamous addict who once served six months in federal prison after a 1990 FBI sting operation. In the recording, Hunter Biden said the two smoked crack in the bathroom of a local bar while Hunter was a junior at Georgetown University, contradicting his own memoir where he wrote that a teenage arrest scared him from drugs until after college.

New text messages also published by the Daily Mail this week accuse Hunter Biden of repeatedly calling his white attorney the N-word in 2018 and 2019.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/09/hunter-biden-played-pivotal-role-in-deal-with-democratic-strategists-under-federal-investigation/,2021-06-09

"January 6 Commission Show Trial Witnesses Repped by Russian Collusion, Ukraine Impeachment, Kavanaugh Rape Hoaxers","The attorneys representing two Capitol police officers before the House Select Committee on January 6 Tuesday expose the partisan probe as nothing more than a Democrat show trial to impeach Republican voters after twice failing to impeach former President Donald Trump.

On Thursday, attorney and Lincoln Project fanboy David Laufman tweeted his excitement to represent Officers Harry Dunn and Aquilino Gonell alongside left-wing D.C. attorney Mark Zaid.

“Proud to join [Mark Zaid] in representing brave Capitol Police officers,” Laufman wrote. “They will tell the truth of what really happened that day.”

Both attorneys have a history of representing clients in high-profile cases with nefarious motives.

In 2018, Laufman represented the “beach friend” of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser of sexual misconduct Christine Blasey-Ford. Three years after coming forward with graphic claims, Ford still has never proven the two had ever even met, let alone offer a corroborating witness.

Laufman served as legal counsel for Monica McLean, a former FBI agent and friend of Blasey Ford’s who had allegedly been coached ahead of a polygraph test which amounted to witness tampering.

The former DOJ official who used to work in the national security division also worked with disgraced former corrupt FBI agent Peter Strzok on both the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and the deep state investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign based on the debunked Steele Dossier.

Zaid represented the alleged whistleblower named by RealClearInvestigations in 2019 as Eric Ciaramella in Trump’s first impeachment. A search through the anti-Trump whistleblower’s attorney exposed a clear agenda preceding the Democrats’ first effort to achieve the top policy item of their Trump-era platform: the ousting of the Democratically-elected president either through means of impeachment, a deep-state coup, or “#rebellion.”

It's very scary. We will get rid of him, and this country is strong enough to survive even him and his supporters. We have to. — Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) July 2, 2017

And 45 years from now we might be recalling stories regarding the impeachment of @realDonaldTrump. I'll be old, but will be worth the wait https://t.co/x6rvUIJJdL — Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) June 20, 2017

In 2018, Zaid threatened to deploy his connections in federal intelligence agencies to doxx a random Twitter user and complained about the account’s anonymity.

Hey ""Rex"", why don't you reveal your identity instead of attacking someone while hiding? I'd love to have my intelligence and law enforcement clients see what they can find about your life. We can compare notes on our research efforts. What do you say? Game? — Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) May 27, 2018

Zaid’s pursuit of clients to advance his own nefarious agenda is well-documented. In a 2018 podcast, Zaid said he often went out of his way to use the term “resistance” and bragged about having sued every president since 1993. On the same episode, Zaid said he fished for a client to serve as a plaintiff against Trump to keep the streak of lawsuits going.

It makes perfect sense, then, Zaid would represent Capitol police officers to testify in the politicized proceedings sponsored by Democrats with the recruitment of two Pelosi Republicans to offer a smokescreen of bipartisanship, when the committee is anything but.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/27/january-6-commission-show-trial-witnesses-repped-by-russian-collusion-ukraine-impeachment-kavanaugh-rape-hoaxers/,2021-07-27
Biden’s Weakness Will Result In Aggression. Here Are 4 Likely Scenarios,"Even prior to the stunning display of American failure in Afghanistan, President Biden appeared slow-witted and spineless on crucial U.S. national security matters.

For example, Biden handed Russia’s Vladimir Putin gift after gift: extending the START Treaty, lifting Nord Stream 2 pipeline sanctions despite bipartisan legislation and essentially surrendering Ukraine to Russia. During the Biden-Putin summit in Geneva, Biden was tougher with an American journalist than with Putin. After Biden’s advisers and the first lady told the press how extensively he prepared for the meeting, he cut it short.

Biden also responded to the several major cyberattacks traced to Russia—including the meat processor JBS and the Colonial pipeline—by handing Putin a list of critical infrastructure that was “off limits.” Biden claimed Putin would change his behavior if his standing was diminished in the world, showing a fundamental lack of understanding Putin’s motivations.

Rejoining the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran has been Biden’s top priority since taking office, and he was willing to offer Tehran almost anything for it. Tehran refused to negotiate with the United States directly, and operates with impunity in the Middle East.

In July, Iranian intelligence attempted to kidnap Masih Alinejad, an Iranian journalist, from American soil. In August, an Iranian drone attacked an Israeli merchant ship, killing two crew members. Iranian proxies targeted Americas in Syria and Iraq, and Hezbollah increased rocket attacks on Israel. It also appears Tehran attempted to close the Strait of Hormuz using sea mines.

In June, Biden proclaimed “America is back” with “renewed commitment to our allies and partners.” But North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies with troops on the ground in Afghanistan disagree as they scramble to get out their people out due to America’s hasty withdrawal. British paratroopers, prepared for face-to-face combat, have descended on Kabul to rescue British citizens.

Weakness invites aggression, so we should prepare for a tumultuous fall on the world stage. Here’s what to watch for.

1. An American Hostage Situation in Afghanistan

The Biden administration is not even aware of how many Americans are left in Afghanistan. It could be as many as 15,000. The administration canceled a Trump-era bureau overseeing protection and evacuation for American citizens in Afghanistan. Now Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says the U.S. military does not have the capability to “go in and collect large numbers of people.”

President Obama ensured the Taliban understood the value of American hostages. In 2014, Obama released five Taliban commanders—one of whom is currently among Taliban leadership in Kabul—for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who later pled guilty to desertion and was dishonorably discharged. The abandoned Americans may be used for leverage, either by the Taliban or other extremist groups. What is unfolding in Afghanistan may make the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis may look tame by comparison.

2. A Fresh Terror Attack on 9/11

Jihadists are relishing the idea that the United States weak and can be defeated. The anniversary of the 9/11 attacks has always posed heightened risk of terrorism. On September 11, 2012, jihadists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, killing Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. On August 13, DHS warned of a heightened risk from al-Qaeda, which released a new issue of its propaganda magazine Inspire for the first time in four years. The massive intelligence failure in Afghanistan does not inspire confidence in this administration’s ability to keep tabs on foreign terrorists.

The administration also appears utterly incapable of stopping foreign threats. The U.S. southern border is wide open. The president claims climate change is the greatest national security threat. Attorney General Merrick Garland says white supremacy is the greatest domestic threat.

The Justice Department has called the Capitol riot investigation one of the largest in American history, even as a Reuters report claims the FBI does not believe the riot was a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Still, those who did not engage in violence or destruction have been held in isolation for six months.

It is clear the Biden administration is distracted and incapable, making deterrence and prevention that much less likely.

3. A Possible Russian Offensive in Ukraine

As Center Senior Analyst Andrei Illarionov wrote in April, Putin was not ready for a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in the spring, but he would be ready by September. Putin may be able to extract concessions from Ukrainian President Zelensky that would negate need for an invasion.

If Putin decides to invade, however, it will likely be after the Zapad-2021 military exercises in mid-September. Military exercises can mask offensive operations, and Putin has used the tactic before.

4. Increased Chinese Pressure on Taiwan

Chinese state media taunted Taiwan after the fall of Kabul, claiming the United States would not come to Taiwan’s aid. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen responded by saying: “Taiwan’s only option is to grow stronger and become more united, strengthening our determination to protect ourselves.” On August 17, China held live-fire air and sea exercises near Taiwan, and sent 11 war planes into Taiwanese airspace.

In March, America’s top military officer in the Indo-Pacific told Congress China could invade Taiwan in the next six years. The Washington establishment is confident the idea of an imminent risk to Taiwan is overblown, but as Center for Security Policy analyst Grant Newsham pointed out in June, the Chinese military regularly increases capabilities faster and better than western analysts assume.

In the wake of Afghanistan, Newsham wrote, Beijing is likely to challenge the United States in multiple ways. This could include confronting U.S. forces in the South China Sea, establishing bases in Africa and South America, intensify the assault on the U.S. dollar, and intensifying nuclear weapons buildup, to name a few.

In the non-Western world, might makes right. Biden’s rhetoric and proclaimed compassion is meaningless, as bad actors pay attention to action. Biden’s incompetence has made the world a more dangerous place.

White House Blows Off Senate Inquiry Into Biden's Use Of Private Email,"The White House has so far dismissed a Senate inquiry into President Joe Biden’s use of private email while he was vice president.

In July, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin penned a letter to White House Counsel Dana Ann Remus, demanding information on what steps Biden and the administration took to ensure the then-vice president’s records satisfied archival requirements under federal law. According to the New York Post, Vice President Biden had been using private email addresses to correspond with his son Hunter, and on at least one occasion spoke of a meeting with the president of Ukraine where Hunter conducted overseas business.

“If these reports are accurate, it is unclear whether then-Vice President Biden forwarded these and related emails to a government account to ensure that they satisfied federal record-keeping and archival requirements,” the senators wrote. “Further, it is unclear whether now-President Biden has continued the use of non-government email for official business and whether he has continued to provide government information to his family members, including Hunter Biden.”

2021-07-30 CEG RHJ to White House Counsel (Biden Email) (1) by The Federalist on Scribd

The pair of lawmakers gave Remus an Aug. 13 deadline to respond, which has now lapsed by more than a month with no response, a Grassley spokesman confirmed to The Federalist on Tuesday.

While vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s “public face” of White House policy toward Ukraine as his son served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma raking in upwards of $83,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry.

The New York Post reported in July based on data retrieved from Hunter Biden’s laptop that Vice President Biden used several email addresses under pseudonyms “RobinWare456@gmail.com” and “Robert.L.Peters@pci.gov.” One email addressed to Joe Biden through the email named Robert Peters on May 26, 2016, and included Hunter read, “8:45am prep for 9am phone call with [Ukrainian] Pres. Poroshenko.”

Hunter Biden’s lucrative salary was later cut two months after his vice president father left office in 2017.

New York Times Invents Yet Another Story To Smear Trump Administration,"The New York Times’ double standard for coverage of leftists and conservatives, particularly former Trump administration officials, was on full display in several articles written by Charlie Savage over the past two months. In a recent story Savage and his Times colleagues wrote on the pending indictment of a prominent Democrat lawyer, Michael Sussman, who represented the Clinton campaign in 2016 and allegedly lied to the FBI, Savage could not have shown his ideological colors more if he tried.

Savage downplays Sussman’s conduct and undermines the legitimacy of the John Durham investigation. He even tries to paint Sussman as a victim by noting that, “Mr. Sussman and his firm have been particular targets for Mr. Trump and his supporters.” Savage also gives Sussman’s lawyer a significant amount of space to defend his client and put his spin on the matter.

However, when Savage is writing on a former Trump administration official, his default is to invent facts to smear the official and to violate major journalism ethics by not calling for comment before publishing. I am a former Trump official that he smeared and of course he never called for comment.

Savage wrote a July 29 article filled with a demonstrably false narrative about a lawsuit regarding a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted by the Times in 2019 to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding internal documents about Ukraine funding by the Department of Defense. I was OMB general counsel at the time.

What Happened In the Case

In the FOIA litigation, a career OMB lawyer filed a declaration in February 2020 explaining why the documents should not be disclosed because they included pre-decisional or presidential communications. Judge Amy Jackson ruled the government had not established an adequate justification to withhold the documents but allowed the Trump administration another attempt to justify the withholding.

Importantly, Judge Jackson issued an order on May 13 that all the documents be produced for her in camera (that is, private) inspection so she could make a determination regarding each document. The judge received them on May 20, 2020. I filed a declaration in the government’s next filing in September 2020, explaining my reasons why each document is legally protected from disclosure.

The judge accepted many of my arguments and allowed the government to withhold approximately half the documents at issue, but ordered others released. However, she commented on one of my representations, stating, “This was apparently written without the expectation that I would look at that document.”

Judge Jackson’s statement is false that I did not have an expectation that she would review the documents. Judge Jackson’s May 13 order specifically stated she would review the documents to make determinations, so I knew long before I filed my declaration in September that she would review every document.

Concocting a False Narrative

In recounting this story, Savage concocted a false narrative to smear me. He wrote, “Judge Jackson took the unusual step of demanding that the Justice Department privately show her the files rather than trusting a declaration from the Trump Administration about their contents. The description, by Mark Paoletta, then the general counsel for [OMB] . . .”

Savage then quotes the judge’s false statement about my expectation regarding her not reviewing the documents. He implies that I knowingly filed a false description of documents and expected that the judge would never request or review the underlying documents.

Savage had to know it was a career OMB attorney’s declaration—not mine—that the judge reviewed in early 2020, that her order to produce the documents had nothing to do with my declaration that did not exist at the time and was filed four months later. He also knew that the judge’s statement was wrong regarding my expectation that she would not review the documents, because she already had them.

I argued the documents at issue in this FOIA litigation could be withheld, as the law permits, because they were pre-decisional or involved presidential communications. The presidential communication privilege allows documents to be withheld if the president or a senior advisor asked for the information. Here, a senior advisor to the president for national security had asked to be kept apprised of developments on Ukraine funding issues and I treated it as a continuing request, so even an email originating from an OMB official on this topic would be considered responding to a request from that senior advisor.

These arguments are made regularly by every administration, and the FOIA statute allows for withholding these documents to not chill internal discussions that could harm government decision-making.

No ‘Smoking Gun’ Here

In fact, there was nothing new in any of these documents at issue from what had already been publicly released. The entire content of the email about which the judge made her comment was: “Rob, do you know if there has been or is any intent for discussion to drive a final decision on USIA [Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative] today?” That’s it.

This is no “smoking gun” document. The judge already had it in her possession. So why would I try to withhold this document, if I did not believe, as I did, that we were permitted to withhold it under FOIA? I was being consistent in the accepted standard for withholding documents despite the insignificance of that particular document.

There were, in fact, no “smoking guns” in any of the FOIA material at issue in this litigation. Because they failed so miserably in finding any damning evidence against the administration in this litigation, the Times had to invent a false “gotcha” story about me.

Pound the Table, Quick

Demonstrating that NY Times reporters are not the only partisan activists at the company, the Times deputy general counsel, David McCraw, went so far as to send a letter to the Department of Justice inspector general asking the IG to investigate the filing of several allegedly false declarations in FOIA cases, including mine. McCraw argued this alleged conduct is possible because judges don’t generally review the underlying documents at issue in most FOIA cases to check whether the declaration is accurately describing the documents.

But the judge already had the documents in my case, so McCraw’s entire premise for including my alleged false declaration is baseless. He only wants to smear me.

In the legal world, we call this kind of action “table pounding.” It is done to mislead a jury in a case where you have neither the law nor facts on your side.

McCraw also ridiculously claims that I tried to deceive the judge in my description of one document, despite the fact that the judge already had the documents. Far from engaging in deception, I told the judge exactly why I believed the documents could be withheld. The judge simply rejected my argument.

It’s not unusual for a judge to reject your legal argument or presentation of the facts. In fact, it happens in every case for the losing lawyer, something McCraw recently experienced in the NY Times’ crushing defeat in the Project Veritas defamation ruling. If a judge rejecting your argument and characterization of the facts in a case constitutes evidence that a lawyer made false statements, then the NY Times and McCraw’s legal team repeatedly made false statements to the court in the Project Veritas case. Also true to form, the Times’ reporters apparently did not call Project Veritas for comment before smearing them in its story.

Give Charlie Savage, David McCraw, and the disgraced New York Times points for consistency. They bend over backwards to protect Democrats but are always willing to make false statements and invent false narratives if it has anything to do with former Trump officials, even when those falsehoods are as transparent as their bias.

Financial Records Confirm Facebook 'Whistleblower' Is A Democrat Activist,"Frances Haugen, the so-called Facebook whistleblower who leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal lamenting that the Big Tech company wasn’t censoring enough content, is a confirmed left-wing activist and partisan operative, Federal Election Commission records show.

A simple search reveals that Haugen, who previously worked for other tech giants Google and Pinterest, has made more than 40 donations to Democrats totaling more than $2,000 since 2015. She has frequently contributed to ActBlue and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and in January 2020, she gave money to the congressional campaign of radical Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, plus another contribution to AOC’s “Courage to Change” political action committee, according to The Daily Wire. Below is just a sampling:

Although Haugen had money to throw at AOC’s campaign, that same month she had enough in unpaid taxes that a $44,000 federal tax lien was placed against her, The Daily Wire also reported, noting that the lien was released earlier this summer.

Now the so-called whistleblower’s lawyers, who are otherwise working pro bono, are trying to raise $100,000 through GoFundMe allegedly to pay for their legal expenses.

This brings up another partisan snag for Haugen, whose lawyers are Whistleblower Aid — a group co-founded by John Tye and Mark Zaid. If Zaid’s name sounds familiar, it’s because he was part of the legal team, led by Andrew Bakaj, that represented the fake “whistleblower” whose complaint about then-President Donald Trump’s Ukraine phone call (a call about which the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge) catapulted the administration into a sham impeachment.

The whole Ukraine “whistleblower” debacle was fraught with deceit, such as his secretly meeting with Democrat members of Congress before filing his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general — a fact that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff lied about. Corrupt media also worked with Democrats to conceal the identity of the so-called whistleblower, although RealClearInvestigations identified him as Eric Ciaramella, one of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden’s top Ukraine advisers.

This would have been a problem for Biden, of course, since the whole reason for Trump’s infamous phone call was to encourage Ukraine to investigate how when Biden was vice president, he had bribed Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating his scandal-ridden son Hunter Biden’s company — a bribe Joe Biden later bragged about.

Haugen’s 15 minutes as the Facebook “whistleblower” thus bears a resemblance to the Ukraine situation. She carefully leaked Facebook documents to the press while working with Zaid as well as Tye and Bakaj, who both used to work for prominent Democrats. Now she’s receiving “strategic communication guidance” from former Obama aide Bill Burton’s PR firm Bryson Gillette, which The Daily Wire described as “helmed by a raft of Democratic operatives.”

On Tuesday, Haugen testified before a Senate hearing at least in part to gain congressional support for more Big Tech censorship. She alleges that the company puts profits over safety by amplifying so-called misinformation — which she said is killing people, a talking point that’s also been parroted by the Biden White House.

“The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats, and more combat. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people,” testified Haugen, who has also been quoted making woke statements about “bias” and “inclusion” in her previous tech jobs. One science conference praised her for “specifically driving Pinterest’s recent change to give users the option to filter searches to specific skin tones.”

Haugen’s lawyers have filed eight complaints about Facebook with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s ineffectiveness at removing hate speech and lamenting that Facebook didn’t deploy “lasting counter-measures” or sufficiently fight so-called misinformation, right-wing extremism, and violence regarding the 2020 election and Jan. 6 riot.

The entire Facebook “whistleblower” ordeal comes amid widespread Big Tech censorship and dramatic partisan calls for crackdowns on what Democrats deem misinformation.

In July, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that due to a handful of unnamed people on social media posting what the Biden administration considered to be misinformation, the White House is actively “flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation” and “helping” to “boost trusted content.” She went on to say nothing is “off the table” for using Big Tech to quiet opposing views.

When a reporter asked Biden that same week what his message is to sites like Facebook, the president replied, “They’re killing people.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/06/financial-records-show-facebook-whistleblower-is-less-a-concerned-employee-and-more-a-radical-democrat-activist/,2021-10-06
CNN Spent A Year Running Interference For Hunter Biden And His Family,"CNN has now spent a year running political interference for Hunter Biden and the rest of the Biden family to take viewers’ attention away from a series of reports detailing their scandalous corruption that emerged in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

The New York Post, which initially reported its findings on Hunter’s laptop just weeks before the election, was targeted and censored by Big Tech companies. Despite the long list of corroborating evidence, reports, and even a full-fledged government investigation into Hunter’s sketchy business and money ties, corporate media chose to smear the story as fake news and even adopted the Democrat narrative that it was somehow “Russian disinformation.”

CNN, in particular, took great interest in not only amplifying Democrats’ lies that downplayed the sordid behavior captured by the Post’s reporting on the laptop, but even boosting Hunter and his dad as legitimate and trustworthy figures.

For a while, the outlet, like many others in the corrupt corporate media, refused to cover the Post’s findings that Hunter rose to the top of a Ukraine energy company while his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, served as the White House’s “public face” to the nation. When CNN finally got around to mentioning that the son of the Democrat presidential candidate may have used his dad’s ties to boost his own overseas business dealings and then offered a cut back to Joe, its anchors, reporters, and even media guests regurgitated the leftist narrative that Hunter and his now-president dad did nothing wrong.

“There’s no evidence that Hunter Biden has done anything wrong,” Jake Tapper repeated numerous times during CNN’s brief and biased coverage of the scandal. “There is no evidence that anybody did anything illegal regarding the Bidens and Ukraine, and Joe Biden was carrying out US policy,” he added in one segment.

Anderson Cooper, one of the outlet’s most recognizable media darlings, even interjected CNN’s scripted agenda on the Bidens during one of the Democratic presidential debates.

“President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there’s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you,” Cooper said.

Biden naturally agreed with Cooper and the leading, opinionated question.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,” Biden said. “I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.”

Now-First Lady Jill Biden also laughed off any reports of Hunter’s wrongdoing and told CNN viewers, “Hunter has done nothing wrong.”

SUPERCUT! CNN on Hunter Biden: Nothing to see here, move along! pic.twitter.com/4ZAJd2lBOt — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 14, 2021

During her coverage of Hunter, CNN anchor Brianna Keilar even went so far as to say, “Trump’s claims about wrongdoing here are unsubstantiated,” adding, “We have looked, lots of outlets have looked.”

Chris Cuomo — who used his position in the media to cover for his brother Andrew Cuomo during the then-New York governor’s sexual malfeasance and deadly COVID-19 nursing home policy scandals — also piled onto the pro-Biden narrative.

“PolitiFact found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son’s interests in mind,” Cuomo told his viewers.

CNN also stood idly by when Democrat Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz claimed that “what it confirms is that Hunter Biden is a person of integrity.”

Brian Stelter went so far as to praise Hunter and give his book a boost on air.

“I’ve never read a memoir like this one before,” he said. “This is Hunter Biden’s book ‘Beautiful Things.’ … It’s breathtaking.”

Turns Out Alexander Vindman Is The Dopey Hack We All Thought He Was,"Alexander Vindman, the retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who helped plot the botched impeachment of former President Donald Trump in what amounted to a failed coup attempt, thinks Tucker Carlson should be “censured” for saying things Vindman doesn’t like about the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

In a tweet Thursday responding to a trailer Carlson posted for his new documentary, “Patriot Purge,” Vindman asked, idiotically, “How is this different than yelling fire in a crowded theater? Carlson is attempting to incite a riotous mob. He should be censured. I’d like to hear the arguments for/against this being protected speech.”

Well since you asked, the argument for Carlson’s documentary being protected speech is right there in the Bill of Rights, on the first page, where it says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. That includes reporting and commentary that some people, even disgraced former Army officers who try to remove duly elected presidents, disagree with.

He is an anarchist; an arsonist of American democracy. How is this different than yelling fire in a crowded theater? Carlson is attempting to incite a riotous mob. He should be censured. I’d like to hear the arguments for/against this being protected speech. https://t.co/xHTaxXo2p2 — Alexander S. Vindman (@AVindman) October 28, 2021

It’s embarrassing for Vindman that this needs to be spelled out for him, but “protected speech” under the First Amendment includes pretty much everything except a handful of specific situations, none of which remotely have to do with Carlson’s documentary.

For example, you can’t call for imminent lawless action (or incitement). You also can’t issue what’s called a “true threat,” which the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 defined as “those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.” Fighting words is another, quite limited category of unprotected speech that’s restricted to face-to-face interactions meant to provoke a violent reaction from the person being addressed. Not covered in any of these categories is, say, political reporting and commentary that Vindman doesn’t like.

Vindman, the man who broke the chain of command and illegally leaked the contents of a phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to a “whistleblower” in order to jump-start the Ukraine impeachment circus, is also confused about what “yelling fire in a crowded theater” means. People like Vindman always invoke the fire-in-a-crowded-theater line every time they want to justify censorship, and every time they reveal their bone-crushing ignorance.

The line comes from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who in a 1919 opinion in Schenck v. United States wrote, “The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.” But Schenck was one of the most loathsome free speech decisions in the court’s history, and it was overturned 50 years ago.

In Schenck, the Supreme Court was tasked with deciding whether Charles Schenck, the secretary of the Socialist Party of America, could be convicted under the Espionage Act for distributing a pamphlet that opposed the draft during World War I. The pamphlet didn’t call for violence or even civil disobedience, but merely urged Americans to petition for a repeal of the draft and to “assert your rights.”

Holmes’ crowded theater line was simply his way of saying the First Amendment isn’t absolute. But it had no legal authority and wasn’t part of the actual ruling, which was that Schenck’s pamphlet posed a “clear and present danger” to the country. This absurd ruling was one of a trio of odious free speech decisions the Supreme Court issued in 1919 that landed peaceful anti-war protesters in prison.

But Schenck was overturned in the landmark 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio, which held that inflammatory speech, even speech that advocates violence — even, say, if the speaker is at a Ku Klux Klan rally where klansmen are burning crosses and carrying firearms — is protected by the First Amendment unless it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”

In other words, the First Amendment is expansive, and by trotting out the crowded theater line about a political documentary he doesn’t like, Vindman is putting himself on the side of the worst censorship decision ever handed down by the Supreme Court, a decision that has since been discredited, disgraced, and thrown into the dustbin of history.

But then Vindman should be well familiar with that.

Tucker Carlson Rails Against Push For War With Russia Over Ukraine,"Fox News’ Tucker Carlson railed against the push to war with Russia over Ukraine Tuesday night as the two nations locked in a territorial stalemate prep for a Kremlin invasion as early as next year.

“The only question that matters is, ‘How does intervening in Ukraine help the core interests of the United States?'” Carlson asked. “Of course, that is the one question no one in Washington is asking.”

#Thread Tucker Carlson's Monologue Calling Out The Biden Administration & The Bipartisan Push By Neo-Cons For A War With Russia Over Ukraine “The only question that matters is how does intervening in Ukraine help the core interests of the United States?"" pic.twitter.com/G5COCpXyPZ — The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle) December 8, 2021

At the core of the conflict is Ukraine’s desire to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a post-World War II alliance formed to counter Soviet aggression. Ukraine’s recruitment threatens Russian interests in eastern Europe and jeopardizes access to a major naval base in the Black Sea, while strengthening an alliance adversarial to the Kremlin.

“For Vladimir Putin, that’s unacceptable. It’s a disaster, he cannot let it happen, he will not let it happen,” Carlson said. “But for the United States, and this is the main point here, there is no benefit either. The United States would gain precisely nothing for taking over Ukraine. Why would we want to do that?”

Carlson explained an overly aggressive response from the White House would drive Russia “deeper into the arms of China.”

In the president’s call with Putin on Tuesday, Biden reportedly committed to severe economic consequences complemented by enhanced military support for Ukraine if Russia followed through on its invasion. The United States has also threatened to send U.S. troops to the region.

“If there’s one thing the Biden White House cares about, it’s secure borders, at least in Eastern Europe, where borders are not racist,” Carlson said. “It would be immoral to open those borders to the world and allow say, tens of thousands of unemployed Haitians to pour across. We can’t allow that, and in fact we will send American troops to Ukraine to prevent that. Open borders are only permitted in Texas, Arizona, and California and anywhere else Democratic voters might arrive.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/08/tucker-carlson-rails-against-neocon-push-for-war-with-russia-over-ukraine/,2021-12-08
"After Huge Debacles, Interventionists Agitate For War In Ukraine, Taiwan","If you thought for one moment that the embarrassing multi-decade debacle in Afghanistan would lead to some soul-searching from the failed interventionists responsible for America’s 21st-century Vietnam, think again. Instead of taking a step back to understand exactly why and how their grandiose plans to use the mightiest military in history to impose a top-down, secular, Western-style democracy didn’t quite pan out, they’re doubling down on failure.

When you’re a hammer, everything is a nail, and when you’re a global interventionist, wars fix everything. This time, their target is Ukraine. And Taiwan. Because why start a war with Russia when you can start a war with Russia and a war with China?

According to the same foreign policy blob that brought us such hits as “Saddam Hussein is going to nuke us with all his WMDs” and “Donald Trump is totally getting blackmailed by Vladimir Putin over a magical sex tape,” America needs to prepare for war with Russia because Russia is allegedly massing troops on…its own border with Ukraine.

America’s porous border with Mexico, across which hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants have been flooding unimpeded since the day President Joe Biden took office, is apparently no big deal at all and not remotely worthy of an American military presence. But Ukraine’s border with Russia? To the failed foreign policy blob, that is priority numero uno.

The Russia-Ukraine border must be defended, with American blood and treasure, at all costs. And if you suggest that maybe America should fix America’s border first, it’s because you’re racist or something.

pic.twitter.com/L8QvmtjAez — The Right To Bear Memes (@grandoldmemes) December 8, 2021

Now don’t you dare ask proponents of a new war with Russia over Ukraine to detail exactly why Americans need to die to litigate a border dispute between Ukraine and Russia.

Don’t ask them why it’s our responsibility and not that of Ukraine and greater Europe.

Don’t you dare ask them to explain how the same government whose politicians lost a war against Stone Age goatherders — and then thought it was a good idea to abandon thousands of Americans and billions of dollars in American military equipment in Afghanistan — can possibly be trusted to wage any war right now, let alone one with a nuclear superpower.

Don’t ask them why Ukrainian border security is a bigger national security priority than American border security.

When you press for answers to those questions, you hear, “Russia bad. Putin mean. Something something Ukraine democracy.” If you demand specifics, they demand war — and not just in Europe. “Oh,” they retort, “you don’t want to fight for Ukraine? Well, you probably want to hand over Taiwan to China, too.”

In the process of agitating for war against Russia in Ukraine, they’ve demanded another war against China. Amazing how that works.

“There can be no room for misunderstanding. An attack against Ukraine would be as devastating to the European order as an attack on Taiwan would be to the Asian order.” @PostOpinions https://t.co/v5L33hyQuK — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) December 6, 2021

Ready for some real talk? Taiwan is a shiny object used by elites who have deliberately outsourced America’s economy to China to look tough on an issue where they couldn’t care less about America’s interests.

Do you want to hand over America’s capacity to make things while posturing as though you’re big and tough and super dialed-in on sticking it to the Chinese communists? Taiwan is perfect. You can beat your chest and saber rattle with one hand about Taiwan’s independence, while signing deals with the other hand to hollow out our manufacturing base so China can have even more money to build its army and navy.

Make no mistake: The Chinese Communist Party is evil. It cannot be allowed to grow bigger and stronger. Its vile social credit system –which is rapidly being imported to the West under the guise of digital passports that grant access to food or health care — cannot be allowed to infect American life.

While going to war in Ukraine or Taiwan might assuage the egos of interventionists who enjoy patting themselves on the back for having the courage to send better men to die for a war they’d never volunteer to fight in, and while it might pad the income statements of defense contractors reeling from having their gravy trains in Iraq and Afghanistan shut down, it wouldn’t do much at all to slow the gears of the economic engine that is the true source of China’s power.

China has been fighting a cold war against America for decades, and it has funded its newfound military might by capturing large swaths of the American economy. When America’s ruling elites decided a cheap TV manufactured overseas was more important than a domestic manufacturing base that formed the foundation of the American middle class for generations, they handed China a massive weapon to use against America and its allies across the world.

There is no Red China superpower without hundreds of thousands of red, white, and blue jobs and trillions of dollars being shipped overseas by a corporate and political establishment that sees itself more as a global profiteer than a protector of American interests. The lesson of the Cold War with the Soviet Union wasn’t that we should have had more Vietnam-esque wars over territory that meant nothing to America’s global interests, it’s that you cannot win a cold war without winning the economic war that funds it.

The Soviet Union didn’t collapse because of America’s military might: It crumbled because of America’s economic might combined with the weakness of a communist system that rotted from within.

China certainly learned from that example. Instead of railing against American-style capitalism, China co-opted it. It decided to use the strength of our capitalist economy against us by gobbling up our trade and using the money to build its military.

And what did the American political establishment do via its trade, economic, and monetary policies? It fed the Red China beast at every single opportunity. It is still doing so at this very minute.

Having successfully crippled the manufacturing capacity that made America the envy of the world, the corrupt establishment is now trying to destroy America’s energy industry by forcing everyone to stop using oil and gas — cheap, plentiful, efficient sources of energy — in favor of electric cars and gadgets that rely on rare earth minerals over which China is quickly building a global mining and production monopoly.

Economically, China is playing for keeps, and our leaders are asleep at the wheel. While China colonizes Africa to take over its rare earth mineral mines to increase its leverage over the global energy economy, our ruling elites hyperventilate over Ukraine and Taiwan.

If you want to win a war with China, you have to be serious about destroying the engine that powers the Asian nuclear superpower — and it’s clear that America’s ruling elite has zero interest in waging the kind of economic war necessary to neuter the country. We know the establishment is not serious about fighting that war and hitting China where it really hurts because the establishment fights those measures at every turn.

The issue of Taiwan isn’t raised because the foreign policy Borg deeply cares about Taiwan’s right to independence and self-determination — it’s raised because the foreign policy Borg wants a fig leaf to cover up its desire to milk China’s economic cash cow, America’s long-term economic and national security interests be damned.

Does Taiwan deserve freedom and independence from the crushing evil of China’s corrupt communist regime? Of course it does (as do all countries and people). That’s why its people fought so hard for independence.

The question for American policymakers is not whether Taiwan should be free. The question is whether it serves America’s long-term national security interests to engage in a war with Russia over Ukraine, and then another war with China over Taiwan.

Does this mean appeasement is required? Of course not. America has an array of non-military diplomatic and economic tools it can use to incentivize countries like Russia and China to not do the wrong thing. In the case of Russia, America could push to block the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major vehicle for Russian influence and power in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This was the tack taken by the Trump administration, only to be reversed by the Biden administration earlier this year.

But America has no obligation to deploy troops to every corner of the globe or wage war in any country where oppression exists or bad people rule. America’s obligation is to its own people and its own security. America’s interests come first, always.

That is where the real disagreement lies. Taiwan and Ukraine are proxy debates over the soul of American policy and the priorities of its government. Does our government exist to protect and serve us — whether it’s on our own border or our own factory floors — or does it exist to first protect the priorities of everyone else?

"Right Responds To Cancel Culture By Building Its Own, Left Goes Nuts","Last week the corrupt media’s penchant for spinning all things conservative caused a near-fatal case of whiplash.

The left began by chastising conservatives for supposedly building “its own echo chamber,” but by the next day, when news broke that Devin Nunes was resigning from Congress to serve as the CEO of Donald Trump’s new media company, the complained-of conservative ecosystem merely represented grift. Both narratives are false, however, which is precisely why leftists peddled them so hard.

Axios launched the “echo chamber” accusation with its article titled, “Right wing builds its own echo chamber.” “Conservatives are aggressively building their own apps, phones, cryptocurrencies and publishing houses in an attempt to circumvent what they see as an increasingly liberal internet and media ecosystem,” the Axios article began.

The article then highlighted plans for the YouTube alternative Rumble and Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, to expand their reach by taking the companies public. Also highlighted was the social app Gettr that former-Trump aide Jason Miller launched, as well as conservative efforts to compete in cryptocurrency, phones, cloud storage, and book publishing.

“The bottom line,” Axios closed, was that, “Conservative media has been a powerhouse for a long time, but this phase of its expansion isn’t just about more or louder conservative voices — it’s about building an entire conservative ecosystem.”

The refusal by conservatives to continue “to consume” the product of the increasingly “deranged and unaccountable lefty media” is not about building an echo chamber, however: It is about competition and choice. And branding these new business ventures an “ecosystem” and “echo chamber” merely reveal the left’s panic over their inability to control the narrative.

The corrupt media quickly put a brake on the echo-chamber attack when the day after Axios bemoaned the loosening of the left’s stranglehold over corporate America came news that Nunes would retire in January to serve as the new CEO of Trump’s Truth Social company. No longer was the story about an “ecosystem,” it was now about “grift.”

“How Devin Nunes’s new media job for Trump explains the GOP grift machine,” the Washington Post headlined an op-ed by columnist Paul Waldman. Waldman supported his thesis by pointing out that “with Republicans poised to win the House, Nunes was in line to become the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation’s tax laws.”

“There was a time when the Ways and Means chair was considered second only to House Speaker in prestige and power,” the Post opinion piece continued. Leaving behind that likelihood, Waldman reasoned, showed Nunes’s supposed desire to “get in on the grift.”

Leave it to a liberal to think grift is foregoing the second most powerful position in the U.S. House of Representatives to accept a position in the private sector in a fledgling organization.

In reporting on Nunes’s announcement, The New York Times’s Jonathan Weisman likewise focused on the fact that if the California representative continued his congressional career, he would “assume the help of the powerful Ways and Means Committee if Republicans took control of the House, as they are favored to do.” This move, Weisman declared, represented a signal by Nunes to “where he thinks power lies in the Republican Party and the conservative movement.”

Nunes’s decision to leave Congress to become Truth Social’s CEO does represent a signal—just not the one Weisman claims. To see the reason behind the move, the Times’ congressional correspondent need only have re-read his article, where a handful of paragraphs later, Weisman wrote:

From his perch on the Intelligence Committee, he ran interference for Mr. Trump against accusations that his 2016 campaign had collaborated with Russian intelligence. Mr. Nunes also organized a united Republican front opposing the first impeachment of the president for withholding military assistance to Ukraine to pressure its government to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden.

That a longtime congressional correspondent could pen those lines and The New York Times could unironically publish them shows exactly why Nunes left Congress to lead Truth Social.

Having lived through the heyday of the Russia-collusion hoax, as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Nunes fought to expose the truth of the Crossfire Hurricane disaster to the American public. Yet the corporate press fed the lies of the Democrat ranking member to the country instead. The California Republican saw a repeat of this ploy with the Ukraine impeachment proceedings. Hatred for Trump proved the breaking straw to the already biased establishment press.

Then came the censorship, limiting conservatives’ ability to counter the corrupt media. Again, Nunes experienced that firsthand, being shadow-banned by Twitter in 2018.

And if any more proof were needed of corporate cronies’ ability to control information, the burying of the Hunter Biden laptop story that implicated then-candidate Joe Biden in a pay-to-play scandal right before the 2020 election handed Nunes—and our country—the final piece of evidence.

So Nunes had a choice: Stay in Congress and chair the House’s most powerful committee as a Republican, limited by the Democrat-controlled executive branch, or surrender the cozy conclave and create an enterprise to counter the slant and censorship that over the last five years has grown exponentially. The left might not understand Nunes’s decision, but here’s hoping it learns his reason soon—and the hard way.

What If Trump Had Greenlighted Russia To Invade Ukraine Like Biden Did?,"President Biden was actually operating from a coherent perspective in discussing Russia and Ukraine in Wednesday’s press conference: In every instance, as you go line-for-line in the transcript, his foreign policy—and the fact that he announced it to the world—is one where Russia has leverage over Biden and the president has a personal vendetta against the current Ukrainian government.

When asked whether sanctions would deter Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine, our commander in chief replied that Russia “will be held accountable if it invades,” but then clarified: “It depends on what it does. It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.” Biden then juxtaposed a “minor incursion,” which would lead to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) fight over how to respond, with Russia doing “what they’re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border.”

In that case, Biden assured the audience—which surely included Putin and his top military leaders—“our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.” Biden then proceeded to ramble aloud his internal thoughts on Putin’s thinking before adding, in reference to Ukraine, “My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.”

After the press conference, Biden’s team attempted to walk back his “minor incursion” comment, but it was much too late for that. Putin already noted the greenlight that Biden flashed, not just once, but twice.

The second surrender came when a reporter offered the president a chance to correct himself live, asking, “Are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?” Biden laughed, saying, “That’s how it did sound like, didn’t it?”

Significantly, though, Biden did not disavow that understanding, but instead said “the most important thing . . .big nations can’t bluff, number one.” So, to Biden telling Putin we would respond to any invasion, even a minor incursion, would be nothing but a bluff.

Here’s Some Free Intel, Russia

Biden then did the unthinkable—unless you’re in Putin’s pocket, that is: He told our Russian adversary that NATO is split on how to respond to anything “short of a significant invasion.” “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do depending on what happens — the degree to which they’re able to go,” Biden explained.

Don’t worry, though, Biden seemed to say, because Putin wants some things that we are more than willing to give him. The president then told the world and Russia precisely what we were willing to commit to: no strategic weapons in Ukraine and no NATO membership for Ukraine in the near term.

Biden also made sure to let Putin know what we knew, or suspected, such as that a move from the north, from Belarus, would require Russia “to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross.” The president also told his Russian counterpart that we knew they had “people in Ukraine now trying to undermine the solidarity within Ukraine about Russia and to try to promote Russian interest,” making it very important to keep “everyone in NATO on the same page.”

More Presents for Putin

Wednesday’s bowing to Russia, unfortunately was not Biden’s first capitulation.

The Business Insider detailed Biden’s first present to Putin in an article, the title of which presents perfectly the irony laid out below: “Trump was slammed for cozying up to Putin, but Biden handed him a greater gift by waiving sanctions on a gas pipeline that could destabilize Europe.”

That article detailed Biden’s backtracking on the sanctions Trump had imposed against Russia concerning the Nord Stream pipeline that connected Russia to Germany. Congress would later also impose sanctions on the CEO of the company constructing the pipeline, an ally of Putin according to the Business Insider.

While “Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised in March to keep looking for ways to stop” the pipeline, by July the Biden administration agreed to allow the project to go forward, even though Democratic colleagues of the president had also “long opposed the project,” according to the article. Here, the opposition stemmed not merely because “it hands Russia an economic advantage over its European neighbors but because it could cause the US significant foreign-policy problems in the future. Chief among those problems are fears that Nord Stream 2 could liberate Russia to invade Ukraine – a US and EU ally – where Putin annexed Crimea in 2014.”

Because “Russia imports gas through Ukraine,” the article explained, Putin would be hesitant to interfere with its supply route. But with the Nord Stream 2 bypassing Ukraine, “Russia may no longer feel bound by the same caution.”

What On Earth Was Biden Thinking?

After Wednesday’s press conference, the Kremlin likely sees little risk to invading its western neighbor, at least the portions populated by ethnic Russians.

What could possibly possess our commander in chief, the leader of the most powerful country in the free world, to treat Russia and Ukraine as two vying contests on a reality-TV show, with Biden publicly declaring his love for Russia and sending Ukraine packing? And what could possibly cause Biden to change course and reverse the one sanction that seems to stalemate the standoff between Putin and Ukraine?

For four years, Democrats and the leftist press saw an easy answer to President Trump’s every comment related to Russia and Ukraine: kompromat and corruption.

The claim that Russia had leverage over Trump gained traction before his inauguration when a leak to CNN led the network to publish news of what is now known as the Steele dossier. Later published by BuzzFeed, the discredited work of fiction that relied on false “intel” fed to Steele by Russian national Igor Danchenko and that was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign claimed the Russian government had “kompromat,” or “compromising information,” on Trump.

Russian Collusion Used to Be a Huge Narrative

For years, the anti-Trump contingent used the Steele dossier and its claim that Russia held leverage over the president to fan the flames of a Trump-Russia conspiracy. But the Russia-leverage narrative extended beyond the discredited dossier and continued throughout Trump’s term.

For instance, in a May 2019 article titled, “Donald Trump’s Foreign Policy ‘Is One Where Russia Has Leverage Over Him,’ Former CIA Official Says,” Newsweek discussed a former CIA and defense official’s appearance on MSNBC. Appearing on the cable network’s “Morning Joe,” Jeremy Bash “argued that Trump’s international policies appear to be impacted by Russian ‘leverage over him’” the Newsweek article explained.

“I would say that the president actually is operating from a coherent perspective, in that he totally pushes away intelligence, he doesn’t listen to it, every instance as you go down the line, his foreign policy is one where Russia has leverage over him,” Bash told the MSNBC audience.

Bash, a former CIA official, then identified what he claimed was a series of foreign policy decisions favorable to Russia, including what Bash called Trump’s “decision to denigrate NATO.” Bash also highlighted Trump’s comments about Russia rejoining the G-7 and his supposed “decision to endorse election interference by [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,” to support the case that Putin had Trump in his back pocket.

The Atlantic pushed this same narrative, in its article entitled, “Donald Trump Gave Russia Leverage Over His Presidency.” There, the liberal outlet argued Trump lied when shortly after his inauguration he said, “Russia is a ruse,” and that he had “nothing to do with Russia.”

With these denials, Trump handed Russian intelligence “the ability to unmask Trump as a liar to the American public,” the Atlantic argued, relying on BuzzFeed’s account of the negotiations involving a potential Trump Tower in Moscow. Likewise, “the prospect that the Russians have been in possession of evidence suggesting that the president’s son may have committed a felony,” gave Russia leverage over Trump, according to the article.

Blackmail Is a Powerful International Tool

Susan Hennessey, now a member of the Biden administration’s Department of Justice National Security Division, likewise peddled this theory on a Lawfare podcast, suggesting “the United States is in an incredibly dangerous position where the American president is aware that a hostile foreign adversary potentially has devastating—politically devastating and potentially legally and criminally devastating, if not for him, then for members of his family or organization.”

“Those really are the kinds of conditions where your worst nightmare is about blackmail and influence,” Hennessey added in her discussion of the Kremlin and what it might know about Trump.

While kompromat explained Trump’s handling of Russia, according to his critics, Democrats and their partners in the press claimed corruption governed his interactions with Ukraine. Here, according to the left, Trump used his position as president of the United States to demand the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, launch a supposedly sham investigation into 2016 election interference and the Biden family.

The closely coordinated effort between the anti-Trump deep state, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and the press led to the House impeaching Trump for supposedly “subvert[ing] U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermin[ing] our national security,” to damage his political foe, Joe Biden.

Apply the Trump Narrative to Biden

Using the same lens as the left’s, then, what can possibly explain Joe Biden’s performance Wednesday afternoon? Why would he subvert U.S. foreign policy toward both Ukraine and Russia and America’s relationship with its NATO allies?

It is inexplicable? Or is it? Might Russia have leverage against Joe Biden?

Hunter Biden thought they did, according to a video of the president’s son published by The Daily Mail in August of 2021. The “unearthed footage,” The Daily Mail reported, captured a naked Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that ‘the Russians have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex!’”

As I reported at the time: “The video then captured Hunter telling the prostitute that during the summer of 2018 he had nearly overdosed from drugs while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. When he came to later, ‘there was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,’ Hunter explained. He then discovered his laptop was missing.

‘I think he’s the one that stole my computer,’ Hunter said on the tape, apparently referring to his drug dealer. ‘I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,’ Hunter explained. ‘They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex f-cking, you know,’ Hunter added. ‘My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,’ Hunter continued, ‘and somebody stole it during that period of time.’”

At this point, the prostitute asked Hunter if he feared the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him.

“Yeah, in some way yeah,” Hunter responded, adding that his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

The risk of blackmail to the president, however, extends much beyond a sex scandal involving Hunter and includes potential text and email messages stored on the stolen laptop that implicate “the Big Guy” in a pay-to-play scandal.

The Dossier Doesn’t Stop There

Not only could this kompromat make Biden beholden to Russia to the disadvantage of Ukraine, the recent charges prosecutors for Ukraine’s Zelenskyy filed against Biden’s pal, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, for treason and supporting terrorism offer a personal motive to explain the president’s actions—at least one as plausible as the one pushed by Democrats against Trump.

Poroshenko served as president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, during the time Biden held the office of vice president and then following Trump’s election. In 2014, when then-Vice President Biden was charged with working with Ukraine, his son Hunter became a board member of a Kyiv-based gas company named Burisma. Even though Hunter lacked any experience in the gas sector, he received compensation reportedly upward of $50,000 a month for his services.

The Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee would later release a damning report “detailing a wide array of Hunter Biden’s conflicts of interest, including potentially criminal overseas business activity while his father Joe Biden served as vice president.”

The Senate report also alleged that the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, “paid a $7 million bribe to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office to close an investigation seven months following Hunter Biden’s addition to its leadership.” Prior to the 2020 election, Trump had claimed that Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor who had targeted Burisma, but Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied the accusation.

A leaked telephone call that occurred between then-Vice President Biden and Poroshenko shortly after Trump’s election also tells the story of a bond between the two men. Biden began his conversation informally, “Hey, Petro. It’s Joe. How are you?”

“Very well indeed, as usual, when I hear your voice, my dear friend,” the then-Ukraine president responded.

Biden then proceeded to tell Poroshenko that Trump’s election had surprised everyone and “the incoming administration doesn’t know a great deal about the situation.” He added, as The New York Post put it, that “he had withheld some information regarding Ukraine from his counterparts in the Trump transition team.”

As the call neared an end, Biden noted that after he left the White House, “as a private citizen, I plan on staying deeply engaged in the endeavor that you have begun and we have begun.”

However, Poroshenko would soon also find himself out of office, when in April 2019 Zelenskyy defeated him in the nation’s election.

Thereafter, Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate the alleged bribery related to Burisma and any connection to the Biden family. For that Trump was impeached, without the House ever investigating the alleged Burisma corruption underlying the request. Democrats and the press instead sold Trump’s request as purely politically motivated.

Surely, then, they see Biden’s very public sacrifice of Ukraine in the same light: as personal payback for President Zelenskyy’s willingness to do Trump’s bidding, for delving into the Biden dynasty’s affairs, and for targeting his former counterpart, former President Poroshenko. And, surely, they see kompromat behind Biden’s figurative directing of Putin’s troops across the Ukrainian border.

Of course not. Republicans should not see it that way either, because when Joe Biden is involved, nothing should be ascribed to corruption that can be plainly explained by his incompetence.

"Failing At Home, Biden Distracts Voters With Another Conflict Overseas","President Joe Biden’s domestic strategy is failing so he’s trying to distract Americans with yet another inevitable deadly conflict overseas.

Less than one year after he sacrificed at least 13 American lives and stranded thousands more to score political points by haphazardly withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Biden is seriously considering sending more American service members to die on foreign soil.

On Monday, the president signaled that, after deliberations at Camp David over the weekend, he may send between 1,000 to 5,000 U.S. reinforcement troops to NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics to potentially deter Russia from invading Ukraine.

The Biden administration hasn’t directly stated that it will force American troops into combat in Ukraine itself, but the U.S. has already ramped up weapons shipments to Ukraine, the same county where the president’s scandal-ridden son, Hunter Biden, built his fortune. The State Department has also already ordered members of the U.S. embassy in Kyiv to leave Ukraine, signaling that the Biden administration sees Russia’s threats as imminent.

Instead of addressing the unchecked inflation, bare grocery shelves, ongoing pandemic, rising urban crime, and the U.S.’s own border troubles which regularly plague American families, the ever-unpopular Biden is using Russia’s conflict with Ukraine to pretend that his administration is doing something other than creating crises.

A myriad of new polls released this week shows that a majority, 56 percent, of Americans disapprove of the president’s job. So unhappy, in fact, that only 26 percent of Americans believe things in the country are going well.

Biden’s efforts to gracefully pass his Build Back Bankrupt plan and nuke the filibuster didn’t win the hearts and minds of voters as he wanted, so Biden is shifting his efforts abroad. It’s a “wag the dog” strategy that other world leaders have tried and ultimately failed to execute successfully.

History is littered with empires that decided to start dumb wars to distract from social/economic problems in their own backyards. The worse Biden’s numbers get, the more likely it becomes that he’ll send your kids to the meat grinder in the hopes a war will juice his numbers. https://t.co/wEAYGxq0so — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) January 24, 2022

As early as the 1800s, those in power used their authority to start conflicts with foreign powers to manipulate public opinion. French Emperor Louis Napoleon was suspected of pandering to French Catholics and trying to boost his country’s crumbling reputation when he entered the Crimean War in 1854. Napoleon, experts say, wanted to lord France’s power over Russian Orthodox Christians to keep Frenchmen’s minds off of problems at home.

A more recent example of this distraction came in 1998 when President Bill Clinton suddenly decided, just days after he confessed to having sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, to bomb potential terrorists in Afghanistan and Sudan.

Some leftists in the corporate media even tried to accuse Trump of possibly gearing up foreign distractions to take off pressure at home.

While his own border is suffering, taking a toll on his and his VP’s popularity, Biden wants to ship Americans into a frozen wasteland thousands of miles away to possibly engage Russia and defend a country that is near and dear to his heart and his family’s pocketbooks. The homeland is suffering so Biden wants a distraction to prevent his reputation from falling further than it already has.

U.S. Hawks Are Pushing China And Russia Into A Dangerous Alliance,"Image Credit Christopher Michel/ Flickr

China, Russia, and Iran have held a joint naval exercise in the Persian Gulf. This occurred the same week as Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s visit to Moscow. A burgeoning coalition like this should raise concerns in Washington about the unintended consequences of America’s foreign policy.

Russia and China are increasingly cooperating militarily and collaborating on technology including aviation and weapons. In summer 2021, the two countries held military drills in China, then naval drills in the fall. Adding Iran to these naval drills is relatively new, only having first occurred in 2019.

Despite all three countries being the target of American hawks, they have large diverging interests and might naturally mistrust each other. Iran is historically an ally of Moscow, yet China and Russia are not natural allies. The two countries share a massive border, while Russia has resources coveted by China’s far larger population and economy. The distrust between the two countries, just given geography, is so strong that China and Russia almost fell into open war in 1969.

The inarguable reason for increasing Russian and Chinese military cooperation is hawkish and interventionist foreign policy in Washington, pursued on a bipartisan basis and pushed by many entrenched elements in the American foreign policy and intelligence bureaucracy.

To be sure, it makes sense to view China as a competitor. China is the world’s number-two economy, just behind America, and Beijing seeks hegemony in Asia and in the South China Sea — areas where America still has a strong presence and influence. On top of this, some hawkish U.S. politicians appear to want to use Americans’ widespread negative views on the loss of industry and jobs to China as a means toward building up military resources around China.

Russia Driven toward China

Yet Russia being driven toward China is less easily explained by simple geopolitics, and largely centers on foreign policy choices made in both Washington and Moscow. Russia’s economy is relatively small — smaller than Italy’s — and incredibly dependent on selling hydrocarbons to Europe and Asia. Russia’s military spending is larger, relative to its population and economy, at about $60 billion per year. But that’s less than a tenth of what America spends, at more than $750 billion per year.

But Russian territorial expansion in Eastern Europe — in addition to claims of Russian influence in American politics — has caused U.S.-Russia relations to massively sour. The Trump administration hugely increased sanctions on Moscow, built up U.S. military forces in Eastern Europe, withdrew from an arms treaty, added two new countries to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an organization formed to confront Moscow militarily, and worked to block the export of Russian natural gas to Europe.

While the Biden administration has marginally taken a softer tone toward Russia, Russia’s military buildup has pundits from Bill Kristol to Obama administration official Ben Rhodes calling for a strong American response, including adding Ukraine to NATO. In fact, some of the rhetoric is apocalyptic. Rhodes wrote that “we are potentially on the verge of a land war in Europe aimed at extinguishing democracy.”

Russian Motivations

Russia’s motivations seem simpler. Just as Russia’s belligerent Crimea invasion in 2014 was motivated by wanting to secure its naval base in Sevastopol and create a buffer between itself and migrant crises in the Middle East, so too does its attempted annexation of Eastern Ukraine revolve around the deep Russian interest in creating a buffer between itself and Europe — although there are also ethnic-based motivations toward controlling an area where a large Russian-speaking population exists.

In the same vein, Russia views NATO expansion as a direct threat. NATO expansion objectively increases the odds that an Eastern European territorial dispute sucks nuclear-armed America and Russia into open war. None of this excuses Russia’s actions, but understanding Moscow’s motivations is necessary to assess the overall threat and contradict the over-the-top rhetoric coming from U.S. military hawks.

Stated bluntly, America is facing a larger combined threat of Russia and China because American military hawks are inflating the threat posed by each. Fortunately, the Biden administration has yet to fall sway to the bipartisan pro-war caucus. But Russia’s potential Ukraine aggression threatens this. The West is funneling weapons into Ukraine, which is at best a struggling democracy but at worst incredibly corrupt and dysfunctional.

The most immediate action that can push back against a burgeoning anti-U.S. coalition of Russia and China lies in recognizing Russian motivations and seeking pragmatic diplomatic solutions to the Russia-Ukraine crisis as well as other territorial concerns. War is not in the interest of either America or Russia, and a sane foreign policy will work toward a solution that avoids war between the world’s two preeminent nuclear-armed powers.

Longer-term, America must move away from viewing adversaries and competitors with one-size-fits-all moralizing. China and Russia are widely divergent on core interests, but the U.S. approach is inadvertently incentivizing these powers to deepen cooperation. The degree of Sino-Russian cooperation — especially on military issues — is dependent on America’s willingness to use careful diplomacy and restraint before we opt for economic sanctions and military support or action.

"In Dinging War With Russia, Tucker Carlson Puts American Interests First","A recent Tucker Carlson monologue questioned the relentless narrative insisting Americans must compulsively side with Ukraine against Russia in their conflict.

“We are potentially on the verge of a land war in Europe aimed at extinguishing democracy and sovereignty, and the American right wing is on the side of ethno-nationalist authoritarianism. That’s where we’re at,” tweeted President Obama’s former speechwriter Ben Rhodes, who coined the phrase “DC blob,” in reply to Carlson without a hint of irony.

Another Democrat operative, who allegedly worked with the Ukrainian embassy to dig up dirt on President Trump, tweeted that Carlson should be prosecuted as a foreign agent. To top it all, President Obama’s former Russia hand quite literally called for war against a nuclear rival to ensure the sovereignty of Ukraine, a proposition unthinkable during Cold War bipartisanship, when the first instinct was to ensure great power equilibrium and avoid mutually assured destruction.

They are not the only ones. A recent New Yorker profile makes it clearer than any:

Vladimir Putin presents himself to his citizens and to the world as the standard-bearer of a modern counter-enlightenment. He has declared liberal democracy ‘obsolete,’ a political arrangement that has ‘outlived its purpose. One of his historical role models is said to be Alexander III, a reactionary tsar in the Romanov dynasty who instituted draconian restrictions on the press, sought to ‘Russify’ his multi-ethnic empire, and mobilized against internal and external threats. Four years ago, Putin expressed his deep admiration for the tsar while visiting the Crimean Peninsula, a substantial and distinctly unthreatening parcel of Ukraine that Russia invaded in 2014 and has occupied ever since.

A Rabid Response to the New Right’s Power

There is a palpable panic at Carlson arguably driving the GOP towards a more pre-war conservatism. It’s even being hysterically termed Putinism and “Russia First” by some commentators. Michael McFaul, Obama’s Russia ambassador, was vocal on Twitter arguing that opposing Russia is a moral duty of anyone who opposes “imperialism,” alongside both prominent liberal theorists and second-tier neoconservative internationalist gadflies.

There has also been relentless fearmongering about Carlson, authoritarianism, and nationalism. Some have gone so far as to bizarrely tag Carlson a “comrade,” which is absurd because Putin’s Russia is far more Christian and conservative than the increasingly secular West.

“Why is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine?” Carlson asked, provoking commentary noting Putin murders dissidents. Yet the world is full of rulers who murderously abuse power—for example, by sending drones that kill non-combatants and children.

It cannot be a matter of American patriotism to send U.S. troops to die for evils in other nations, or United States must attempt to police the entire globe. Experience has shown that is practically impossible and deeply damaging to U.S. national interests.

Thus in recent years, the ascendant New Right has led a bipartisan push for a more restrained foreign policy, one predicated on cutting down on foreign entanglements (termed as foreign policy realism in academic circles) especially from the Middle East, pushing Europe to spend a lot more for its own defense, and focusing more on domestic issues, as well as the rise of China. Carlson is perhaps the most prominent voice of that school in the right and has consistently opposed needless foreign confrontation, especially over Iran and Russia.

Matt Walsh and Sohrab Ahmari recently also opposed further confrontation with Russia over ensuring democracy and rights in Ukraine, as this conflict does not directly threaten the American landmass or way of life. Prominent next-gen Republican lawmakers and foreign policy leaders, such as Adam Laxalt, Bernie Moreno, J. D. Vance, Blake Masters, and Peter Meijer also often voice more realist rhetoric.

Is It America’s Job to Change Other Nations’ Regimes?

This realignment has also included questioning whether the ascending conservative foreign-policy realism in America, based on a narrow definition of national interest, is compatible with progressivism. Progressivism, as John Mearsheimer noted, is by definition universalist, radical, and revolutionary.

Mearsheimer wrote, “because liberalism prizes the concept of inalienable or natural rights, committed liberals are deeply concerned about the rights of virtually every individual on the planet. This universalist logic creates a powerful incentive for liberal states to get involved in the affairs of countries that seriously violate their citizens’ rights. To take this a step further, the best way to ensure that the rights of foreigners are not trampled is for them to live in a liberal democracy. This logic leads straight to an active policy of regime change, where the goal is to topple autocrats and put liberal democracies in their place.”

Consider the relentless number of tweets by a section of the commentariat about Western support for ensuring LGBT-favoring laws in Ukraine, and Mearsheimer sounds prescient. Whatever these people are, their constant revolutionary and internationalist rhetoric would make Leon Trotsky blush.

Our Job Is to Govern Ourselves First

Foreign policy realism, on the other hand, enacts a grand strategy based on amoral narrow national interest, one formulated by early American statesmen from George Washington to James Monroe to John Quincy Adams. If it ever comes back as an administrative principle, then it will become the domain solely of the right.

The aversion against great powers and spheres of influence is an egalitarian instinct claiming all states are equal, regardless of any other variable. This instinct is by definition unnatural and revolutionary. It defies geography, aggregate power, history, and most importantly, narrow nationalism.

Believing that “History” is progressive, and therefore acting on it to liberate everyone everywhere and promote rights and democracy, then becomes part of an inflated American national interest. The side that does not believe in nation-states or nationalism cannot by definition side with a narrow interpretation of national interest.

It’s Natural to Defend Yourself

Carlson is increasingly influential because he sides with something very natural: a human urge to be a nationalist, and therefore opposed to a relentless and crusading global revolution, whether promoting a borderless Marxism or an equally borderless liberalism.

The ascendant New Right believes in peace through strength, and a very narrow Jacksonian definition of nationalism, in which Europeans pay for their own security and Americans only come at the last moment if things go wrong. In this view, China is a far bigger threat to American prosperity and its land-mass than Russia or Iran will ever be, and defending porous American borders matters a lot more to Americans than Ukrainian borders.

The other side, a duopoly of Never Trump neoconservatives and liberal-internationalists, wants to continue to allegedly ensure human rights across the globe while neglecting the way of life at home. It may be a noble goal, but ultimately it’s one that the majority of Americans and an overwhelming number of conservatives are tired of after 30 years, thousands of lost lives, and trillions of dollars in deficits.

The instinct for promoting a global revolution to promote LGBT rights, liberalism, and feminism is as radical an instinct as it can get, and that argument is increasingly opposed by a majority of Americans who simply don’t care enough to spend blood and treasure in places they cannot spot on a map.

Self-Government Means No Country Is Too Big to Fail

When Rhodes and McFaul yell about defending human rights in Ukraine, and Carlson and others on the right remind everyone of American failures in pursuing such an unlimited global policy, it’s important to rethink the priors and understand the re-alignment in foreign policy is complete. Powerful realist voices on the left such as Matthew Duss, Stephen Wertheim, Tulsi Gabbard, and Rep. Ro Khanna notwithstanding, it is becoming increasingly clear that true restrained foreign policy realism is connected to a very narrow form of nationalism, and that is fundamentally a reactionary and therefore conservative concept.

Second, as I wrote recently, “selling” such foreign policy, even to a very instinctively nationalist electorate like America, means talking in a language that most people will get. Carlson (and Donald Trump, for that matter) connected with the normal crowd, arguing about the futility of sending their sons to die for Ukraine, Afghanistan, or Libya. That has more impact than a bunch of Foreign Affairs Snapshots.

This recent debate on Ukraine, therefore, has brought forth troubling questions for those trying to sell oxymoronic “progressive” foreign policy realism, which took a hell of a beating in the last few weeks.

What To Know About Alex Vindman’s Lawsuit Against Trump Officials,"On Feb. 2, Alex Vindman, the driving force of the first impeachment of President Donald Trump, filed suit in a federal court in D.C. against Donald Trump Jr, the former president’s son; Rudy Giuliani, the president’s former personal attorney; Julia Hahn, the former special assistant to the president; and Daniel Scavino Jr, a Trump communications official.

Vindman’s lawsuit alleges the four defendants conspired to intimidate and retaliate against him, in violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. Here’s what you need to know about Wednesday’s lawsuit.

The Man Behind the Impeachment

Vindman was a director within the National Security Council charged with, among other things, listening to telephone calls between the president and foreign leaders. That included the July 25, 2019, conversation President Trump had with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

A so-called “whistleblower” later filed a complaint, purportedly under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA), claiming that in that call Trump had used “the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

The “whistleblower’s” complaint, however, was based solely on second-hand information, with the unidentified individual claiming he had learned that in Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call, the president had threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine unless President Zelensky investigated the Biden family and any role Ukraine had played in interfering in the 2016 election on behalf of Hillary Clinton.

News of the “whistleblower” complaint began swirling in mid-September 2019, beginning with release of a letter by Democrats Rep. Eliot Engel, chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. They demanded records relating to President Trump and Giuliani’s supposed “attempts to manipulate the Ukrainian justice system to benefit the President’s re-election campaign and target a possible political opponent.”

Trump short-circuited the circus by releasing a transcript of his telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart. It revealed that Trump had not threatened to withhold funds from Ukraine unless the country launched the investigations Trump believed appropriate. Later, Trump declassified and released a copy of the whistleblower complaint, which confirmed that the “whistleblower” had no first-hand knowledge of the call and was merely repeating gossip.

Schiff, who was leading this Ukrainian sequel to the Russian-hoax witch hunt, at first promised to bring the whistleblower before his committee to testify. But then news broke that before filing his complaint, the whistleblower “secretly worked with Rep. Adam Schiff’s Democratic staff.” Since then, the whistleblower remained undercover, although RealClearInvestigations identified the whistleblower as the CIA’s Eric Ciaramella.

With Ciaramella remaining undercover to protect Schiff, Vindman became the public face of the allegation that Trump had threatened Ukraine for political gain. But, according to reporter Byron York’s book on the impeachment, “Obsession: Inside the Washington Establishment’s Never-Ending War on Trump,” Vindman was not corroborating Ciaramella’s accusation. Rather, based on York’s exhaustive research, which included interviews with key individuals, Vindman provided the whistleblower the details about the telephone call to include in the complaint.

“Vindman was the person on the call who went to the whistleblower after the call, to give the whistleblower the information he needed to file his complaint,” Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., said. According to another senior congressional aide, “For all intents and purposes, Vindman is the whistleblower here, but he was able to get somebody else to do his dirty work for him.”

During his congressional testimony, Vindman refused to identify the whistleblower, but he testified that he talked to only two people outside the NSC, one being George Kent, a State Department official focused on Ukraine. Vindman and Schiff refused to identify the second individual, merely stating he was a member of the “intelligence community.” And when Republicans pushed for the identity of the second man, Schiff and other Democrats directed witnesses not to respond, to protect “the identity of the whistleblower.”

While Vindman became the Democrat’s “star” witness at the impeachment hearing, the majority of the media provided scant coverage of the details of his testimony. For instance, “Vindman repeatedly said that he viewed Trump’s phone call with Zelensky as ‘wrong,’ but he was unable to articulate precisely why.” Also, “he expressed frustration that the elected president was pushing a foreign policy at odds from the ‘interagency consensus’ of the bureaucracy that he felt should control foreign policy,” suggesting Vindman’s real complaint about Trump concerned the president’s policy judgments.

The House nonetheless impeached Trump. But within days of the Senate acquitting him, Vindman was transferred from the National Security Council—and for good reason. He later retired from the Army in July 2020. He now claims in his lawsuit that his removal from the NSC and eventual retirement were caused by an illegal conspiracy undertaken by Trump’s son and advisors, in violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.

The Ku Klux Klan Act?

As noted, Vindman sued the four Trump-connected defendants under the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. While Vindman’s reliance on that federal statute, which sought to address violence and other discriminatory practices in the Reconstruction South, strikes an odd chord, the Supreme Court has made clear that courts should give the various reconstruction statutes “a sweep as broad as their language.” The language on which Vindman relies in his first count, Section 1985(1), is indeed broad, providing:

If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States, or from discharging any duties thereof; or to induce by like means any officer of the United States to leave any State, district, or place, where his duties as an officer are required to be performed, or to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, or to injure his property so as to molest, interrupt, hinder, or impede him in the discharge of his official duties; the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.

Thus, to properly allege a claim under Section 1985(1), Vindman need not allege any racial bias. Rather, he merely needs to “allege four elements: (1) an agreement between two or more persons; (2) to participate in an unlawful act, or a lawful act in an unlawful manner; (3) an injury caused by an unlawful overt act performed by one of the parties to the agreement; (4) which overt act was done pursuant to and in furtherance of the common scheme.”

Vindman likely satisfied these pleading requirements in his 73-page complaint alleging an agreement between the defendants to unlawfully intimidate or threaten him from performing his duties as a NSC director and thereafter complying with congressional subpoenas and testifying as part of the impeachment proceedings. The defendants did this, Vindman alleged, by engaging in “concerted effort to falsely portray Lt. Col. Vindman as disloyal to the United States, as a spy for a foreign country, and as a politically motivated saboteur,” by, among other things, working with favorable media outlets, such as Fox News and specifically Laura Ingraham.

The complaint further alleged the defendants “conspired to falsely accuse him of leaking classified information and perjury,” again “for the purpose of both intimidating him from testifying in the impeachment proceedings and other proceedings implicating President Trump and continuing to hold his office, and to retaliate against him for doing so.”

The defendants did this, Vindman alleged, “by creating and spreading disinformation that they knew not only would be picked up by anchors at Fox News, but also amplified by other right-wing media outlets and across social media.” As a result of this conspiracy, Vindman alleged he was harmed both in reputation and in his career.

To Deter By Force, Intimidation, or Threat

Vindman also alleged a second count in his complaint based on Section 1985(2) of the Ku Klux Klan Act. Section 1985(2) prohibits conspiracies of two or more people “to deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, any party of witness in any court of the United States from attending such court, or from testifying to any matter pending therein, freely, fully, and truthfully.”

Courts have said that Section 1985(2) “prohibits conspiracies to interfere with judicial proceedings in federal court.” Thus, to sue for a violation of this section, “a plaintiff must allege (1) a conspiracy between two or more persons, (2) to deter a party, witness or juror from attending or testifying in any matter pending in any court of the United States, which (3) results in injury to the plaintiff.”

In this case, Vindman argues that the House proceedings constituted a “Court of Impeachment,” and that a Senate trial, if one were held, would likewise qualify the Senate as a “court,” within the meaning of Section 1985(2). While it is possible the district court will agree with Vindman, calling the House or Senate a “court of the United States” seems a stretch, meaning the defendants will likely succeed in obtaining a quick dismissal of the Section 1985(2) claims.

Conversely, Vindman’s claim under Section 1985(1) will likely survive for now because the court must assume the facts, as alleged, are true.

Discovery Will Be Lit

While Vindman may achieve an early victory in this case, first with the positive PR he is garnering and second by fending off any attempt by the defendants to have the case immediately tossed as frivolous, he may soon regret his decision to sue.

Unlike the House proceedings in which Schiff and other defendants ran cover for Vindman, allowing him to refuse to respond to relevant questions, federal discovery will not be so limited. And there will be much the defendants will want to know, such as with whom Vindman discussed the telephone call.

The defendants will also be entitled to question under oath a variety of other witnesses, including the whistleblower. Questions of Vindman’s bias will be fair game as well. Then there will be evidence the defendants will seek to gather to establish Trump had legitimate concerns about Hunter Biden’s involvement with the corrupt Ukrainian company Burisma.

In short, Vindman might just give Trump the impeachment trial he needed, with the witnesses he needed, to establish Vindman worked with the whistleblower and the whistleblower with Schiff to launch the Ukraine hoax.

Bad Timing

While it will be some time before discovery proceeds in this case, we are already discovering more details about the Biden-Ukrainian connection. And the timing of the release of that information couldn’t have been worse.

Just hours before USA Today hit the newsstands and Vindman’s attorneys filed his complaint, John Solomon reported that Just the News had just obtained a copy of a November 22, 2016, email sent by George Kent, the former U.S. embassy official in Kiev, to top State Department officials in the Obama-Biden administration. Kent is one of the two individuals Vindman discussed Trump’s telephone conversation.

In the email, Kent wrote, “The real issue to my mind was that someone in Washington needed to engage VP Biden quietly and say that his son Hunter’s presence on the Burisma board undercut the anti-corruption message the VP and we were advancing in Ukraine.”

“Kent’s email described an intense pressure campaign by advocates for Burisma — including a former U.S. ambassador — to rehabilitate the Ukrainian company’s corrupt reputation and to get Ukraine prosecutors to drop their criminal investigations of the company,” Solomon explained in his article that broke late Tuesday night.

Further, as Solomon wrote, in the email, Kent “relayed to higher-ups that he had confirmed with Ukrainian prosecutors that Burisma officials had paid a $7 million ‘bribe’ to make one of the cases against the company disappear. The bribe was allegedly paid at a time when Hunter Biden was serving on the Burisma board, a job that landed his firm more than $3 million from the Ukrainian energy company.”

Just the News had long been seeking this and other emails through a Freedom of Information Act Request, but for five years, “the State Department failed to acknowledge the existence of the document to the court or to Just the News in its multiple Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the State Department seeking records on Hunter and Joe Biden’s dealings in Ukraine,” Solomon explained.

The now-public email solidifies Trump’s concerns about the Bidens’ connections to Ukraine and possible corruption. That the State Department has withheld it for so long is especially troubling given Kent served as one of the Democrats’ key witnesses in the House’s first impeachment of former President Trump.

Kent’s email also strikes a sharp contrast to Vindman’s allegations that made news less than 24 hours later. In his complaint, after noting that “Trump zeroed in on former Vice President (and now President) Joseph Biden as his chief rival for re-election in 2020,” Vindman framed the Hunter Biden-Burisma scandal as non-existent, alleging: “President Trump and his allies seized on Hunter Biden and his position as a board member for the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma, and used allegations regarding Hunter’s efforts to leverage his relationship with his father for personal profit as a basis for attacking Vice President Biden.”

We now know, though, that it wasn’t just President Trump and his allies concerned about Hunter’s relationship with Burisma, but also top officials in the Obama State Department. Again, discovery is going to be lit.

7 Questions GOP Needs To Be Asking About Biden’s Response To Russia,"Before the Biden administration imposes sanctions on Russia, Republicans in Congress and the media should ask some hard-headed questions. In his many years as president, vice president, and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, every single U.S. foreign policy blunder has had Joe Biden’s fingerprints all over it.

Last year’s debacle in Afghanistan showed Biden true to form. And the same team of advisors who oversaw the Afghan fiasco—Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Gen. Mark Milley among them—are issuing dire warnings about Russia. Are you feeling reassured?

There is indeed a strong case that U.S. sanctions could cause severe economic hardship to Russia. But sound strategic thinking includes at least three components: a well-defined objective; the close adaptation of means to that end; and a careful consideration of the unintended but harmful side-effects that may follow. Here are some questions to review whether these criteria are being met in the Biden administration’s policies.

First, what is the objective of the sanctions? Most likely, the purpose of sanctions would be to deter Russia from invading Ukraine or to roll back a Russian invasion if one occurred. But the stakes are extremely high for Russia and for Vladimir Putin: to be seen to yield to U.S. pressure would be a severe blow to the régime’s prestige and might cause Putin to fall. Russia has long premediated an invasion or some lesser (to use Biden’s word) “incursion,” and has prepared for a U.S. blowback. And so far, Putin has not flinched.

But perhaps Biden’s true objective (as many Russians believe) is to bring about régime change in Russia. If so, the Biden administration owes it to the American people and our allies to be much more candid. An attempt to restructure the international order in such a fundamental way could easily lead to a major war. Also, even if we emerged “victorious,” the consequences for all concerned could be catastrophic.

Second, what would be the effects of our sanctions on our friends and allies, including Ukraine? Russia will surely respond to sanctions with counter-measures. Those could inflict a lot of harm on friendly nations. When Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in 2008, Ukraine’s economy took a 20 percent hit to national production. Does Biden think Ukraine would escape unscathed this time?

Also, what about Germany and other European allies that depend on Russia for natural gas? The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, although not yet opened, has been built to supply Germany’s energy needs with Russian gas. If, as State Department officials are saying, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will be just “a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean,” how would Germany obtain its energy?

We can hardly expect Germany to reverse its environmentally driven energy policy and start building nuclear power plants. We cannot construct LNG terminals fast enough to meet Europe’s near-term demands. And even if Russia wanted to sell gas to Germany, how could the Germans pay for it if Biden’s sanctions blocked the payments?

The Biden administration might carve out an exception for those transactions, but that would dilute the force and credibility of its overall policy. Little wonder that Germany, and indeed Ukraine, seem unenthusiastic about the war talk coming out of the Biden administration.

Third, are Americans prepared for Russian retaliation against the United States? There is no reason to think that the United States would be immune to Russian retaliation if our sanctions bit deeply. Since Russian financial institutions would be our primary target, it would be natural for Russia to respond in kind: Putin’s hackers could target our banks, stock exchanges, payment systems, and the like.

Russia could also launch a series of cyberattacks of increasing scope and severity. Are Americans willing to suffer such disruptions of their personal and financial lives?

Furthermore, Russian cyberattacks could provoke the United States to escalate the conflict. Where might such escalation lead? Russia has a modernized and formidable military. It is armed (as we are not) with battlefield nuclear weapons, and appears willing, in an extreme situation, to use them.

Are the American people ready and willing to fight a (potentially nuclear) war against Russia for the sake of a country that is of marginal national security interest to us? It’s unlikely.

Fourth, can the Biden administration count on our allies in Europe and around the world to support our sanctions? What level of enforcement can we expect from them? Our European allies were equivocal in supporting past U.S. sanctions against Iraq and Iran. Would they do better now?

What about our other allies? Russia cannot meet its need for semi-conductors; it has to look to outside sources for that vital commodity. This is a major Russian vulnerability. But can we be sure that South Korea, say, which is a major manufacturer, will not meet that demand, maybe indirectly?

Fifth, wouldn’t sanctions drive Russia and China even closer? The U.S. economic sanctions against Russia in 2014 promoted greater trade between those two nations. Will China stand by and watch Russia be strangled when increasingly the two nations are economic, military, and diplomatic partners? It seems more likely that China would enable Russia to circumvent any sanctions that Biden employs.

Any sensible administration would not want to force Russia into China’s arms. China is our main adversary. Russia, which is certainly not a friend but need not be an enemy, is no such threat. If any foreign nation should be in our cross-hairs for punitive sanctions, it is China, not Russia.

Sixth, won’t crushing economic sanctions hasten the day when powers like China and Russia bring down the global financial architecture that gives the United States such immense leverage? The more often the United States uses sanctions, the more determined our likely targets will be to create alternative global financial systems. Power is best conserved when its exercise is restrained.

Seventh, when have U.S. sanctions ever worked? As international relations scholars have argued, the effectiveness of economic sanctions is highly doubtful. We imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 after its invasion of Crimea: they obviously have not deterred Russia from encroaching again on Ukraine.

U.S.-sponsored sanctions against North Korea have not ended its nuclear program. The United States froze $9 billion in Afghan state assets after the Taliban took power: have those upended the Taliban? The United States maintained sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq for many years; and against Cuba for even longer. Were these success stories?

Let’s circle back to the start: What is the objective here? The core issue seems to be that Putin wants a promise from the West not to admit Ukraine into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and more generally to accept that Ukraine and Belarus lie within Moscow’s sphere of influence. Biden refuses to make that promise. Is fighting over this issue worth the risks—including, at the extreme end, the risk of war with a nuclear power?

Ukraine is currently not a member of NATO, and we have no treaty obligation to defend it. Moreover, the chance that Ukraine will become a member of NATO anytime soon is very low. It is too corrupt (as the Biden family should well know) and its political institutions too feeble to permit that. So Biden is asking the West, and the American public, to bear the costs and risks of his Russia policy for the sake of a hypothetical question about NATO’s future membership.

Republicans should not go along with this. Let Biden and his accessories in Congress, the media, and the permanent bureaucracy have full ownership of the Ukraine matter. Donald Trump is right: this is a matter for the Europeans to handle.

Republicans should also be searching for explanations of the Biden administration’s overwrought attitudes, including his lurid vision of the sacking of Kiev. Is a desperate Biden, faced with an overwhelming electoral disaster in next November’s midterms, “wagging the dog”?

Are the elites who manage our national security apparatus promoting international conflict, as usual, to advance their careers, burnish their credentials, and ratify their claim to be useful? And is the Democratic Party, obsessed by its irrational hatred and suspicion of Russia, letting its fantasies rip once again?

Sanctions rarely if ever achieve their intended effect. They usually do more harm than good. Republicans should not follow Biden into the abyss of sanctions. Certainly not unless he answers their questions first.

How Green Energy Fantasies Can Amplify Civil Unrest,"Policies that make energy scarce and expensive, promoted by wealthy elites, result in domestic unrest while diminishing a nation’s ability to vigorously pursue its national interests. Since 2011, this has been the case in Egypt, France, Kazakhstan, Germany, and others. Even California and Texas are grappling with similar problems.

Texas is approaching the one-year anniversary of its epic four-day electrical blackout, triggered by a polar vortex bringing record cold and freezing rain, but exacerbated by the state’s growing dependence on federally subsidized unreliable wind and solar.

That conservative Texas, America’s energy capital, isn’t immune to the trendy push to decarbonize at all costs, should be a warning that the forces of energy chaos are formidable. Decades of federal subsidies for wind and solar have caused those resources to be overbuilt in the Lone Star State, leading to extreme price volatility and distorted, sometimes even negative, wholesale prices.

Texas’s energy-only market relies on prices alone to incentivize new investment, and subsidies for more variable energy mean that the reliability of coal, natural gas, and nuclear is not properly valued. As a result, year after year, wind and solar capacity grow while coal and natural gas generation atrophy.

As this happens, the grid becomes more and more prone to blackouts — unless backup power sources are constructed. The question is, who pays? So far, reliability costs have been borne by consumers, giving unreliable wind and solar generators a free ride to produce electricity whenever they can and not paying for the cost of backup power or other costs arising from their volatility.

If the Public Utility Commission of Texas fails to properly account for these costs and assign them to wind and solar generators, in a few short years, this cost will become noticeable to voters, who likely won’t riot but will pay closer attention to energy issues. Higher costs and blackouts tend to do that to the average voter.

See Egypt, Kazakhstan, and France

The 2011 revolution that toppled Egypt’s long-time president, Hosni Mubarak, was triggered by technocrats who argued the regime could no longer subsidize the cost of food staples and cooking gas. The heavy energy subsidies encouraged a vigorous black-market trade as people made money by reselling natural gas and butane at market prices.

Much the same happened in Kazakhstan over the past month as officials struggled to improve an economy rife with corruption and inefficiencies. There, the government had heavily subsidized cheap, locally produced natural gas, which encouraged citizens to convert their vehicles to run on it. The subsidies became unaffordable to the government and were ended. Within weeks, violent street protests came close to overthrowing the government, with Russia leading a regional security force to put down the revolt.

Rising prices, fed by energy shortages made worse by policies intended to address climate change, are one big factor in a 244 percent increase in riots and anti-government demonstrations worldwide over the past decade. Such unrest isn’t confined to poor, developing nations.

In November 2018, the mouvement des gilets jaunes or “Yellow Vest” protests erupted in France. Their foremost demand: lower fuel taxes. In the name of fighting climate change, the government of President Emmanuel Macron had announced a 25 cents-per-gallon increase in gas taxes and 10 cents for diesel. That was on top of $7.06 per gallon gas, almost half of which is taxes. In less than a month, the French government reversed itself, but the Yellow Vest protests continued until Covid-19 shut them down.

Germany’s Failed Greening

Germany is a particularly vexing example of how political expediency can drive an entire nation off an obvious policy cliff. Germany made an early push to decarbonize (called Energiewende) while also decommissioning its nuclear power plants. This effort has placed Germany — and western Europe, by extension — at the mercy of Russian natural gas.

As recently as 1990, nuclear power generated almost 30 percent of Germany’s electricity. Last year, only 13.3 percent of German electricity generation came from nuclear power, with half of the remaining plants shut down in December. By the end of 2022, Germany will cease producing nuclear power.

The demand to end nuclear power in Germany was led by that nation’s Green Party, itself a product of Cold War fears over nuclear war. Even today, the triple party alliance that governs Germany — Social Democrats, Greens, and the Free Democratic Party — has opposed a European Union draft plan to label nuclear power as sustainable energy, putting Germany at odds with France, the Czech Republic, and Poland, among others.

Germans had been closing their coal-fired power plants, with coal’s contribution to the grid falling by almost two-thirds over the past 30 years. But the harsh reality of natural gas price increases and the unreliability of wind power saw coal rebound from 26 percent of the grid in the third quarter of 2020 to 32 percent in Q3 of 2021. Ironically, Germany has made up much of its electricity shortfall by boosting imports from nuclear-powered France, proving that anti-nuclear sentiments can’t energize the grid.

Despite the increased use of coal over the past year, German energy policy foresees the cessation of all coal mining by 2038, while renewable energy, mostly wind, is set to almost double in a decade. But, since wind is periodic and electricity storage is costly, Germany will still rely significantly on Russian natural gas, not only for electricity, but also increasingly for home heating and, of course, industry. In fact, in 2019, natural gas provided 25 percent of the world’s fifth-largest economy’s primary energy consumption, with 97 percent of that imported, mostly from Russia.

Germany’s dependence on Russian natural gas will grow when the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea comes online, allowing Germany to bypass its dependence on the Russian gas pipeline that transits Ukraine.

Dependence on Russia

The German domestic political considerations that birthed Energiewende, formalizing its dependence on Russian energy, have driven that nation’s realpolitik resurgence — it will do nothing to upset its energy supplier. This includes hamstringing North Atlantic Treaty Organization efforts to bolster Ukraine’s defense. On Jan. 21, Germany blocked Estonia’s export to Ukraine of former Soviet Bloc artillery systems.

Germany’s sensitivity to Russian interests is compounded by the fact that German — and European — winter stores of natural gas are at historic lows, about 28 percent below the five-year average. This comes as many German consumers are hit with 60 percent increases in electricity and natural gas heating bills.

Germany’s reliance on Russian energy has only grown since 2018, when former President Trump criticized Germany for being “totally controlled by Russia.” Astonishingly, Gerhard Schroeder, the former chancellor of Germany, was on the board of Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned natural gas company, until 2017, when he was named chairman of the board of Rosneft, Russia’s largest state-owned oil company.

California Divided over Energy

In California, tension over rising energy costs made worse by the left’s environmental policies haven’t yet resulted in violence, but they are causing tension within the Democratic Party. At a recent legislative hearing aimed at stopping California’s offshore oil production, an official with California’s powerful trades union, the State Building and Construction Trades Council, warned lawmakers they were making “classist” assumptions that “men and women will take whatever job is handed to them.” He said, “They want to do the job they were trained to do, and they want to do the job that they’re proud to do.”

Democrat State Assemblymember Mike Gipson, who represents Carson, an industrial city near Los Angeles (per capita income of $29,241), asked at the same hearing, “Do we save the tree or the person under the tree? … I represent people, and those people need to have jobs.” Gipson’s district is 87 percent Latino and black. Gipson votes as a moderate Democrat (at least by California standards).

Democrat State Assembly member Richard Bloom, who represents Santa Monica (per capita income of $75,481 — 121 percent higher than the U.S. average and 158 percent higher than in Carson) retorted, “We have to save the tree and the person under the tree. … You’re not saving a human if you don’t save the trees.” Bloom’s district is 17 percent Latino and black. Bloom is one of the legislature’s most leftwing members.

It’s hard to see the common interests shared by Gipson and Bloom, or Carson and Santa Monica, only 20 miles apart. In the meantime, California’s average electricity costs hit 19.99 cents per kilowatt-hour last October, the highest in the continental United States, discouraging the creation of manufacturing jobs in California while pressuring family budgets in Carson. Most Santa Monicans won’t feel the pain.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/04/how-green-energy-fantasies-can-amplify-civil-unrest/,2022-02-04
"In Russia Crisis, Ukraine Should Trade Land For Independence","When Viktor Yanukovych, the last pro-Russian president of Ukraine, was deposed in the midst of the Euromaidan protests in 2014, Moscow moved quickly to annex the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea. The reason for that was obvious: Crimea is the site of Sevastopol, traditionally Russia’s most important naval base in the world.

The 20-year lease Kiev and Moscow signed in 1997 was expiring soon, and now almost certainly would not be renewed. Moscow couldn’t risk losing the home base of its vaunted Black Sea fleet on a territory that had never been considered part of Ukraine before the ravages of Communism.

Along the Russian frontier in eastern Ukraine, on the other hand, Russia has moved more slowly, making its ultimate goal less obvious. The provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk in the region of Donbas declared independence almost at the same time as Crimea, but they were not annexed. Despite issuing 600,000 passports to residents of Donbas and funneling more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to there every year, Moscow has done virtually nothing to integrate the areas into Russia administratively. On the contrary, it is facilitating emigration from Donbas to Russia proper.

So what does Russia want now? Its principal demand of Kiev is the implementation of Ukraine’s obligations under the Minsk cease-fire agreements of 2014 and 2015, which are enshrined in U.N. Security Council Res. 2202.

Ukraine promised to let Luhansk and Donetsk conduct local elections under a special status law with guarantees of local autonomy and a general amnesty. In exchange, the separatists agreed to disband their “people’s republics,” lay down their weapons, and allow the Ukrainian military to regain control of all Ukrainian territory to the Russian border.

The agreements were never implemented, due largely to disagreements over sequencing. But now Ukraine seems to be walking away from them altogether. Ukraine has apparently decided that leaving the separatist areas under Russian control indefinitely may be preferable to implementing the Minsk Agreements and giving Russia a powerful lever over Kiev again. That might be right, and may be the real reason Russia is about to go to war.

What the USSR Left Behind

The map of Ukraine left behind by the Soviet Union in 1991 had no historical precedent in the history of the area before the Communist Revolution. Ukraine and Crimea came to Russia independently starting in the 17th century. Ukraine came in stages as Poland waned in territory, with the areas east of the Dnieper River firmly in Russian hands by the time of Peter the Great, while Crimea was captured from the Ottoman Turks.

Centuries later, after World War II, the Soviets wanted to give the impression of a diverse coalition of states, particularly in order to justify their demand for multiple seats at the United Nations, so Ukraine was presented to the world as a powerful Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1954, Premier Nikkita Khrushchev – a Ukrainian – “gave” Ukraine nominal control of significant territory and strategic forces, but it was all a show, because everyone knew the Kremlin retained total control.

When those borders suddenly became “real” in 1991, amidst the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kiev found itself in control of a nuclear arsenal, the Black Sea fleet, Russia’s most important commercial and naval ports in the world (Odessa and Sevastopol), and tens of millions of Russians. U.S. diplomats realized the situation was dangerously untenable, and quickly pressed Kiev to return the nuclear arsenal and Black Sea fleet to Russia. Unfortunately, the adjustments stopped there, leaving Ukraine with a bigger bite of Russia than it could safely chew.

A glance at the map of 1991 should have made people wonder whether Ukraine, in these artificially enlarged borders, could even be a viable state. It wasn’t at all clear that Ukraine would be strong enough to maintain both political independence and territorial integrity given the weight of vital Russian interests involved. “Russia is never as strong as she looks, Russia is never as weak as she looks,” the saying goes, and the map of 1991 reflected a state of Russian weakness that was bound to prove fleeting.

Ukraine had no problem controlling the territory as long as it accepted Moscow’s control. But the moment it definitively broke away from Moscow in 2014, it immediately lost control of those areas that were most vital to Russian interests, and nobody with an even minimal sense of Russian and Ukrainian history can pretend to have been taken by surprise.

Choosing Independence Over Territory

The years since have helped clarify Kiev’s priorities. The exclusion of Crimea and eastern Donbas from Ukrainian elections had a salutary benefit: There would henceforth be virtually no chance of a pro-Russian party winning an election in Ukraine. Understandably, Ukraine has upped the ante.

In 2017 it imposed an economic embargo on the separatist areas of Donbas, leading to their total economic collapse; they are now utterly dependent on Moscow, and good riddance as far as many Ukrainians are concerned. Perhaps even more infuriating from Moscow’s point of view, the most prominent Putin ally in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been under house arrest since May 2021, his television stations and other enterprises shuttered. Now Kiev is advancing a draft law “On the Principles of State Policy of the Transition Period” that would make the implementation of Minsk all but impossible.

What explains these moves is that Ukraine is now free of Russian dominance and is consolidating its political independence and increasingly westward orientation. But that could change if the Minsk Agreements are implemented, which explains why Russia is so insistent on their implementation. The Minsk Agreements – particularly their provisions on the reintegration of Donbas into Ukraine – represent Russia’s last hopes of maintaining political influence over Kiev by peaceful means.

Whatever military action Moscow is contemplating now will almost certainly be shaped by the overriding objective of political influence – not territory – and the United States should plan accordingly. Russia may decide to take territory instead, but if it does so violently, it is not likely to stop at the areas under its current control. It will most likely (at the very least) capture the hundred miles of coastline along the Sea of Azov that currently separate Donbas and Crimea. It’s important to keep in mind that if Russia’s objective was to annex the Donbas territories, it could have done so at any time since 2014, without the need for massing an invasion force on three sides of Ukraine.

Americans with only a thin understanding of Russian motives are thinking in terms of “domino theory.” They insist that if Russia isn’t stopped here, it will only go for more territory. Echoes of Sudetenland and “peace in our time” incline many of us to stand up to tyrants who would prey on peaceful democracies.

But Russia’s motives appear to be considerably more nuanced and carefully considered. Putin hates the settlement of 1991 and would change many things if he could. For example, he would love to have at least part of the Baltic States back. But he surely sees that any inch of territory of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member is hopelessly out of reach, and NATO must make sure the point is crystal clear.

But Putin seems motivated more by a desire to forestall further degradation of Moscow’s strategic position than by a desire to revise the settlement of 1991. In that sense, Moscow is reacting to events, as it did in 2008 when it invaded parts of Georgia, a preventive response to the Bush administration’s reckless suggestion of NATO membership for that former Soviet republic.

That brings us to the crucial question of NATO and the vital U.S. interests in the Ukraine crisis. It’s crucial to remember that in managing the liquidation of the Soviet Empire, it was never a goal of U.S. policy to separate Russia from Crimea or its Black Sea fleet, or otherwise dismember it. Such a goal would have jeopardized the whole objective of a peaceful end to communism in Europe, not to mention the dubious justice of continuing to punish the people who were arguably the principal victims of both Nazism and Communism, namely the Russians themselves.

The principle of territorial integrity and political independence of sovereign states is part of the bedrock of the international system, and the United States should reaffirm it always. But a nation’s commitments must always be calibrated to the weight of the interests involved, and a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine simply does not, in and of itself, implicate vital U.S. interests – leaving aside the fact that this dispute involves the historical territorial integrity of Russia as well as a newborn Ukraine.

For some, the Ukraine crisis implicates U.S. prestige, in tatters after the shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan. But prestige is a good reason not to make commitments that can’t be backed up.

NATO’s Mixed Messages

Confusion about NATO’s mission since the end of the Cold War has inevitably translated into confusion about how big the alliance should be. In 1999 and 2004, NATO expanded its membership to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the Baltic states. Including those countries made sense both geographically and in terms of shared values, interests, and national power.

But with the accession of Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and Croatia in 2004 and 2009, NATO expanded to include countries that were unstable, militarily weak, and economically moribund in a geographic area that was not vital for the survival of NATO. Worst still was NATO’s announcement that it “welcomed” membership for Georgia and Ukraine, a move that had no strategic justification and caused considerable alarm and anger in the Kremlin.

NATO is open to states that can qualify for membership, and Russia cannot be given any sort of formal veto rights under the NATO treaty. But that doesn’t mean that the composition of NATO is none of Russia’s business.

Russia points to the principle of “equal and indivisible security,” which the United States and its NATO allies have agreed to under auspices of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, as enshrining a commitment not to increase the security of one state at the expense of another. Historical examples abound to back this up.

For example, the proposed Anschluss of Germany and Austria in 1938 was very much the business of France and England, which should have gone to war to prevent it. And Russia is entirely within its rights to protest the stationing of strategic offensive forces in countries right on its borders, for the same reason the United States protested Moscow’s placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962.

Compromise isn’t always the same as appeasement. To give one prominent example, the idea of NATO membership for Ukraine, while it still claims sovereignty over Russia’s most important naval base in the world, is both preposterous and needlessly provocative, and there is no shame in admitting it.

Russia has continued to be a malign force in world affairs. But not all its grievances are unreasonable, and it is a dangerous mistake for Kiev and Washington to reject them all out of hand.

The United States and its NATO allies should recognize Kiev’s decision to prioritize political independence over territory, for it helps clarify the outlines of a peaceful settlement. The Ukraine crisis can’t last forever. And while Russia surely knows it can’t have everything it wants, if it gets some of what it vitally needs, perhaps Ukraine can, too.

How Green Energy Fantasies Have Put The World At The Brink Of War,"Europe’s aggressive leap towards “green” energy is proving to be a grave mistake.

As Europe braces for war on its eastern borders, the continent’s shift from cheap, reliable energy in the form of coal and nuclear to wind and solar has left millions, already struggling with a low-wind winter, dependent on Russian natural gas to meet baseload power needs.

After decades of transition, Europe now gets more than 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, making the continent far more susceptible to interruptions ordered by President Vladimir Putin as he prepares a takeover of Ukraine. And it’s not just gas. Russia is the dominant supplier of Europe’s oil and solid fuels, providing 27 and 47 percent respectively, according to the EU.

European dependence on Russian energy supplies was entirely self-inflicted. More than half a dozen European countries banned fracking over the last decade, and the Kremlin has kept reserves low after the continent knee-capped its own domestic production.

Germany is most dependent on Russian gas to compensate for when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. The nation continues to phase out coal and nuclear despite importing more than 70 percent of its energy supplies. The last German nuclear plants are scheduled to shut down by the end of the year, and its remaining coal plants abandoned by 2038.

“They’ve reduced the options or the bandwidth that European countries have available to them,” said Katie Tubb, a senior policy analyst for energy and environmental issues at the conservative Heritage Foundation, on Europe facing potential cutoffs. “I don’t think there is a rapid solution here in part because the EU has been going down this road currently for decades now.”

Decommissioned power plants do not come back online with the simple flip of a switch. Without coal or nuclear, natural gas is needed to fill the void left by unreliable wind and solar when they don’t produce. The continent’s fracking bans, however, have diminished its capacity to generate its own supply, leaving Europe vulnerable to Russian pressure and aggression.

Putin has weaponized Russian energy supplies before, even recently, raising European anxiety he’ll do it again even more aggressively. Last year, Putin’s refusal to ramp up European gas supplies as an energy crisis induced by a low-wind season gripped the continent was seen as an effort to strongarm officials into approving the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline into Germany. The finished pipeline would allow Russia to circumvent extensive Ukrainian networks in the event of invasion, which now appears close on the horizon.

Tubb told The Federalist a moderating factor in Putin’s decision to trim shipments is the extent to which the Kremlin relies on energy sales for income, which heightens the importance of Russia having an alternative route from what could become war-torn territory. But, Tubb cautioned, it’s “consistent to expect Russia sees its energy sector as an extension of its government and is therefore a political tool as much as it is a market participant.”

Russian dominance over European energy has already driven a fissure into western alliances, transforming Germany into an unreliable partner. Germany’s dependence was enhanced by President Joe Biden’s approval of the Nord Stream 2 last summer while the White House shut down power projects on American soil.

If not outright weaponized, Putin’s supplies have certainly bought influence, with German diplomats seeking exemptions from western sanctions so Berlin may keep its gas flow from Russia intact, according to the Wall Street Journal. Germany has also refused defensive weapons shipments to Kyiv as thousands of Russian troops descend on Ukraine’s border.

The United States, on the other hand, can’t meet German energy needs since American export terminals for liquified natural gas (LNG) are already operating above capacity. While new terminals are expected to come online this spring, Germany has no LNG terminal of its own.

The idea of a clean-energy future is not a fantasy. What is a fantasy is that such a future is achievable in the absence of nuclear power and fossil fuels, which drive innovation and adaptability to reach the aspirations for a cleaner planet. Cheap, reliable energy provides the foundation for development and new technology to emerge that enables adaptation.

Harris Heads To Secure Ukraine's Border But Won't Protect Her Own,"Image Credit The White House / Flickr

Vice President Kamala Harris’s excuse for not having visited the southern U.S. border last year during the Biden administration’s ongoing border crisis was “and I haven’t been to Europe.”

Now Harris is on official White House business in Europe, thousands of miles away from Biden’s border crisis, to bring “peace and security” to the borders of Ukraine. While border officials struggle to keep up with the 153,941 illegal aliens they encountered pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border in January, Harris is busy in Germany talking with other European leaders on how to “bolster unity as concern grows about Russian troops at Ukraine’s border.”

Does she ever plan to fly to Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas to help secure America’s border, or nah? https://t.co/jBFqLLXpmC — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 17, 2022

Biden tapped Harris as his border czar early last year, but it took her months to make a trek to observe the crisis her open-borders administration created. Initially, the VP claimed she was focused on the “root causes” of the migration influx and wasn’t in a rush to visit despite the growing humanitarian crisis and a record-breaking number of illegal aliens getting arrested trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border each month. When former President Donald Trump announced he was making a border trip himself, Harris quickly jumped on the bandwagon.

Harris finally arrived in El Paso in June of last year but failed to do much other than defend why exactly it took her so long to get there in the first place.

“Well, it’s not my first trip,” Harris said. “I’ve been to the border many times. So, the important aspect of this visit is leading this visit after the work that we did in Guatemala. … I’ve said back in March I’m going to come to the border. This is not a new plan, but the reality of it is that we have to deal with causes, and we have to deal with the effects.”

Now, just a few weeks in to the Ukraine-Russia tension, Harris is scrambling to lead the U.S. delegation at the Munich Security Conference in what some Democrat-fawning corporate media outlets have labeled the “most critical foreign trip of her vice presidency.”

While Harris threatens to take “corrective actions to ensure there will be severe consequences” against Russia if it invades Ukraine, she is silent on the extremely vulnerable U.S.-Mexico border ahead of peak illegal migration months and offers no plan of punishment for the human and drug smugglers exacerbating the crisis.

US remains supportive of diplomacy with Russia, ""but we are also committed to taking corrective actions to ensure there will be severe consequences"" if Putin goes ahead with an invasion of Ukraine, @VP Harris says in her 1st public remarks at Munich Security Conference. pic.twitter.com/vi19MIIewa — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) February 18, 2022

Instead of offering a plan of action or even reassurance to border states, which have to deal with the aftereffects of the Biden administration’s border negligence including increased illicit drug trafficking, Harris is parading around Europe calling attention to the problems of other nations while she ignores her own.

Harris is already extremely unpopular with Americans, and her refusal to acknowledge or address the border problems in the U.S. while actively advocating for the security of foreign borders is an even bigger slap in the face to voters who naively believed the Biden administration would make things better.

China And Russia Are Forming A Bond The U.S. Would Be Wise To Exploit,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a defiant joint statement last week. They affirmed their “strong mutual support for the protection of their core interests” and openly opposed the U.S.-led world order and value system. Many international observers saw the statement as a “manifesto” for a new multipolar world order in which Russia and China are united against the United States.

To demonstrate the strength of their unofficial alliance, Russia pledged it “supports a successful hosting by the Chinese side of the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Beijing in 2022,” undoubtedly snubbing at the U.S.-led diplomatic boycott of both games. Russia also affirms, “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and opposes any forms of independence of Taiwan.” In return, for the first time in history, China joined Russia in opposing any “further enlargement of NATO.”

The joint statement claims that the “friendship between [Russia and China] knows no limits.” But the questions remain how strong their alliance really is and how long it will last.

Former Enemies with Common Goals

Russia and China share a border that is more than 2,000 miles long and have fought numerous wars over border disputes. After Joseph Stalin died in 1953, the ideological divisions and power struggle between China’s leader Mao Zedong and USSR’s leader Nikita Khrushchev led to a drastic fallout between the two nations.

The USSR ceased economic and military aid to China and pulled out all Soviet technicians helping China industrialize its economy. Mao responded by severing the diplomatic ties with the USSR in 1967 and began to plot a pivot to the United States. The Soviets accused Mao of biting the hand that fed him. The two nations fought a bitter border war between 1968 to 1969, which almost led to World War III.

The two nations have only begun to deepen their relationship in recent years out of both fear and necessity. The biggest fear of both Xi and Putin is that “colored” revolutions, with the backing of the United States, will take place in their countries and overthrow their authoritarian regimes.

Both Xi and Putin face pressure from the West over their aggressions and human rights violations. Both wish to do away with America’s leadership, and the liberal world order America helped establish. Undoubtedly, this shared goal has brought China and Russia closer.

Since 2005, China and Russia have held joint military drills. They have also strengthened economic ties. Russia is “the second-largest supplier of crude oil to China and the third-largest provider of natural gas.” Bilateral trade reached $140 billion in 2021. Trade with China has helped Russia evade economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and western allies.

But there are plenty of reasons the Sino-Russia alliance is fragile in the long run.

An Unstable Alliance

Xi and Putin don’t fully trust each other, partially due to the long history of disputes and betrayal between the two nations. In addition, they have different policy goals based on their nations’ strengths and weaknesses.

Xi doesn’t see Russia as an equal partner but as a pawn to realize his vision for China, to replace the United States as the only superpower in a Sino-centered and autocracy-friendly new world. While China is Russia’s largest trade partner, Russia amounts to less than 2 percent of China’s total trade volume.

Xi has no intention of helping Russia become an economic powerhouse. According to Jon Yuan Jiang, a Chinese-Russian relations analyst in Australia, an economically weak but militarily aggressive Russia suits Xi’s vision. He prefers that the Russian military keeps the west, primarily the United States, occupied and draws attention from Beijing’s geopolitical expansion. At the same time, he hopes that Russia’s economic dependency on China will deter Putin from challenging China’s dominance.

Putin has no delusions that a new world order dominated by China will not bode well for Russia in the long run. His goal is to return Russia to what he sees as the glorious past of the USSR by all measures, including territories, military strength, and economic power. Putin is unsatisfied that Russia is a junior partner in the Sino-Russia economic relationship, and he recognizes that Russia’s economic dependency on China is a barrier to his goal.

These competing interests goals, alongside historical disputes, mean the Sino-Russia cooperation is limited.

An Opening for Biden

There are three things the Biden administration should do to exploit the friction between China and Russia. First, the Biden administration must reverse its energy policies that have benefited Russia.

Since coming into office, President Biden has imposed ruinous energy policies, including establishing a moratorium on leasing federal lands for oil and gas production and rescinding the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have added 830,000 barrels of oil a day to the world market. These policies resulted in skyrocketing gas prices, hurting U.S. consumers and economic recovery while creating a windfall for Russia, and providing Putin the financial resources to cause nuisance worldwide.

The Biden administration should instead lower the cost and remove the regulatory barriers for domestic energy producers to ramp up production. Since the energy sector represents 60 percent of Russia’s economy, lower oil and gas prices will hurt Russia’s economy. They may cost Putin the widespread support from the Russian people over Russia’s possible invasion of Ukraine.

Lowering energy prices worldwide will cause some clashes between China and Russia. As the world’s largest oil and gas importer, China welcomes any opportunity to pay less for energy resources. Beijing will rely on Russian partners less if it can find cheap energy imports elsewhere. Even if, for strategic reasons, Beijing has to maintain imports from Russia, the Chinese will drive a hard bargain on prices, which will undoubtedly cause resentment among Russians.

The second thing the Biden administration should do is focus on economic sanction tools that will drive China and Russia apart. Suppose Russia invades Ukraine, and the West responds by cutting Russia from the international banking system. In that case, China may want to put a distance between itself and Russia because China’s export-oriented economy is heavily dependent on such a system. Xi will have little appetite to jeopardize China’s economic growth to save Russia.

Finally, the United States should avoid outcompeting Russia in weapon exports in specific strategic markets. Russia’s economy is about the size of Italy, and it relies on two types of exports: energy and weapons. Putin has tried to diversify Russia’s economy to reduce Russia’s economic dependency on China, even if it means irritating China.

Russia exported $7.5 billion worth of military equipment to India from 2015 to 2019. Russia and India signed a new trade agreement in 2021, pledging to increase bilateral trade to $30 billion by 2025. India and China are rivals. With more than 1.4 billion people and nuclear weapons, India is the only Asian country that checks China’s growing geopolitical ambitions in Asia. China and India fought a bloody border war in the 1960s. Since 2020, the two nations have engaged in contentious border disputes.

India has been purchasing weapons from both the United States and Russia. China is particularly annoyed that Russia is arming India and expanding trade relations with Beijing’s rival. As long as India maintains a good relationship with the United States, the United States should not try to outcompete Russia in weapon exports in India. Russia’s continuing weapon exports to India naturally limit Moscow and Beijing’s cooperation.

As the saying goes, “There are no permanent friends, or permanent enemies; only permanent interests in international relations.” The United States should take the cooperation between China and Russia seriously while continuing to exploit opportunities to drive the two apart.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/18/china-and-russia-are-forming-a-bond-one-the-u-s-would-be-wise-to-exploit/,2022-02-18
Russia Is The Foreign Distraction Biden's Been Waiting For,"Image Credit The White House / Flickr

President Joe Biden has a myriad of domestic crises to deal with, but instead of taking on the issues that matter most to voters, he’s focused on a conflict with Russia over Ukraine.

While Americans struggle with unchecked inflation, bare grocery shelves, ongoing tyranny in the name of curbing Covid-19, rising urban crime, and trouble at the southern U.S. border, Biden is using Russia’s conflict with Ukraine to deflect attention from the fact that his administration is failing on the homefront.

For months, Biden’s popularity with voters has tanked. More than half of Americans disapprove of the job Biden has done, and even more, 72 percent, say the country is headed in the wrong direction. Even Biden’s own party is distancing itself from the president’s atrocious first year in office, especially after he failed to pass the Build Back Better plan despite having a Democrat-controlled Congress and wishing death on the filibuster.

That’s why the White House was excited when it realized that a U.S. response to an invasion across the globe could be the distraction voters needed to get their minds off of Biden’s domestic shortcomings.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration encouraged media coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Biden even told the world last week that because of the nation’s “significant intelligence capability,” he knew Russia would invade Ukraine, and corporate media outlets and warmongers ran with the story.

So far, though, voters aren’t buying it.

New polling shows that even Russia can’t save Biden from his disastrous track record. According to a Gallup poll conducted at the beginning of February, only 36 percent of U.S. adults approve of Biden’s handling of the situation with Russia. That’s one point less than Americans’ approval of Biden’s handling of the economy, which sits at 37 percent.

After Biden’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal, which cost at least 13 American lives and stranded thousands more, plenty of voters, at least 56 percent, disapprove of the president’s handling of foreign affairs — especially when there are so many issues he is ignoring at home.

Gas prices are up, drugs smuggled in by crime rings are pouring across the southern border as are hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, and Americans in cities are fighting off increasing violent crime, but mum’s the word from the president.

Biden and his team have epically failed in multiple ways. Despite the administration’s greatest efforts to call U.S. attention to a foreign conflict, Americans affected by Biden’s incompetence won’t forget all of the domestic crises he overlooked to focus on the Democrats’ favorite scapegoat: Russia, Russia, Russia.

The Ukraine Crisis Is A Direct Result Of Biden’s Weak Foreign Policy,"It’s hard to imagine a weaker, more impotent response to Moscow’s move against Ukraine than what the Biden administration announced Monday evening: an executive order imposing limited sanctions on two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic. The sanctions are a response to the Kremlin’s decision Monday to recognize these rebel-held regions as independent states. Early Tuesday morning, Russia deployed troops to these areas, calling them “peacekeepers.”

In a statement, the White House said the sanctions on Donetsk and Luhansk are separate from the “swift and severe economic measures” it would impose on Moscow, “should Russia further invade Ukraine.”

I’m sure Vladimir Putin is quaking in his boots. No further invasions, sir! That’s quite far enough.

More than anything, these incredibly unimportant sanctions from President Joe Biden underscore how the entire humiliating Ukraine crisis is a direct result of Biden’s weak foreign policy and feckless appeasement of Russia over the past year. A robust policy of deterrence, like maintaining the Trump administration’s sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that Biden waived last May, might have prevented the crisis.

But now it’s too late. The thing about deterrence is that you have to use it before your opponent makes his move. Russian forces are now on the ground in eastern Ukraine, and they’re probably there to stay. The time to get tough on Moscow and prevent a clash with Ukraine has passed. Sanctions, whether from the U.S. or from the European Union, are not going to force Putin to change his mind and retreat. Instead, these half-measures will give us the worst possible outcome: all the downsides of an actual military conflict, which is now certain, without the preceding benefits of deterrence.

What might those benefits have been? For one thing, we might have forced Putin to narrow the scope of his ambitions vis-à-vis Ukraine and engage in a negotiated settlement to the standoff — not because Putin wanted that, but because we made him understand that that’s all we would give him.

Too bad Biden’s team came into office and, by dropping Nord Stream 2 sanctions, immediately signaled to Putin that now was the time to press his longstanding aims in Ukraine. The pity of it is that the Ukraine crisis represented a rare possibility for a negotiated settlement in which all parties got some of what they wanted.

Indeed, the situation of Ukraine is historically unique. As Paul Pillar of Georgetown University has written: “The unusual circumstances of the historical Russian connections with Crimea and Nikita Khrushchev’s transfer of the territory’s administration from one subordinate unit of the USSR to another, followed many years later by achievement of independence by those units, does not really have an equivalent elsewhere.”

Given this history, my friend Mario Loyola has argued in these pages recently that with its current borders Ukraine can have territorial integrity or political independence, but it can’t have both. Remember, Ukraine’s present-day borders are the result of the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which had some forty years earlier given Ukraine artificially enlarged borders, including Odessa and Sevastopol, Russia’s most important commercial and naval ports. Once Ukraine broke from Moscow in 2014, its 1991 borders became untenable — and everyone, including the Ukrainians, knew it. Russia was never going to accept a westward-oriented Ukraine, still less NATO membership for Ukraine.

Admitting that, says Loyola, doesn’t amount to appeasement, and in fact it opens the way for a negotiated settlement:

Russia has continued to be a malign force in world affairs. But not all its grievances are unreasonable, and it is a dangerous mistake for Kiev and Washington to reject them all out of hand. The United States and its NATO allies should recognize Kiev’s decision to prioritize political independence over territory, for it helps clarify the outlines of a peaceful settlement. The Ukraine crisis can’t last forever. And while Russia surely knows it can’t have everything it wants, if it gets some of what it vitally needs, perhaps Ukraine can, too.

But for any of that to happen, the United States needed to have a firm, steady hand in its dealings with Moscow. In this, Biden failed miserably, coming into office with a lot of bluster about how he was going to take a firm line on Putin, that he alone knew how to deal with Moscow. During the 2020 campaign, Biden even suggested, ludicrously, that Putin didn’t want him to become president because of how tough Biden would be on him.

Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with him. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 21, 2020

The whole thing is reminiscent of the Obama administration’s handling of the Syrian civil war. Not just the weakness of President Obama’s embarrassing “red line” fiasco but also his refusal to do anything militarily to weaken the Assad regime before calling for a negotiated settlement.

The draft Syria resolution that the Obama White House sent to Congress in August 2013 authorized military force in connection to the use of chemical weapons but not in connection to any long-term U.S. goals in Syria, like a negotiated settlement that saw Bashar Assad removed from power. At the time, Assad’s removal was the stated policy position of the Obama White House. But by separating military force and a negotiated political settlement, as if the two could not work together, Obama guaranteed that any military force that was authorized would not alter the facts on the ground, and therefore would not weaken Assad’s position going into negotiations.

In the end, there were no negotiations because Assad never had need for them. He knew that the U.S. and its allies would not authorize military force sufficient to change the reality on the ground, so he crushed the rebel forces, killing a half-million of his own countrymen in the process.

In Ukraine, we now have a similar dynamic playing out, with the Biden administration calling for sanctions and international pressure after Moscow has already made its move. The time to put pressure on Putin and declare that an invasion of Ukraine would be a “red line,” has passed. Now, Biden is reduced to haggling publicly with our European allies over sanctions that will certainly be watered down given Europe’s energy dependence on Russia. Whatever they come up with, it will do very little to alter the facts on the ground, and do nothing at all to deter whatever additional plans Putin has for Ukraine.

Has Putin Miscalculated His Ability To Take Ukraine Swiftly?,"Image Credit The Russian Presidential Press and Information Office / Wikimedia Commons

The invasion of Ukraine by the armed forces of Russia at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s orders marks the first time since 1945 that Russia has engaged in a conventional war with a near-peer nation.

Ukraine isn’t restive Warsaw Pact nations, it isn’t Afghanistan, it isn’t Chechnya, it isn’t Georgia, and it isn’t Crimea.

The conflict launched by Putin is on a far grander scale than the invasion of Crimea in 2014, launched as Ukraine’s last pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, was driven from office in a popular uprising.

Putin, by choosing to reach beyond the ethnic-Russian majority separatist provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas Basin, has decided to end the independent, Western-looking Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and install a pro-Putin quisling.

And while the fog of war, some deliberate mis-and disinformation operations by the combatants, and the far-from-perfect filter of Western media leaves much unknown at this time, what is known is that Zelenskyy is still in power a day after the Russian offensive. Further, the Ukrainian military appears to be taking a toll on the Russians invading from three sides: south across the Pripyat Marshes from Russian satellite Belarus; west from Russia, including Donbas; and north from the Black Sea in the region of Odessa and Transnistria, a Russian client breakaway state in Moldavia.

Modern conventional war is extremely difficult to do well. Imagine being a conductor of an orchestra, all while the audience was lobbing soccer balls at you and your musicians as you perform J.S. Bach’s Chaconne in D — that’s modern warfare. Putin is attempting a highly complicated operation over large distances in the face of a determined foe. Further, he’s doing so with an army largely composed of conscripts serving for only one year.

Since Putin has decided to oust the Ukrainian government, this means that every day Zelenskyy remains in office is another day that adds to Ukrainian national confidence to resist — and another day that Putin looks to have miscalculated.

And as the war drags on, there are five things that may happen beyond the war in Ukraine.

First, Putin might expand the conflict even further—perhaps to the Baltic states.

Second, Finland and Sweden may seek to join NATO. We should let them.

Third, China may come to Russia’s aid in some form or view the conflict as an opportunity to attack Taiwan.

Fourth, volunteer units from Poland, the Baltic nations, and beyond, may seek to join the effort against Russia.

And lastly, if the Zelenskyy government survives and maintains the support of its people, Putin’s 22-year-reign will be in jeopardy.

Ukraine Is One More Problem Biden Tells Americans To Bear,"Image Credit The White House / Flickr

There are apparently not enough problems in the lives of average Americans right now, so we’re supposed to eagerly leap at the chance to stress over one that other people are having 5,000 miles away.

Hyperinflation unseen in decades, Latin America’s destitute pouring over the southern border, obscene levels of violent crime, and the ongoing struggle of parents to get their schools permanently open — all of that isn’t enough. President Joe Biden is ready to saddle us with more.

Speaking last week at the White House, Biden said the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine is now our burden to bear. “I will not pretend this will be painless,” he said. “There could be impact on our energy prices…”

You weren’t too bothered with high gas prices already, were you?

To be sure you heard him correctly, Biden said again on Tuesday that “defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home.”

And now Russia and Ukraine are all that the media are talking about, as if we aren’t separated by all of Western Europe and the entire Atlantic Ocean.

It’s not that Russia’s invasion of a small, fragile country doesn’t matter. It’s that Americans are supposed to feel anything but resentment over yet one more problem while enduring every other spirit-crushing entanglement either created or exacerbated by Democrats controlling Congress and the White House.

Was it not an option to first address all the murder, skyrocketing prices, and the endless COVIDiocy, and maybe then ask that we feel the Ukraine-Russia pinch?

Apparently not. A conflict in Eastern Europe that’s been going on for more than 30 years is something you’re supposed to consider just as important to your family as the soaring costs of groceries.

The Washington Post on Thursday did its damndest to explain why, exactly, getting in the business of Ukraine should be of utmost concern to all Americans, even though we would be “understandably” hesitant. “We already suffer from problems,” the paper said. Our interest is, however, according to the Post, “the peace and stability of Europe.”

That’s it. That’s the reason. If you aren’t overwhelmed with a sense of patriotism, an antsy readiness to feel more pain than you already do, well, the media don’t know what to tell you.

Again, “peace and stability” abroad is a good thing. The problem is that Biden and the rest of the Democratic Party have created multiple disasters in our own country and now we’re supposed to take on another nation’s chaos, too.

I’m sure you’re okay with that. You’ve been doing fine anyway.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/24/ukraine-is-one-more-problem-biden-tells-americans-to-bear/,2022-02-24
Biden’s Approval Sinks Further As Russia-Ukraine Crisis Heightens,"Image Credit The White House / Flickr

New polling indicates that only 39 percent of Americans approve of President Joe Biden’s job as president as the Russia-Ukraine crisis heightens.

According to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 56 percent of Americans think Biden’s first year in office was a failure. Among those unimpressed with the president’s track record of rising gas prices, a botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, and a growing crisis on the Southern border, are 66 percent of independents who will likely take their frustrations out at the polls in the upcoming 2022 midterms. Even 15 percent of Democrats admit that Biden’s tenure in the White House thus far has been a failure.

While nearly 40 percent of Americans think inflation should be Biden’s top priority, only 36 percent of them still support how the president is handling the country’s financial circumstances which are plagued with record-high inflation.

As Biden’s popularity drops, American support for U.S. intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict also remains low. Only about 10 percent of respondents said foreign policy should be Biden’s top priority right now. Most Americans are more concerned with what’s going on in the homeland and don’t want the president’s attention focused overseas.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll this week found most Americans oppose U.S. officials taking a major role in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis. At least 20 percent of Americans say the U.S. should have no role in the crisis at all even as it unfurls.

Overall, just 43 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s negotiations with Russia since he took office. That’s down 6 percentage points from June of last year.

Despite the lack of support from the American public, the White House continues to dwell on the conflict in Eastern Europe, distracting voters from the crises he’s created and exacerbated at home.

Biden's Russia Sanctions Atop His Energy Policy Are Failed Leadership,"President Joe Biden responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Thursday with a major sanctions package targeting Moscow’s financial institutions.

“Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time,” Biden said in a White House address, “as we squeeze Russians’ access to finances and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.”

Sanctions implemented with western allies aim to hinder President Vladimir Putin’s ability to finance the Russian military with export blocks on high-tech goods while additional measures target members of elite society, including Putin’s inner circle.

Absent from the package, however, is any lever to curtail Russian profits from its lucrative energy industry. Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh made that much clear at an evening White House briefing.

“Our sanctions are not designed to cause any disruption to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world,” Singh said, twice, leaving untouched a key source of revenue for the Kremlin.

Failure to go after the Russian energy sector is a consequence of western allies’ inability to do so without risking economic blowback beyond the boomerang effect already presented by this week’s sanctions. Europe is hooked on Russian gas after knee-capping its own capacity for instantaneous power through fracking bans while Russia produces more than 10 percent of the world’s oil. Prices of Intercontinental Exchange Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, already eclipsed $100 a barrel upon the eruption of Russia-Ukrainian tensions, with gas prices expected to soar beyond $5 a gallon nationally from levels already at seven-year highs.

Biden sought to reassure Americans concerned over the international turmoil translating into higher energy prices Thursday with a pledge his administration is using “every tool at its disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the pump.” Except he isn’t.

If President Biden were serious about countering Russian aggression, he’d unleash American oil and gas production to reclaim the energy independence forfeited within the span of a year. Instead, one of Biden’s first moves in office on day one was a suspension of new drilling leases on federal lands.

While overturned five months later, only to be quietly reinstated through a legal maneuver just last weekend, the halt in new lease sales sent a signal to Wall Street discouraging investment in the capital-intensive industry that suppressed production and drove up energy costs. Complemented by a cascade of taxes, environmental regulation, and outright bans on drilling, Biden’s energy policy implemented at the behest of his left-wing base has served as self-destruction for American energy independence, and with it, a key for negotiating with Moscow.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States is now forecasted to once again remain a net-importer of oil under Biden after a brief stint as net-exporter during the Donald Trump years. From Russia, the United States still imports nearly 600,000 barrels of oil every day. In contrast, the Keystone XL Pipeline Biden shut down was supposed to transport 830,000 barrels at peak capacity.

Biden didn’t sanction the Russian energy sector, because he couldn’t have. Trump could have, and probably would have. In fact, while Biden greenlit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline into Germany that would have enhanced a premier NATO ally’s already inflated reliance on Russian natural gas, Trump blasted the European energy deals as dangerous.

“It’s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia,” Trump told NATO Secretary-General Jens Soltenberg in 2018 during a trip to Brussels. “We’re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia.”

Nearly four years later, the western alliance is now paying the price for its dependency on Russian power. Germany, which sabotaged itself with a phase-out of nuclear and imports more than 70 percent of its energy supplies, became an unreliable partner in negotiations in the early stages of the Ukrainian crisis. While the nation axed plans to certify the Nord Stream 2 as a punishment for Putin’s move on Ukraine, more sanctions on Russian gas imports could present a severe disruption to its energy needs.

Russia had previewed its ability to manipulate European energy markets last fall when the continent suffered high prices from a low-wind winter, rendering unreliable wind turbines just that, unreliable. Putin refused to ramp up gas supplies as Europeans suffered through the energy crisis. While seen as an effort to strong-arm certification of Nord Stream 2, the effort may have also been a pretext for war, leaving European reserves “below the minimum volume” by December for the first time in five years.

A strong American energy industry operating at unleashed capacity could not only minimize economic pain domestically, but it could diminish the Kremlin’s influence in European markets as new liquified natural gas terminals continue to come online.

Capital and labor-intensive oil and gas operations, however, are no light switch, and Europe’s energy transition coupled with Biden’s negligence removed a primary cudgel for the west’s ability to taper Putin’s violent motivations. Yet President Biden has shown no signs to start the process of reclaiming American energy.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/25/bidens-russia-sanctions-atop-his-shortsighted-energy-policy-are-a-failure-of-leadership/,2022-02-25
"If Ukraine Survives, It Won’t Be Thanks To Biden’s Sanctions","The Russian offensive against Ukraine unleashed by Russian President Vladimir Putin is now two days old. There are two big things to consider as the conflict grinds on: strategy and morale.

The first is the survival of Ukraine’s young president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy and his democratically-elected government are the focus of Putin’s war. The German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz wrote, “The talent of the strategist is to identify the decisive point and to concentrate everything on it, removing forces from secondary fronts and ignoring lesser objectives.” Zelenskyy is that decisive point.

For an opposing force, the contrary is often true. In Ukraine’s case, it is — that is, the survival of Ukraine’s government and the prevention of the installation of a quisling, a pro-Putin government in Kiev.

But as von Clausewitz noted, “…no strategy ever survives the first engagement with the enemy.” Ukraine is fighting back. Whether it will be enough is an open question, though every day Zelenskyy’s government survives increases their odds of success.

The second factor, morale, is crucial. In that aspect, the Ukrainian people have seen some inspirational moments aided by rapid dissemination via cell phones.

The images of a helmeted Zelenskyy in the field with his soldiers invoke the memory of other wartime leaders, such as Winston Churchill during Britain’s darkest hour.

These images, and stories arising from the flames of Putin’s brazen attack, may serve as new historic foundation mythology for a very old nation.

America has the Boston Massacre with Crispus Attucks, the first martyr of the revolution, Molly Pitcher manning the cannon at Monmouth, and George Washington crossing the Delaware on Christmas Eve to attack German mercenaries on Christmas morning.

Ukraine now has Snake Island, with its 13 defenders telling a Russian warship to “go f— yourself” in reply to a demand to surrender. The Russians killed all 13 border guards.

The Ghost of Kiev as well — perhaps an urban legend, perhaps not — a Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot credited with downing six Russian aircraft — and racking up more than four million views on one video posted to Twitter on Friday.

And, of course, Zelenskyy himself, who, unlike the last feckless Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, remains at his post — though a successful relocation to Lviv in Ukraine’s west to carry on the fight would be preferable to death or capture.

And then there’s the Biden administration and its response to Russia’s offensive against Ukraine.

During his press conference Thursday, President Joe Biden responded to a question by claiming, “No one expects the sanctions to prevent anything from happening…” Days earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris said sanctions would deter Putin.

As to the sanctions announced by Biden, he said to give them 30 days to work. But the Battle of Ukraine will be won or lost by then.

Instructively, the Russian Ruble immediately gained 8 percent on Biden’s announcement of weak half measures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.5 percent in relief, and oil plunged by more than $4 a barrel on the word that Biden and our NATO allies would still welcome copious supplies of Russian oil and natural gas and pay for it in hard dollars.

War entails sacrifice. So far, the sacrifices are being shouldered by Russian conscripts and the Ukrainian people. The West? Not so much.

If Ukraine survives as an independent nation, Putin will fall, and Biden’s sanctions will have had nothing to do with his demise. The credit will be due to Ukrainian courage and Putin’s hubris.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/25/if-ukraine-survives-it-wont-be-thanks-to-bidens-sanctions/,2022-02-25
The Ruling Class Is A Far Greater Threat To Americans Than Russia Is,"Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine Thursday. He’d been fixing on it for a while. Most of the world knew it was coming.

By nightfall, their advanced forces had reached the capital city of Kyiv, and the situation looked dire. In the ensuing bloodshed, the internet was awash in hot takes. Not insignificant among them: That treason is amiss on the right, where our elites detect an insufficient support for the White House — and an insufficient hatred of Putin.

They’re shocked their bugles ring hollow in the ears of so many conservative and Christian Americans. Our lack of enthusiasm infuriates them to their core; they’re shaking with indignation.

So what’s the cause of this apparent treason? Why aren’t we charging? Why aren’t we all impressed with a government that’s afraid of racially profiling Chinese spies, or the carbon footprint of war in Europe? Why didn’t the Russians fear the diversity tweets of our NATO alliance, or our maternity flight suits and trans soldiers?

Why, they wonder, haven’t American conservatives flocked to their “racist” flag singing our “racist” National Anthem?

There’s no gentle way to say it, but the truth is that a lot of us hate our elites far more than we hate some foreign dictator. It’s a tough truth for the tough place our civilization is in — and surely, it’s a difficult truth for our ruling class to see amid the glare of their self-righteousness.

The Right To Rule

From Western Europe to West L.A., we know we’re governed by leaders in business, entertainment, and politics who hold scorn for our country, its history, its heroes, its people, and their religion.

They have the money and the power, too. They can freeze truckers’ bank accounts and mask children as young as three. They can order Australians into internment camps and host drag queen story hours. They can force vaccinations, close churches, arrest priests, bankrupt businesses, prosecute bakers, empty prisons, defund police, and sometimes even win votes.

One thing they can’t have, however, is the moral authority to rule a civilization they despise. They are the very thugs they claim to stand against; they have no legitimacy.

“But now is not the time for this squabbling,” we’re told. “Putin’s assault is an assault on the West!” But how can we take their call seriously, when they are the same leaders who ask if we can have schools named after Thomas Jefferson; the same who pine over what primitive tribes our land was “stolen” from?

Putin has no such qualms about his own civilization (and it’s one of the core reasons our elites hate him so). This week, he said Ukraine is Russia’s land, steeped in its religion, culture, and history, so Russia is taking it. Another hard truth is that amid a Western elite who has forgotten who we are, it’s easy to look abroad at our enemies and envy the confidence they have in their own civilizations. Why don’t our leaders have the same?

The very question infuriates them even further. How, they ask, can we not follow when they are the experts? The experts who told us “America was never that great,” or who questioned the American exceptionalism they now call on to defend the West?

Really: Who can follow a political left or establishment GOP calling us to defend Western civilization when just last week our culture’s triumphs were submitted as proof of our awful patriarchy? When they were apologized for?

Can we really take Ukraine’s inviolable border seriously, while defending our own is called racist?

Are we actually expected to ignore Putin’s claims of ancestral land rights in Ukraine, while we teach our school children to feel ashamed for living on land we say was stolen?

Of course not. These would be absurd.

“But how did this happen,” they ask. “How did conservatives turn on our rhetoric? On our wars?”

The only answer so many come to is, predictably, “Trump,” but the real culprits are in the mirror.

So Republicans and liberals can step up their podiums and their microphones and dismiss Putin as a mad dog and an enemy; after all, part of membership in our elite class is never having to think deeply.

But maybe — just maybe — in a moment of rare reflection, they might wonder why so many patriotic Americans aren’t following them. If they listen, a few might learn why so many are more interested in our enemies within, than their enemies abroad.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/25/the-ruling-class-is-a-far-greater-threat-to-americans-than-russia-is/,2022-02-25
"The West Could Have Prevented The Russo-Ukrainian War, But Didn't","Not every war is unnecessary or avoidable, but history might well judge the Russo-Ukrainian war as both, not least because the United States and its European allies could have prevented it, but didn’t.

The decision to go to war was Russia’s, and Russia bears ultimate responsibility for what happens now. But that does not absolve the West of its strategic incompetence and complacency, and it does not mean the United States and its allies are guiltless in all of this.

At multiple points leading up to the current crisis, there were ways for the United States and Europe to create off-ramps for both Moscow and Kyiv, to shepherd a negotiated settlement so that both sides got a minimum of what they needed, and some of what they wanted.

What might that have looked like? For Moscow, a recognition of its strategic claim on Crimea and the port of Sevastopol as the home of its Black Sea Fleet. For Kyiv, the promise of political independence and greater integration with Europe in exchange for territorial concessions.

The West should have also considered the folly and recklessness of floating the idea of NATO membership for Ukraine, something no serious person ever thought Russia would accept without going to war to prevent it. And yet as far back as 2008, the United States openly discussed the possibility of Ukraine’s membership in NATO, even as Kyiv still claimed sovereignty over Russia’s most important naval base in Sevastopol. Under these conditions, the idea of Ukraine joining NATO was preposterous.

Instead, for years now the West has encouraged Ukraine to take a hard line on Russia, with false promises that the U.S. and NATO would stand up to Moscow and defend Ukraine when it came down to it, or that Ukraine would become a NATO member and thus secure its untenable borders.

As the political scientist John Mearsheimer argued back in 2016, the West has been leading Ukraine “down the primrose path, and that the end result is that Ukraine is going to get wrecked. … What we’re doing is encouraging the Ukrainians to play tough with the Russians. We’re encouraging the Ukrainians to think they will ultimately become part of the West, because we will ultimately defeat Putin and we will ultimately get our way, time is on our side.”

Analysis & prediction on Ukraine from 6 years ago:



“The West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path & the end result is Ukraine is going to get wrecked.”

That encouragement — false encouragement, as it turns out — made the Ukrainians unwilling to compromise with Russian or consider Russian demands that were not unreasonable, given the historically unique circumstances of modern Ukraine’s borders and the problems those borders have always presented.

What’s more, the West’s encouragement of Ukraine did not match up with the West’s policies toward Moscow. You don’t tacitly commit to defending Ukraine from Russia while simultaneously making your nation energy dependent on Russia, as Germany and other European powers have done over the past decade, or flood your financial sector with billions from Russian oligarchs, as London has done.

The Biden administration not only encouraged European energy dependence on Russia (by waiving sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline last May) but substantially contributed to it by reversing the Trump administration’s achievement of U.S. energy independence. As my colleague Tristan Justice explains, President Biden’s energy policies have taken away the ability of the U.S. and its allies to sanction Russian oil exports, a key source of the Kremlin’s wealth:

“From Russia, the United States still imports nearly 600,000 barrels of oil every day. In contrast, the Keystone XL Pipeline Biden shut down was supposed to transport 830,000 barrels at peak capacity. Biden didn’t sanction the Russian energy sector, because he couldn’t have. Trump could have, and probably would have.”

All of this adds up to an historic failure by the West. For many years, the U.S. and its NATO allies knew that revisionist powers like Russia and China were unhappy with the post-Cold War international order, determined to revise it according to their strategic ambitions. It was up to the West, and especially the United States, to ensure that those attempts at revision did not take the form of all-out war, either on the European continent or in Asia.

Already, though, we see Beijing extending a hand to Moscow, calling for negotiations that could at this point only end with Russia achieving its strategic aims in Ukraine.

Simply put, the West has not done what is necessary to preserve the U.S.-led international order, and now that order is unraveling in real time.

"Zelenskyy Declines To Evacuate: 'I Need Ammunition, Not A Ride'","Image Credit Guardian News / YouTube

The Russian assault on Ukraine is now three days old with sharp fighting seen in the capital city of Kyiv overnight. Yet, Kyiv stands.

America offered to evacuate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy replied, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.”

“The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.” – @ZelenskyyUa on the US evacuation offer.



Ukrainians are proud of their President💙💛 — Embassy of Ukraine to the UK (@UkrEmbLondon) February 26, 2022

Zelenskyy’s reply was reminiscent of past heroes in times of war: Gen. Anthony McAuliffe who replied in “NUTS” in response to the German demand for surrender at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944; and the Texans striving for independence from dictator Santa Anna’s Mexico with their “Come and Take it Flag,” which was itself appropriated from Spartan King Leonidas and his response the Persian surrender demand at the Battle of Thermopylae.

This bravery, in a day when modern communications allow all Ukrainians and the world to see it, has rallied Ukrainians to defend their nation. And now that the fighting has gone on for three days, what might that mean?

Russian President Putin is said to have assembled 200,000 troops for the invasion. It is estimated that half of them have been committed so far. Further, Putin has called on 10,000 battle-hardened Chechen mercenaries. More than half of Russian forces are likely committed to the battle of Kyiv.

Ukraine has 245,000 active-duty members, but most are in the east, facing the Russian-led and equipped militia in the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine also has another 220,000 reservists. Many of these are spread across the nation slightly larger than the state of Texas.

The strategic target is Kyiv and its independent government. To move the reservists to the fight, they must contend with Russian air superiority, slowing their march. More importantly, given this struggle for national survival, 7,000,000 men of military age and fit for military service are taking up arms. Every day, many more older men — and many Ukrainian women — are also being issued weapons, making Molotov cocktails, and joining the fight.

The ongoing Ukrainian mobilization means that the Russian military will soon be outnumbered most everywhere on the battlefield. The Ukrainians may not have the same level of modern equipment — missiles, jets, helicopter — but they have numbers and will power. And, the Russians need to eat, they need fuel, and ammunition — their resupply trucks must get through. They won’t, not in large enough numbers; everyday Ukrainians will see to that.

Kyivians need to eat as well. Perhaps Putin’s operational plans are to surround the city of three million and starve it into submission, forcing Zelenskyy to surrender to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. Of note, images of fighting overnight show streetlights still working in the capital city meaning refrigeration is still working, stretching out food supplies by a few days.

But as Putin’s offensive falters and his strength back home is questioned, there’s another, more sinister possibility: He’ll unleash thermobaric bombs on Kyiv. These massive conventional weapons would destroy entire city blocks, killing 10,000 civilians and soldiers at a time. But terror bombing rarely cows the target into submission. Rather, the use of these superweapons will further spur Ukraine and the world against Putin.

Putin would fall shortly after his use of the thermobaric weapons, or he’ll try to take the rest of the world with him.

The war in Ukraine is likely to expand beyond Ukraine. War rarely unfolds as intended.

"As Europe Rallies To Ukraine, Putin Rattles His Nukes","It’s now five days since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his mostly conscript army into Ukraine to overthrow the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and it hasn’t gone as planned. In what may signal frustration, Putin has put his nuclear forces on alert in one last desperate move to beat his chest and show the world who’s in charge.

Time has given some clarity to the operation and allows the drawing of some conclusions.

I’m a retired Army lieutenant colonel—an intelligence officer. My training, from 1983 to 2007, was a Cold War focus on the old Soviet Union, the predecessor state to the Russian Federation. Never in my time as an intelligence officer was I able to see the worst-case scenario of a large-scale conventional Russian attack in Europe—until now.

I’ve seen multiple reports of Russian conscripts who didn’t know they were invading Ukraine. They’re confused. They don’t know who to shoot at, as “Ukrainians look the same as us.” The Russian force appears to suffer from: Poor training; poor leadership (bad officers); and a cultural disregard for information-sharing down the chain of command, which prevents lower-ranking soldiers from making informed decisions in the chaos of war.

The result of all this is a lack of initiative from soldiers when non-commissioned officers and officers are killed or wounded.

It is important to note that the Russian army hasn’t fought a conventional war against a near-peer enemy since 1945. It’s out of practice, poorly trained, poorly led, and poorly motivated. It does have plenty of heavy armaments—very large thermobaric bombs. It can destroy, but it can’t fight effectively.

Regarding the “Father of Bombs,” a large thermobaric or “vacuum” bombs capable of destroying a city block, killing 10,000 or more civilians and soldiers. Using one on Kyiv would horrify the world and likely increase calls for war crimes charges on Russian leaders. The Russians have used smaller thermobaric weapons against Ukrainian bunkers.

This opens another question: How powerful are Russia’s reconstituted zampolit? Putin brought them back in 2018. The zampolit were political officers in the old Red Army, previously called “commissars” until 1942 when the position’s battlefield power was scaled back in response to negative military command implications.

If a Russian field commander is ordered to use a city-busting thermobaric bomb, will he? Or will he refuse to carry out the order, like German Gen. von Choltitz when Adolf Hitler ordered him to destroy Paris—unless a zampolit is looking over his shoulder with a pistol?

Logistics is also manifesting itself as a Russian weak spot. Logistics is hard—it’s harder in combat. It requires synchronizing the delivery of fuel, ammo, and food to frontline forces all while the enemy is shooting at your resupply trucks. At four days in, Russian forces are running out of basic supplies. This has a powerfully negative effect on morale.

Complicating Russian resupply efforts are indications that Ukrainian light forces hunkered down during the initial Russian wave passed by, only to reemerge when the lightly armored supply columns entered Ukraine. Also of note is the increasingly effective Ukrainian use of Turkish-designed BayraktarTB2 drones. These low-cost, slow, non-stealthy drones have scored dozens of kills on Russian columns. Ukraine has about 60 of them.

As Ukrainian resistance stiffens and tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens rush to defend their nation, other nations in the region have been emboldened. Germany is sending 1,000 antitank missiles and 500 Stinger antiaircraft missiles. The Czech Republic and the Netherlands are sending small arms and ammunition.

The SWIFT financial communications system is being turned off for Russia. European nations are closing their airspace to Russian commercial aircraft. Now the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has used the term “war” to describe Russia’s assault on Ukraine, invoking the provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention, allowing Turkey to block Russian warships from the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.

All of this suggests a growing willingness to confront Putin’s aggression. Even at home, protests against Putin’s war are growing bolder in Russia.

Putin needs friends. China has distanced itself. Kazakhstan denied Putin’s request for forces. And now Putin is pressuring his Belarusian puppet, President Alexander Lukashenko, to join the fight along its 674-mile-long border with Ukraine.

But Lukashenko’s armed forces are even less capable of fighting than their Russian cousins and the border with Ukraine is defined by the vast Pripyat marsh. Even so, the likely objective of a Belarusian assault would be the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, the main route through which Western supplies enter Ukraine.

Putin’s aggression likely won’t end well for Putin.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/28/as-europe-rallies-to-ukraine-putin-rattles-his-nukes/,2022-02-28
Biden’s Feckless Energy Policies Are Making The Ukraine Crisis Far Worse,"Image Credit JoachimKohlerBremen/Wikimedia Commons

After blocking such sanctions last year using a national security waiver, the Biden administration announced Wednesday it would allow sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia’s Nord Stream 2, a natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Germany’s Baltic coast. While the sanctions are one of many possible responses to counter a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the reversal invites the question of why the Biden administration empowered President Vladimir Putin with increased power over global energy supplies in the first place.

In 2019, under former President Donald Trump, the United States became energy independent for the first time in 62 years, meaning we produced more energy than we consumed and exported more than we imported. The Trump administration achieved this in part by streamlining regulations that hindered U.S. pipelines and natural gas development on federal lands.

When President Joe Biden took office, he reversed this progress. In an attempt to appease climate activists, his administration placed moratoriums on oil and gas leases on federal lands and made it harder and more expensive to produce natural gas.

In May 2021, the Biden administration officially reversed Trump-era sanctions against the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing the project to move forward despite bipartisan opposition in Congress and warnings from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that doing so would undermine American national security. During the same period, the Biden administration obstructed pipeline development at home and in some cases killed these projects altogether. Pipelines are OK so long as they’re not in our own backyard, so the logic goes.

Lost Independence

Now, America is no longer energy independent, and instead of the United States exporting natural gas to Europe, these nations look to Russia. Not only does Russia have an obvious track record of manipulating energy costs for its political benefits, it is also much less environmentally conscious, and therefore ends up releasing more emissions than the United States does when producing the same natural gas.

For an administration expressing alarm about climate change, this is not a good look. Of course, it also handed Russia — an aggressive, corrupt, authoritarian human rights disaster — massive geopolitical power that we’re watching Putin leverage today.

In Germany, for example, well more than half of the country’s natural-gas imports come from Russia. “This partly reflects Germany’s high dependence on gas in its energy mix, after the country phased out nuclear energy and is now exiting coal-generated power under a plan to shift entirely to renewable sources by 2045,” reports the Wall Street Journal.

This is what happens when Western leaders put Greta Thunberg in charge of energy policy: Countries substitute nuclear power — one of the cleanest, most reliable forms of energy — with renewable energy sources that are not yet ready for primetime, opening the door for thug dictators to take over sovereign countries. Expect oil prices, which already are surging to prices not seen in seven years, to get worse.

Biden to Blame

None of this is to excuse Putin’s flagrant violation of international law, or to place blame for what’s happening in Ukraine on Biden. But like Biden’s deadly and disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, the extent of this crisis was entirely avoidable.

The Biden administration chose to flush precious geopolitical leverage down the drain by making the United States and European allies once again dependent on hostile regimes instead of empowering our energy sector. It furthered policies that actively discouraged American oil production, then went to the Organization of the Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) begging for help.

After decades of being dragged into wars in the Middle East over these very resources, we should have known better. But alas, Biden was there making that happen, too.

What’s that saying? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

The Biden administration’s refusal to harness America’s own natural resources, while increasing our reliance on these same resources from adversarial nations, is a hypocrisy that’s too dangerous to ignore. Energy independence is not just a “climate issue.” First and foremost, it’s a national security issue, essential to preventing catastrophes like we see unfolding before us today.

Taiwan Deserves Better Than A Joe Biden Presidency,"As Russia continues its military onslaught against Ukraine, the impending threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has also become a hot topic among foreign policy analysts in legacy media.

For years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made clear its intention to capture the island nation, with incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and threats of military force becoming more frequent in recent years. With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, however, there is growing concern that such long-held desires by China to forcefully annex Taiwan could materialize sooner than originally anticipated.

Since the beginning of Russia’s blitzkrieg against Ukraine, the CCP has wasted no time in ramping up its propaganda efforts over its fictitious territorial claims to Taiwan. During a press conference last week, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying publicly declared that “Taiwan is not Ukraine” when discussing comparisons between the two geopolitical flashpoints, while adding that Taiwan “has always been an inalienable part of China” and that such a claim “is an indisputable legal and historical fact.”

China’s state-run media has also joined in the fray, with Global Times commentator Hu Xijin saying on Thursday that Taiwan should “get used to” People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft entering their airspace, while also threatening that there “may be more PLA aircraft fly there [Friday].” The tweet came in reply to a Thursday report from Taiwan’s defense ministry that documented nine PLA aircraft entering the southwestern region of the country’s ADIZ.

In response to a potential uptick in military aggression from China, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has taken precautionary measures to maximize her nation’s regional and national security efforts. During a meeting with a working group tasked with overseeing the Ukraine crisis by her National Security Council last week, Tsai reportedly emphasized that all military and defense forces on the island “must raise their surveillance and early warning of military developments around the Taiwan Strait.”

“But in the face of foreign forces intending to manipulate the situation in Ukraine and affect the morale of Taiwanese society, all government units must strengthen the prevention of cognitive warfare launched by foreign forces and local collaborators,” she said.

Joe Biden’s Weakness Invites Aggression

Whether it’s the invasion of Ukraine or the prospect of military action against Taiwan, the ability of rogue actors like Russia and China to advance their geopolitical goals without fear of significant consequence can be traced back to the weakness of one man: U.S. President Joe Biden.

Throughout his short tenure as president, Biden has overwhelmingly failed to institute a foreign policy that instills fear and uncertainty in antagonistic nations on the international stage, thus leading to a much more unstable global political climate. As noted by Federalist senior editor John Daniel Davidson for instance, the current invasion of Ukraine can be directly attributed to the feckless approach to Russian aggression perpetuated by Biden and his administration.

“[T]he United States needed to have a firm, steady hand in its dealings with Moscow,” writes Davidson. “In this, Biden failed miserably, coming into office with a lot of bluster about how he was going to take a firm line on Putin, that he alone knew how to deal with Moscow … The time to put pressure on Putin and declare that an invasion of Ukraine would be a ‘red line,’ has passed. Now, Biden is reduced to haggling publicly with our European allies over sanctions that will certainly be watered down given Europe’s energy dependence on Russia.”

Coupled with his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and willingness to leave his own country’s borders wide open to potential foreign hostiles, Biden’s weakness telegraphs to the world that America isn’t led by a serious commander-in-chief who’s willing to enforce red lines when needed. For countries like China, which seeks to dethrone the United States as a regional and global hegemon, Biden’s four years in office are a political gift that permits them to fast-track and achieve objectives that were unattainable under the Trump administration.

Taiwan Deserves Better U.S. Leadership

For the people of Taiwan, the looming prospect of a Chinese invasion now threatens to destroy all that they’ve built over their nation’s history. What was once an island under strictly enforced martial law in 1949 has now become a fully-fledged democratic, capitalist society where the concepts of individualism and personal liberty are widely cherished.

With Biden sitting in the White House, however, such remarkable accomplishments are now at risk more than ever. As Biden continues to fumble the ball on major foreign policy ventures and exemplify weak U.S. leadership to the world, Xi Jinping and the CCP are likely to become even more emboldened to escalate their military activities in the Taiwan Strait and accelerate plans for forced annexation of Taiwan.

With its sovereignty and safety under increasing threat, the very least U.S. leadership could do for Taiwan is to emulate strength and dominance in the face of Chinese aggression. Instead, Taiwan is left with an American president whose incompetence jeopardizes the free society they’ve fought so hard to achieve.

Elites Only Care About 'Misinformation' When It's Politically Convenient,"If there’s anything the last two years have taught us, it’s that the members of our ruling class are obsessed with characterizing information they disagree with as “misinformation” that threatens the integrity of our democracy. As Ukraine and Russia duke it out, however, Democrats, so-called neocons, and the corporate media have conveniently glossed over the large swaths of disinformation, war propaganda, and fake news plaguing sites like Twitter because it supports their warmongering agenda.

There is no shortage of fake stories that have driven Western coverage of the ongoing Eastern European crisis. Posts about the Ghost of Kyiv, a Russian tank crushing a Ukrainian civilian in his car, and members of the Ukrainian military telling the Russians to “go f-ck yourselves” before dying, went viral and were amplified by major media outlets but they are questionable, outdated, incorrect, and even flat-out propaganda.

5/ Another incorrectly labelled clip on Twitter claims to be of a Russian airstrike on Ukraine ""that caused a chain reaction at the Luhansk power plant."" The video actually shows footage of 2015 Tianjin blasts in China.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who was recently censured by Republicans for his anti-conservative behavior and previous lies, was one of the many purveyors of fake photos and storylines meant to drudge up emotional responses to the overseas conflict. One look at Kinzinger’s Twitter profile reveals dozens of posts amplifying verifiably false information and outdated photos for the sake of echoing pro-Ukrainian sentiments and encouraging U.S. involvement.

https://twitter.com/RepKinzinger/status/1497325588423524362?s=20&t=DFf_0OGe5f4BCf5TRdRoPg

Every useful or pleasing claim about the war, no matter how unverified or subsequently debunked, rapidly spreads, including by US news outlets, while dissenters are vilified as traitors or Kremlin agents.



No matter your views, having falsehoods ratified is dangerous and harmful. pic.twitter.com/oGTt8dTnz8 — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 27, 2022

Kinzinger and other blue check marks’ ignorance about what’s actually going down in Ukraine is a cause for concern, especially since many of them have claimed to care about misinformation in the past. But because supporting Ukraine appears politically advantageous, people like Kinzinger seem to be off the hook.

“There was of course in the early hours of the war, a moment that went viral on social media about these Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island saying to a Russian warship, ‘go blank yourself.’ They were going to go down fighting. Well, the Ukrainian Navy just put out the fact that they’re actually alive. Those soldiers didn’t die in that, but it doesn’t matter because that became a rallying cry over those few days here,” MSNBC’s Jonathan Lemire insisted on “Morning Joe” on Monday.

The same politicians and corporate media who justify political censorship in the name of protecting “democracy” are suddenly unbothered by clear misinformation being pumped out of Ukraine and Russia.

For years, Democrats and the media have painted themselves as vigilant keepers of truth. They make big, sweeping gestures calling for censorship and host conferences focused on deliberately suppressing unfavorable narratives.

The Biden administration teamed up with Big Tech last year to kill Covid narratives that didn’t line up with health bureaucrats’ guidance. Corporate media aided in “fact-checking” news about Hunter Biden’s corruption. President Joe Biden even went so far as to say misinformation on Facebook is “killing people.”

The ruling class’s treatment of the origins of Covid, the 2020 summer of rage, the Russian collusion hoax, Jan. 6, and so much more has taught us that reckless rhetoric is only punished if it’s disadvantageous. For someone like Kinzinger, who supported a witch hunt against his own constituents in the name of preventing “insurrections,” spreading lies in the name of supporting Ukraine is beneficial for Democrats and neocons and doesn’t need to be suppressed or corrected.

Very few people are qualified to speak about the crisis in Ukraine so anyone who is boldly tweeting hot takes or fake pictures from video games is participating in an information operation whether they know it or not. This kind of misinformation about the Russia-Ukraine conflict should be concerning to the elites who normally whine about disinformation, but it is not because they only care about suppressing reckless rhetoric when it silences their political opponents and moves the agenda forward.

17 Absurd Lies Biden Told During His State Of The Union Speech,"In a desperate bid to console a nation reeling from crises he created, President Joe Biden delivered his first official State of the Union Address on Tuesday.

The Democrat attempted to downplay his plummeting approval by promising to do better in his second year in office but instead offered a speech riddled with falsehoods and contradictions.

While Biden’s address was supposed to breathe new life into his presidency, Americans are meanwhile plagued with rising prices, a southern border crisis, and now an overseas conflict that leaves them feeling like “the State of our union is in crisis because of Joe Biden.” Here are 17 absurd lies Biden told during his State of the Union speech.

‘Freedom Will Always Triumph Over Tyranny’

Biden opened his speech by praising the lack of Covid-19 theater in the legislative chambers and claiming that “freedom will always triumph over tyranny.”

The audacious claim comes just a few months after the president tried to force the coronavirus jab on American workers, pushed his administration to work with Big Tech to censor his political opponents, and smeared Republicans as domestic terrorists for caring about their children’s education.

Powerful Sanctions Stopped Russia

Days after Biden said U.S. sanctions against Russia weren’t expected to “prevent anything from happening” in the Ukraine conflict, the president claimed that he leveraged powerful punishments against Vladimir Putin, which stopped the Eastern European in his tracks.

“A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world,” Biden said. “And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy.”

Twenty-four hours before Biden’s contradictory statement, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the sanctions “are meant to have a deterrent impact” against Russia.

Vice President Kamala Harris, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and other Cabinet members also promoted sanctions as a way to stop Putin from invading Ukraine.

I’m Always Honest

Biden told Americans, “I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised,” but The Federalist’s regularly updated lie tracker proves that claim is far from the truth.

Well, that's a lie…



""To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised."" – Joe Biden — Nathan Brand (@NathanBrandWA) March 2, 2022

‘The American Rescue Plan Worked’

Biden touted the American Rescue Plan as a significant boost to the economy that “helped working people and left no one behind,” but he neglected to mention it was this sudden influx of federal cash in a slowly rebounding economy that contributed to the inflation and rising prices plaguing Americans today.

Trump’s Tax Cuts Only Helped the Rich

Biden repeated the popular lie that former President Donald Trump’s tax cuts helped only the rich even though they actually increased worker earnings and opened up job opportunities across the board.

Biden lies about the Trump tax cuts, saying they only benefited the rich. — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 2, 2022

His false claim earned a round of boos from the Democrat politicians in the audience who were eager for a chance to take a jab at Trump.

Biden lied. In 2018, following passage of the TCJA, the top 1% paid more in income taxes than the bottom 90% of taxpayers – combined. Sounds like their “fair share.” #Bidenlied. — Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) March 2, 2022

‘I Created Lots of Jobs’

Biden touted the rising U.S. job record as one of the highlights of his first year in office but failed to mention that the only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of a virus.

Biden lied. 6.5 million people returning to work following pandemic lockdowns is not the same as creating 6.5 million new jobs. #Bidenlied. — Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) March 2, 2022

Buying American Products Is a Priority

Biden said buying American products is a priority for his administration but has conveniently avoided reinstating U.S. energy independence by cutting off Russian oil supplies and lifting his ban on American drilling.

Biden’s lie also ignored the fact that the White House recently defended buying at least $1.3 billion worth of Covid-19 rapid tests from China to disseminate to Americans instead of relying on locally-sourced ones.

‘Our Economy Roared Back Faster Than Almost Anyone Predicted’

Biden claimed that “our economy roared back fast than anyone predicted,” but as average Americans suffer the consequences of a prolonged supply-chain crisis and inflation, it’s clear that the price hikes once touted by the administration as short-term are here to stay for a while.

“Our economy roared back faster than anyone predicted.” – Biden before blaming said economy on inflation and supply chain crisis — . (@JoeConchaTV) March 2, 2022

The Solution to Inflation Is ‘Lower Your Costs’

Biden claimed that the solution to inflation is for businesses to “lower your costs, not your wages,” but anyone with a brain knows that in order to stay open, companies must raise their prices to pay for increasingly expensive goods. If businesses are forced to raise their wages, they will also raise prices for consumers who have to bear the burden or suffer the consequences of understaffing.

Biden: ""I have a better plan to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages."" — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) March 2, 2022

My Tax Plan Will Lower Costs and the Deficit

“My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit,” Biden claimed.

The truth is, however, that Biden’s tax plan would “result in a net increase in the deficit totaling $367 billion over the 2022-2031 period, not counting any additional revenue that may be generated by additional funding for tax enforcement,” according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Biden again falsely claims that his #BuildBackBroke agenda won’t raise taxes.



💡 Fact check: a @TaxPolicyCenter report shows that Biden’s tax plan will raise taxes on 75% of families in one year, and 95% in 10 years. Another @WhiteHouse lie. — Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D. (@RepGregMurphy) March 2, 2022

You know how Joe Biden always lies? Well he just claimed only gun manufacturers are immune from prosecution & no other industries are…did you know vaccine manufacturers are immune from prosecution??? #SOTU — Nathan Dahm (@NathanDahm) March 2, 2022

Anyone Making Less Than $400k Doesn’t Have to Pay More Taxes

Biden also repeated one of his favorite falsehoods that anyone making less than $400,000 a year doesn’t have to pay any more in taxes.

Experts, however, agree that his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year is ambitious and not realistic because those who fall below the mark are still subject to consequences from a highly taxed economy.

Biden just repeated the lie that no one making less than $400,000 will pay ""a penny more"" in taxes.



Buddy, we're all paying the tax of inflation. #SOTU — John Cooper (@thejcoop) March 2, 2022

Let’s Lower Cost of Insulin (After I Raised It)

Biden called for lower insulin prices amid what he said is a drug price crisis. What the president didn’t acknowledge, however, is that he undid a rule enacted by Trump that effectively lowered insulin and epinephrine prices for Americans

Joe Biden is the one who raised the price of insulin after Trump lowered it.



Unlike you, we have our minds and can still remember things, Joe.



Give the lies a rest. #SOTU — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) March 2, 2022

Funding Police Is Necessary

Funding for police, Biden said, is suddenly a big priority for his administration, but when rioters called for harm and financial cuts to police forces around the country during the 2020 summer of rage, Biden refused to condemn them.

The president also allies himself with Democrats who proudly call for “racist” police forces to lose their funding.

Here are 7 minutes of Democrats saying we need to defund the police. It’s amazing they try to say they never argued for this. pic.twitter.com/1t24aghO4T — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) March 2, 2022

The Right to Vote Is Under Assault

Biden claimed the “right to vote is under assault” by states passing voter-integrity laws but failed to mention that Democrats and their cronies in Big Tech and the corporate media were the ones conspiring to rig the 2020 election. As The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway reported:

Hundreds of laws and processes were changed in the months leading up to the election, sometimes legally and sometimes not, creating chaos, confusion, and uncertainty. Tech oligarch Mark Zuckerberg, one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful men, spent $419 million — nearly as much as the federal government itself — to interfere in the government’s management of the election in key states.

Pro-Democrat propaganda in the media and censorship of conservative voices and damning stories such as the New York Post’s report on Hunter Biden also contributed to the plot to take over elections.

Gun Manufacturers Are Immune to Lawsuits

Biden said gunmakers are immune from prosecution even though manufacturers can be sued if a firearm is faulty or malfunctions.

Big Biden Lie: gun manufacturers are the only industry that can’t be sued.



Truth: If guns malfunction, the manufacturers can be sued. Not so with vaccines! — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 2, 2022

On the other hand, many of the manufacturers who created the Covid-19 jab are immune to prosecution, despite Biden’s claims that the gun industry is the only one afforded special privileges.

You know how Joe Biden always lies? Well he just claimed only gun manufacturers are immune from prosecution & no other industries are…did you know vaccine manufacturers are immune from prosecution??? #SOTU — Nathan Dahm (@NathanDahm) March 2, 2022

‘We Need to Secure Our Border’

Biden said he wants to secure the southern border and that he’s taking swift action to do so. The truth is, however, that more than 100,000 illegal migrants are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border each month after the administration touted open borders and overlooked the humanitarian crisis for more than a year.

Biden not only started his presidency by stripping border protections enacted by Trump but welcomed illegal migrants with open arms. As a result, Border Patrol encountered at least 2 million illegal aliens at the southern border in 2021 alone and are expected to encounter even more in 2022. Many of these illegal aliens were released into the U.S. with loose instructions to report to ICE facilities but didn’t.

Abortion Is Health Care

“If we want to go forward — not backward — we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose,” Biden claimed during his speech.

Killing babies in the womb, however, is not health care. Not only does the heinous act take the life of an unborn child, but it has detrimental effects on women’s physical and mental health.

Biden Will Promote Energy Agenda Despite It Hampering Diplomacy,"In his annual State of the Union Address on Tuesday, President Joe Biden is planning to double down on the “clean” energy agenda that’s limited diplomatic options with Russia.

Showcased in preview materials released by the White House on the eve of the address, the president aims to “call on Congress to deliver on a legislative agenda for clean energy and climate action.”

“Specifically, the President will lift up the benefits we can secure for American consumers, companies, and communities by enacting critical investments and tax credits for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment,” the White House wrote. “He will also highlight how the investments and tax credits would cut energy costs for American families an average of $500 per year.”

In his first State of the Union, @POTUS will urge Congress to deliver on clean energy investments that create jobs, reduce emissions, and save families $500 a year. His address tomorrow will build on a wave of climate actions we've taken to start 2022. https://t.co/7xEipg3xy1 — Gina McCarthy (@ginamccarthy46) February 28, 2022

The White House’s current agenda has already raised power prices to seven-year highs.

Absent from the pre-release, which touts offshore wind, electric vehicles, and costly new regulation, was any mention of the energy independence forfeited by the administration within the last year.

After Biden shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline and suspended oil and gas leases on federal land, the U.S. doubled is imports of Russian oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. The writers at PolitiFact rated the claim “mostly false” despite its own explanation of the score saying the opposite: “The U.S. did double the amount of crude oil imported from Russia last year.”

In December, the U.S. imported more than 400,000 barrels of Russian oil on average daily. The Keystone Pipeline, in contrast, transported 830,000 barrels at peak capacity from the Canadian Tar Sands.

After the president suppressed domestic production, leading to high power prices throughout his tenure, the White House has maintained its refusal to interrupt global energy markets with sanctions on Russian oil and gas, the world’s third-leading oil producers responsible for 11 percent of the world’s supply. In a press call on Monday morning, the White House made that clear.

“We’ll continue to scope out measures to allow for steady energy supplies to global markets,” said a senior administration official, with energy transactions exempt from financial sanctions.

The Energy Information Administration forecasts that this year, the United States will be a net importer of oil — a reversal from a brief stint as a net-exporter when the United States achieved energy independence during the Trump years.

Faced with an electorate antagonized by high gas prices as a consequence of the administration’s animosity toward fossil fuels, Biden will likely only go after the Russian energy sector as a last resort. Doing otherwise in the absence of a radical shift in White House energy strategy would inflict undue harm on American consumers and create a political nightmare beyond the red wave already expected during the November midterms.

The European shift to green energy in the form of wind and solar already gave the continent a crisis last year when it was hit with a low-wind winter. The European Union’s enhanced reliance on Russian natural gas to fill the gaps for instantaneous power generation spell disaster.

According to numbers from the Russian Finance Ministry reported by Reuters, oil and gas revenues generated $119 billion for the Kremlin, some at the courtesy of the American taxpayer, even as Moscow restricted supply to Europe to artificially spike prices and keep European reserves low ahead of its Ukraine invasion.

In the U.S., such a transition to wind and solar has brought rolling blackouts and the failure of the Texas power grid.

Michael Shellenberger, the president of Environmental Progress, explained in a guest post for Bari Weiss’s Substack column on Tuesday how Russian President Vladimir Putin exploited the West’s obsession with “going green.”

“It was the West’s focus on healing the planet with ‘soft energy’ renewables, and moving away from natural gas and nuclear, that allowed Putin to gain a stranglehold over Europe’s energy supply,” Shellenberger wrote.

Any White House strategy to reclaim energy independence in the near future without unleashing domestic oil and gas production is deeply unserious. Beyond green fantasies, however, the White House has no agenda to reclaim energy independence, empowering the Kremlin to continue financing its war machine on Russian resources.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/01/biden-plans-to-double-down-on-energy-agenda-while-dependency-hampers-diplomacy/,2022-03-01
How China Is Taking Advantage Of The Ukraine Crisis,"Image Credit Bruce Detorres/Flickr

After months of buildup, Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun his long-planned invasion into Ukraine. While all eyes are on Russia and Ukraine, China has wasted no time taking advantage of the situation.

First, China made another show of force to Taiwan. A few hours after Russia’s invasion began, Taiwan reported nine Chinese aircraft had entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Even though China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) recently increased both the frequency and the number of fighter jets it sent near Taiwan’s ADIZ, the timing of the most recent incursion was unmistakably tied to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.

China’s move on Taiwan serves multiple purposes. One is to fend off any international comparison of Taiwan and Ukraine.

After British Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed concerns that the outcome of the Ukraine crisis might affect the future of Taiwan, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson insisted that “Taiwan is not Ukraine. Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China.” Beijing reinforced this message by sending fighter jets to Taiwan’s ADIZ as the Ukraine crisis unfolded, demonstrating that it will do whatever it wants to Taiwan, whenever it chooses.

The PLA’s show of force was also meant to intimidate both the Taiwanese and their government. As the rest of the world is witnessing bloodshed in Ukraine, Beijing wants to warn the Taiwanese that they could easily be next, so it is better to give up any resistance now.

China Working to Assist Russia’s Aggression

Besides intimidating Taiwan, China quickly offered support to Putin’s aggression through economic means, enhancing China’s economy while bolstering Russia’s economic dependency on China.

Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Putin and Chinese leader Xi Xinping announced their alliance by issuing a defiant joint statement before the Beijing Winter Olympic Games’ kickoff. They made it official that a new multipolar world order has arrived, in which Russia and China are united against the United States. Besides the joint statement, Xi and Putin signed several trade agreements, committing China to purchase a significant amount of agricultural and energy products from Russia.

Shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, China announced it would lift all restrictions on wheat imports from Russia. Beijing previously imposed such restrictions due to concern about plant diseases in agricultural imports. Agricultural product exports play a vital role in Russia’s economy and the nation is the world’s largest wheat exporter. Amidst western sanctions, China’s purchasing orders will provide some relief to Russia’s economy.

Beijing didn’t do it out of altruism. Due to environmental pollution, increasing demand from a growing population, and the supply chain affected by Beijing’s “zero Covid-19” restrictions, China has been facing food shortages. Therefore, increasing food imports from Russia will help Beijing address food security.

Working Together to Undermine the U.S.

Stepping up wheat imports is only the beginning of the economic lifeline that China is supplying Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions on four large Russian banks and restrictions on certain Russian state-owned enterprises from raising money in international markets. These sanctions are unlikely to have a much-desired impact on Russia because Russia is increasingly relying on China’s alternative banking and capital market systems through the Chinese currency-based payment system.

Chinese leaders believe that to replace the United States as the sole world power, Chinese currency, yuan, must become a widely used international reserve currency like the U.S. dollar. China has encouraged foreign governments to use yuan for trade settlement and foreign companies to issue yuan-denominated debt in China’s capital markets to facilitate the yuan’s internationalization. In addition, China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, launched the first phase of the China International Payment System (CIPS) in 2015 to ease trade settlement and investment denominated in the yuan.

Even before invading Ukraine, Russia had increased its reliance on Chinese currency and CIPS to blunt the financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies. The South China Morning Post reported that “about 17.5 percent of trade between China and Russia was settled in yuan in 2020, marking a big increase from 3.1 percent in 2014.” In addition, “Chinese currency accounted for 12.8 percent of Russian foreign exchange reserves in 2020 and 30.4 percent of its sovereign-wealth-fund holdings in July last year.”

China’s ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, reportedly told a Russian TV station the day before Putin invaded Ukraine that China was “pleased to see that its currency has been widely used in Russian trade, financial investments and foreign reserves.” Zhang expected to see more yuan settlement in the two nations’ energy deals. These comments indicate China is taking advantage of the Ukraine crisis to speed up the yuan’s internationalization and to position its own payment system as a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar-dominated international financial system.

China Sees Russia as its Pawn

Xi doesn’t see Russia as an equal partner but as a valuable pawn to realize his vision for China — to replace the United States as the sole superpower in a Sino-centered and autocracy-friendly new world order. An economically weak but militarily aggressive Russia suits Xi’s vision.

Xi deploys China’s economic power to support Putin, counting on the Russian military to keep the West, primarily the United States, occupied and to draw attention away from Beijing’s geopolitical expansion. Meanwhile, the more Russia is economically isolated from the western world due to sanctions and becomes more economically dependent on China, the less likely Putin’s Russia will present a threat to challenge China’s dominance.

Shockingly, the Biden administration has failed to recognize China’s strategic calculations so far. The New York Times reports that Biden administration officials shared intelligence on Russia’s troop buildup with China, hoping Beijing would help avert Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Chinese officials rebuffed the United States and apparently shared the information with Moscow.

The sooner the Biden administration abandons the delusion that China will be a responsible world power in solving the Ukraine crisis, the better the United States can focus its resources on responding to Russia’s aggression with the most effective means.

"In Russian Diplomacy Leaks, Biden Exposed Scary Weakness On China","The Biden administration’s weakness and incompetence were on full display in a New York Times article last week recounting the White House’s repeated—and failed— attempts to urge China to help avert war in Ukraine. The purpose of the article was to allow senior administration officials to take their duplicitous Chinese counterparts to task, but the account reveals above all that White House officials are out of their depth in dealing with China.

It is nearly impossible to read the Biden administration’s side of the story without perceiving the weakness, gullibility, and ineffectiveness that the Biden White House unwittingly presents. Administration officials describe how they were “repeatedly rebuffed” by Chinese officials even as the Americans scrambled for “half a dozen urgent meetings over three months” to try to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The article repeats how “Each time, the Chinese officials… rebuffed the Americans,” as if to drive home the humiliating point.

These rebuffed Americans are quickly recast as duped Americans. Biden officials disclosed to The New York Times that they shared intelligence with their Chinese counterparts only to be double-crossed when the Chinese quickly leaked that intel to the Russians.

To add insult to injury, the Chinese also told the Russians that the Americans were “trying to sow discord,” and promised Moscow that Beijing would not interfere with Russia’s war plans. The Biden officials who leaked these details must not be aware of how embarrassing they are.

The article then provides a background on the growing public partnership between the Russian and Chinese autocrats, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, with their countries’ ties appearing stronger than any time since the Cold War. U.S. officials figured that if anyone could talk Putin out of an attack on Ukraine, it was Xi, given that Putin and Xi have met 37 times as national leaders. But Xi didn’t, and Chinese officials “persistently sided with Russia.” The Biden officials were for some reason puzzled about why.

The next few paragraphs incidentally unravel this mystery, although the Times author and the unnamed Biden officials don’t see the answer in their own account. It’s worth explaining it here, if only for the benefit of the Biden officials. America and China opened up 50 years ago, and for the first 40 years of that partnership the relationship between America and China grew stronger. For the last ten years, however, China has grown closer to Russia.

When China was weaker and threatened by what was then the Soviet Union, it turned toward America. After decades of aid, investment, technology transfer, education, and lucrative trade with the United States, China is now much stronger than Russia. Its population is much larger, its gross domestic product is ten times bigger, and its technologies (many stolen from the United States) are better. China has much less to fear from Russia, and thus can leverage Russia against America—the only remaining superpower stronger than China.

One way to pit Russia against America is to give tacit support for a Russian war in eastern Europe that will consume America and her allies, while letting China see how the West responds to an invasion analogous to what China has planned for Taiwan. And that’s exactly what China did.

A cynic might even point out that such a war and its fallout might displace the world’s unpleasant memories of China’s horrifying behavior in unleashing and spreading the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and stonewalling investigations into the virus’ origins. In addition, Russia might even be reduced to a client state to supply commodities to China. That wouldn’t be a bad turn of events by the Chinese against a country that used to threaten them.

But back to the Times story. What comes next should remind Biden officials, and all Americans, of the Wuhan pandemic. When Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine, China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the United States, not Russia, was “the culprit of current tensions surrounding Ukraine.”

“On the Ukraine issue, lately the U.S. has been sending weapons to Ukraine, heightening tensions, creating panic and even hyping up the possibility of warfare,” she said. “If someone keeps pouring oil on the flame while accusing others of not doing their best to put out the fire, such kind of behavior is clearly irresponsible and immoral.”

Hua then refused to call Russia’s attack on Ukraine an “invasion” when pressed by reporters. Such rhetoric should sound familiar, because less than a year ago The New York Times reported on how China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly floated conspiracy theories accusing the United States of starting the coronavirus pandemic. Nonetheless, Biden officials were somehow surprised at Hua’s remarks: “Hua’s fiery anti-American remarks as Russia was moving to attack its neighbor stunned some current and former U.S. officials and China analysts in the United States.”

President Biden should discover which officials were stunned by Hua’s remarks and replace them with competent realists. The same goes for the administration officials who leaked this story to The New York Times without realizing how it exposes their own weakness and incompetence, and President Biden’s.

The article then jumps to another case of naivety, this time courtesy of an on-the-record statement from Evan Medeiros, a former member of President Obama’s National Security Council, who laments: “They claim neutrality, they claim they stand on principle, but everything they say about the causes is anti-U.S., blaming NATO and adopting the Russian line…The question is: How sustainable is that as a posture? How much damage does it do to their ties with the U.S. and their ties with Europe?”

Medeiros teaches about U.S.-China relations at Georgetown University. In case his rhetorical question ever appears on a Georgetown exam, here is the answer: China’s posture is sustainable for as long as American officials keep falling for it without imposing consequences.

The article then recounts a meeting between U.S. officials and the Chinese ambassador, Qin Gang, at the Chinese Embassy in November, in which the Americans tried to trap the ambassador in a “gotcha!” moment by letting him know they caught China helping Russia evade sanctions after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea. The Americans warned the ambassador against helping Russia again, saying the sanctions would be tougher this time, and that China’s “global image could suffer” if Russia invaded Ukraine. “The message was clear: It would be in China’s interests to persuade Mr. Putin to stand down.”

Yet when the Chinese calculated their own interests, they concluded it was very much in their interest to give Putin the green light. Perhaps they assumed Europe’s desperation for Russian gas would expose America’s bluff on sanctions. Or maybe Beijing wanted to study how the West would rally against the invasion of a sovereign nation analogous to Taiwan.

Conceivably, China didn’t have a problem with Russia being embroiled in Eastern Europe and heavily sanctioned by America. Perhaps that’s even what they wanted. But whatever it is, Biden officials are utterly lost.

The Biden administration’s diplomatic efforts failed in the short term. Yet their weakness and incompetence, on full display in Times articles they planted, are the real risk this American security.

China is America’s most formidable adversary. The White House should understand that, but obviously doesn’t. President Biden should hire a staff that isn’t so lost in dealing with Beijing, and that can strike back in more effective ways than leaking stories about their angst toward China to The New York Times.

Kamala Explains It All: ‘Ukraine Is A Country’,"Our very articulate Vice President Kamala Harris wants Americans wondering about the Eastern European conflict dominating news cycles to know that “Ukraine is a country.”

“So Ukraine is a country in Europe,” Harris explained indignantly in a radio interview on Tuesday. “It exists next to another country called Russia.”

When asked by the “Morning Hustle” radio show hosts what to make of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in layman’s terms, Harris dumbed down her explanation of the complex overseas crisis beyond parody.

“Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that’s wrong. And it goes against everything that we stand for,” Harris said.

There it is, folks. The international panic over a conflict that could have been avoided if her administration had taken action months ago, explained in just a few short sentences. I’m sure Putin is quaking in his Kremlin boots right now.

After neglecting her duties as czar for President Joe Biden’s Southern border crisis, Harris recently traveled to Germany to negotiate security for Ukraine’s border as Russia threatened to invade. Harris’s quick trip across the pond implies that her knowledge of the Ukraine situation extends beyond being able to name which continent it’s on, yet, the more the vice president tried to delineate Russia’s motives for invading to U.S. listeners, the less informed she sounded.

“There are terms that we use. We say we respect the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of a country, right, their independence. Russia has gone into Ukraine militarily, unprovoked, with no justification other than to exercise its power to take over another country,” Harris said. “So essentially, that’s what’s at stake and we as America are saying that’s wrong. And we will stand with Ukraine in saying that that is wrong. But that’s essentially where we are. That’s essentially the issue and when it comes to what we know to be principles of fairness, we know that what Russia is doing is wrong.”

“Essentially,” Harris’s weird, robotic analysis proves that the same buffoons who botched the Afghanistan withdrawal and are running our country into the ground have no idea what’s going on in Ukraine and they have no idea how to stop it.

“We threatened sanctions to hopefully deter Russia from going in,” Harris insisted. “So we basically you know, like, if you’re a parent, and you tell your children ‘well, if you do this, the punishment is going to be that,’ right. And we hope that by doing that, it will deter our children from doing the wrong thing, right? So that’s deterrence.”

Harris can preach on any obscure radio show about raining “severe consequences and accountability” on Vladimir Putin in the form of sanctions but the truth is the White House and other Western nations missed their window of opportunity to prevent a war.

Neither the vice president nor the president is the most eloquent or coherent communicator our country has heard but Harris’s recent babblings about Ukraine take the cake. Is this garbled, nonsensical word vomit what we get when our politicians choose people for leadership positions based on their sex and race?

Neocons Want A War With Russia To Regain Control Of The GOP,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought Republican neocons out of the woodwork, agitating for escalation and U.S. military involvement. The same people who brought us the Iraq War and a 20-year occupation of Afghanistan that ended last year in an ignominious and chaotic U.S. withdrawal would now like us to go to war with Russia, a nuclear power, over Ukraine.

Why? Partly because they’re reacting emotionally to the war, which is understandable up to a point. But mostly they would like to leverage a military conflict with Russia to regain control of the Republican Party, whose voters have become deeply disillusioned with foreign interventions — and with the neocons who peddled them to the American people.

Just consider who’s calling for escalation with Russia. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a NeverTrump hack who has spent the last few days posting misinformation about the war on Twitter, over the weekend called for the United States to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

1) The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west. Declare a #NoFlyZone over Ukraine at the invitation of their sovereign govt. Disrupt Russias air ops to give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight. It’s now, or later. — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) February 25, 2022

Somehow, the analysis of people like Kinzinger never gets past the part where we shoot down a Russian MiG-29. But of course a no-fly zone would mean just that: The U.S. would have to shoot down Russian warplanes, and Russian warplanes would very likely do the same to us. We would be in a shooting war with Russia before the no-fly zone was even established.

To his credit, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., flatly rejected the idea, saying, “that would mean World War III.” Even the Biden White House, which rarely misses the chance to fall for a bad idea, dismissed Kinzinger’s insane notion, calling it “not a good idea.”

But it’s not just nobody Republicans like Kinzinger saying this stuff. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., also endorsed the idea of creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine. “Clearly, in the absence of a U.N. resolution, which Russia would veto, a strong coalition of like-minded nations should step in and seriously consider this,” Wicker told HuffPost on Monday. Wicker isn’t some back-bencher. He’ll likely become the next top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee after Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., resigns later this year.

Joining Wicker in this loose talk is former NATO supreme commander and retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, who also called for a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

The no-fly zone isn’t the only terrible idea being bandied about by establishment Republicans and former generals. On Sunday, Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Meet The Press that we should right away bring Ukraine and other countries, like Georgia, into NATO. Bringing Ukraine into NATO, a mutual defense treaty, would of course trigger Article V, which obligates all NATO members to come to the defense of a member that’s under attack. In this case, that would mean — you guessed it — the U.S. going to war with Russia.

That would be the best-case scenario for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the West for arms and aid, and asked NATO to “close the skies.” And while it’s perfectly understandable why Zelensky would want a no-fly zone over his country, or NATO troops to attack Russian forces inside Ukraine, it doesn’t make sense for the U.S. to entertain the idea, or even for U.S. politicians and former generals to talk about it seriously in public.

Unless, that is, these politicians see an opportunity, which some of them no doubt do. If the last five or six years have revealed anything about American politics, it’s that the Republican Party is no longer controlled by the neocon establishment. Donald Trump wrested the party from the neocons, and he did so partly by insisting during the 2016 primaries that the GOP have an honest reckoning about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

No other candidate (besides Sen. Rand Paul) wanted to talk about that, because none of them wanted to criticize George W. Bush or admit that going to war in the Middle East in the vain hope of spreading democracy was in retrospect a horrible idea. But Trump forced the issue, to his credit, and won the nomination partly on that basis. It was something Republican voters wanted and needed; confronting the folly of those wars was the only way to move forward as a party.

But now the neocons are back, if only for a moment, and they’d like you to consider the idea that we shoot down some Russian warplanes, or annex Ukraine into NATO, or do any number of other reckless and provocative things to get us into a war with Russia. Also, they would like to be the ones to lead this effort.

Understand that these aren’t just stupid ideas from small-minded people, it’s part of a larger, desperate bid for relevance, a last-ditch attempt to regain influence in the GOP — influence that these people long ago squandered, and should never get back.

The Russian Collusion Hoax Lives On Through MSNBC,"MSNBC masquerades as the gatekeeper of truth when it comes to disinformation and pledges to purge anyone on the right whom it says fuels false narratives. Radical, regular MSNBC contributors such as Sarah Kendzior, however, get away with promoting debunked conspiracy theories about former President Donald Trump colluding with Russia on air without consequence.

When asked this week to weigh in on the implications of America’s relationship with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Kendzior claimed that Trump was “installed” in the White House in 2016 for the sole purpose of weakening the U.S. response to Vladimir Putin’s power grabs.

“Trump was installed as the president of the United States in order to weaken the alliances that were preventing Putin from achieving his goals,” Kendzior said. “Alliances like NATO, our relationship with our European partners, our relationship with Ukraine. Trump was put in as a bulldozer, and he was put in as a bulldozer to the Constitution, to our system of checks and balances, to our system of institutional trust.”

Sarah Kendzior: ""Trump was installed as the president of the United States in order to weaken the alliances that were preventing Putin from achieving his goals. Alliances like NATO, our relationship with our European partners…with Ukraine."" https://t.co/NNbYfcd8j8 pic.twitter.com/v2NS19oBSS — MSNBC (@MSNBC) February 27, 2022

In addition to insinuating that Trump was not fairly elected, a widespread lie still peddled by Russia collusion hoaxers, Kendzior also claimed that the former president’s presence in the White House spurred on “the unwillingness of people in the United States to confront the brokenness of those institutions, whether through financial corruption in recent years, or age-old systemic problems like the endemic racism that holds our country up.”

MSNBC’s Tiffany Cross, who hosted the segment, didn’t stop to correct her guest. Instead, she also complained that Trump, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Fox News’ Tucker Carlson simply weren’t doing enough to condemn Putin because they are somehow allied with him.

“Tucker Carlson is now conveniently condemning Putin, saying this is his fault. But you can see clearly where he was initially,” Cross noted.

Kendzior, a self-proclaimed “journalist and scholar of authoritarian states,” shows herself to be more of a political hack who profits off of spreading lies about Trump and Russia. She hosts a podcast filled with misinformation clearly debunked by the Mueller report, special counsel John Durham’s findings, and other documents. Yet she still has the audacity to claim with her cohost that “there were all these people freaking out that Trump was a Russian asset, which has been evident for many years.”

More recently, Kendzior ranted without evidence that Republicans have deep ties to Russia and use “literal Kremlin agents” to accomplish their political agenda.

“The Republicans, to be clear, are much worse about this. We’ve gone over this a million times. They had oligarchs at Trump’s inauguration ceremony. They have literal Kremlin agents, like Paul Manafort — who, by the way, everyone should be asking where he is right now, what he’s up to right now — other agents like Michael Flynn, all of these people who are in what I continually call a transnational crime syndicate masquerading as a government. They are so deep into this,” she claimed.

It’s not hard to believe after hearing Kendzior’s crazed conspiracy theories that NeverTrumper and Russia collusion hoaxer Stephen Hayes, who claims he left Fox News last year due to Tucker Carlson’s “Patriot Purge” investigative series, decided to join MSNBC’s parent network NBC.

“Fox News still does real reporting, and there are still responsible conservatives providing valuable opinion and analysis,” Hayes, joined by his Dispatch colleague Jonah Goldberg, wrote. “But the voices of the responsible are being drowned out by the irresponsible.”

Yet the same network that recently featured the left-wing Russia-hoaxer Malcolm Nance, who called for ISIS to bomb a Trump Tower, could now be a regular gig for Hayes who is promoted by NBC News political director and “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd as putting “truth and facts above emotion and sentiment.”

“Truth and facts,” however, aren’t MSNBC’s priority. The leftist network seems to have no qualms with allowing Kendzior or other lying contributors and pundits such as Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid to amplify their false narratives on-air. It is a deeply unserious network that, despite pledging to seek the truth, has a history of doxxing Trump supporters and others who disagree with the corporate outlet’s narratives.

MSNBC has stood by the false narrative that Trump colluded with the Russians to win the presidency in 2016, a reminder that the network is nothing but another corrupt corporate media pawn for Democrats.

Will Kharkiv Be Destroyed In Pursuit Of Putin’s Irredentist Dreams?,"As the sun set on the fifth day of Russia’s offensive war on Ukraine, peace talks started in Belarus. These talks are designed to raise hopes in Ukraine and signal a willingness to talk to the world.

But they are likely a charade, a ruse by ex-KGB officer Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. When the talks “fail,” Putin will likely place the blame for additional destruction on Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

So, what may be next?

Russia’s assault on Kharkiv is intensifying with heavy bombardment. Ukraine’s second-largest city’s outer belt road is only 13 miles from the Russian border. This makes securing the supply lines to the city far easier than routes leading to Kyiv. It also means that artillery and rocket systems bombarding the system can largely be stationed in Russia itself, relatively safe from Ukrainian forces.

More than 1 million people live in Kharkiv. Physically securing the city would result in massive casualties for the largely conscript Russian force—a force that has proven itself poorly led and with low morale. As a result, there is a significant possibility that Putin believes destroying Kharkiv might cow Zelenskyy into surrender.

If the bombardment of Kharkiv continues and features the deployment of large thermobaric bombs, it means Putin is willing to risk the swing of much of world opinion against him, which could, in turn, further damage Russia’s economy and imperil his personal rule.

In the meantime, Russia continues to resupply its forces in the vicinity of Kyiv. This is the main fight. The supposed pause in Kyiv has been linked to talks in Belarus. It’s really due to the ongoing challenge of maintaining supply lines over 60 to 70 miles via secondary roads that run through forests and swamps—roads that may be interdicted by Ukrainian light infantry who were positioned for this purpose.

Russian forces may surround Kyiv while destroying Kharkiv, and then pressure Zelenskyy into accepting terms or else see his capital city reduced to ash.

Some critics of the calculation that the Russian assault on Kyiv has stalled point to the U.S. buildup and capture of Baghdad in 2003. The American and allied assault featured 309,000 personnel supplied from a distant shore fighting 340 miles from Kuwait to Baghdad, about five and a half times the distance from the Chernobyl salient on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border to Kyiv. Opposing them were some 375,000 Iraqi military personnel.

That operation started on March 20, 2003. The government of Saddam Hussain fell on April 9, 20 days later. The big difference is that Hussain’s government had already generated its maximum military power at the moment of the U.S.-led offensive. In Ukraine’s case, the stand of Zelenskyy and his refusal of the U.S. offer to evacuate him, has led to a nation in arms. Ukrainian military power is growing as citizens mobilize.

In the meantime, the Russian Ministry of Defense has suggested that Belarus will join the fight against Ukraine. But President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has increasing public unrest of his own to deal with. And his military is even less well-trained and equipped than the Russian military. Further, the 674-mile-long border between Belarus and Ukraine is defined by the dense Pripyat Marsh, a significant natural obstacle that makes north-south movement difficult.

Lastly, in a significant development, North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations are giving combat aircraft to Ukraine—all of it Soviet-era equipment that the Ukrainians already know how to operate. Most significant among these are Poland’s 27 well-maintained and updated MiG-29s, the same model flown by many Ukrainian pilots. America pledged it will replace these donations with more capable F-16 fighters that these NATO nations are already flying.

The donations of fighter and ground attack aircraft to Ukraine are of a higher profile than donations of ammunition, and shoulder-fired antiaircraft and antitank systems. Russia will likely feel the need to escalate its rhetoric in response to this move.

As this conflict enters its first full week of fighting, it’s important to reflect that Ukrainian resistance has been far fiercer and more effective than most analysts expected—and certainly more than Russia expected. It recalls one of Napoleon’s dictums, “In war, the moral is to the physical as three is to one.”

Ukraine has the moral high ground in this fight. as exemplified by their remarkable, and in many ways, unlikely, President Zelenskyy—a person who shows that one man can make a difference in history.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/01/will-kharkiv-be-destroyed-in-pursuit-of-putins-irredentist-dreams/,2022-03-01
"Without Settlement, History Shows Russia-Ukraine War Will Be Long Slog","Although Russia and Ukraine have captured the world’s attention, it’s hard to get an accurate picture of what exactly is going on. But despite the info ops, elitist jibber-jabber, and declarations that Russia has lost, we can know one thing for sure: This war is nowhere close to being over.

That hasn’t stopped the self-appointed “experts” in foreign policy and media from making sweeping declarations about the outcome, namely that Russia is losing or has already lost, just a few days in.

“Russia has proved unable to secure air superiority over the tiny Ukrainian air force — despite having the second-largest air force in the world, Pentagon officials say. Its troops have yet to take control of any significant city or meaningful chunk of territory, a senior U.S. defense official said Sunday,” The Washington Post announced on Sunday.

Headlines in both The Guardian and The New Republic reinforce the “Russia is losing” message. “With each passing day, it is becoming clearer that Putin’s gamble is failing. The Ukrainian people are resisting with all their heart, winning the admiration of the entire world — and winning the war,” wrote Yuval Noah Harari in the former.

That self-assured narrative pervades Capitol Hill and the Twittersphere as well, with even some foreign policy realists saying Putin has “lost this war.” In essence, it goes that because Russia is substantially bigger and badder than Ukraine, a failure to dominate Kyiv in 72 hours shows that Putin’s regime is floundering.

If recent history gets a word, however, we should know better. Consider the fall of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, a country that today has a population roughly that of Ukraine.

During that conflict some 20 years ago, Iraq was a mess and Baghdad was going up against the United States and Britain, two of the most powerful militaries in the world. We had air superiority, employed weeks of bombardment, and it still took 21 days to take the capital city and another 21 to wrap up our major combat operations.

Meanwhile, Russia’s military strength doesn’t match that of the United States, and Ukraine has a much more legitimate army than Iraq did, complete with top-of-the-line military equipment supplied by the U.S. In other words, Kyiv has a lot more going for it than Baghdad; it should be much harder for Putin to take Ukraine than it was for the U.S. to take Iraq. Yet we’re still more than two weeks out from day 21 of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which won’t be until March 16.

Recent history provides an array of other examples too. In Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War, it took 43 days (Jan. 17 to Feb. 28, 1991) to liberate Kuwait. The invasion of Poland, marking the beginning of World War II, took 35 days (Sept. 1 to Oct. 6, 1939), and the Battle of France the following summer lasted 46 days.

As Research Program Director of Russia Studies at CNA Michael Kofman wrote on Twitter: “[T]his is barely a few days into the war. Ukraine has done remarkably well, but no analysts (except maybe in Moscow) expected Russia to defeat the largest country in Europe within 4 days, especially given UKR military capability.”

Bottom line, he continued, “The bulk of the Russian military has yet to enter the fight,” and “Sadly, I expect the worst is yet ahead, and this war could get a lot more ugly.”

It’s no disrespect to the remarkably brave men and women holding their ground in Ukraine to point out that conclusions about the Russo-Ukrainian war outcome are premature at best — Russia appears to be upping the ante around Kyiv on Tuesday — and historically ignorant at worst. Unless the two countries can negotiate a settlement, history shows the path forward through war will be brutal and long. It certainly won’t be wrapped up in less than a week, nor can it be summed up in a tweet or soundbite based on who might appear to be “losing” at a given moment.

War is messy and complex, and going on network television to say “big guy isn’t immediately dominating small guy” doesn’t a foreign policy expert make. Russia and its aggressive bully tactics very well might fail, but it’s impossible to know this early.

For the last two years, everyone has been a virology expert, and in the past five days, everyone became a foreign policy expert. In our fast-paced mediascape, it can be hard to know what’s true and even harder to pump the brakes. But take a lesson from conflicts past: Five days in, this war is nowhere close to over.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/01/without-a-negotiated-settlement-history-shows-russia-ukraine-war-will-be-a-long-brutal-slog/,2022-03-01
Biden Pledges To Double Down On Energy Policies That Wreck Diplomacy,"President Joe Biden sought to reassure Americans of financial stability in the energy market Tuesday by doubling down on his “green” agenda.

That agenda, which has driven gas prices to seven-year highs, Biden said in his first State of the Union address, features heavy government expenditures on unreliable energy while pushing Americans to buy electric cars.

Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.

Such changes, Biden promised, would “cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change,” while Americans cope with gas prices that remain a dollar higher on average than they were at nearly any point in the Trump administration, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

After antagonizing Americans with high energy prices throughout his tenure with an immediate spike upon Biden’s inaugural moves to suppress domestic oil and gas production, the president pledged in the prime-time address to keep pressure on the industry even as global events demand reclamation of energy independence. The United States is forecast by the EIA to revert to a net-importer of oil despite decades of reserves locked under Biden’s environmental regime even as the administration continues to welcome overseas commodities.

According to the latest data from the EIA, the United States imported more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia, helping the Kremlin finance President Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Revenues from oil and gas, which make up a vast majority of Russian exports, generated $119 billion for Moscow last year, according to numbers reported by Reuters citing its Finance Ministry.

A portion came at the courtesy of the American taxpayer, as the United States doubled is imports of Russian crude while President Biden shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project abandoned by summer. The pipeline transporting crude from the Canadian Tar Sands to gulf refineries carried 830,000 barrels at peak capacity.

American dependence on foreign oil coupled with Europe’s even greater reliance directly on Russian energy supplies has hindered western diplomacy with a nation engaged in an unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine. The only North Atlantic Treaty Organization nation to ban imports of Russian crude since the offensive against Ukraine is Canada, a major producer in its own right that hasn’t imported oil from Russia since 2019.

While sanctions on the Russian energy sector have not been taken off the table, the White House has remained reluctant to target Russia’s oil and gas to avoid even higher prices for consumers.

“We’ll continue to scope out measures to allow for steady energy supplies to global markets,” said a senior administration official on Monday, with the White House ensuring energy transactions remain exempt from sanctions.

The threat of such price spikes however, could have been avoided had the United States maintained its energy independence that the administration forfeited within a year, and the Kremlin’s revenues would have been far lower had oil prices remained lower.

Instead of unleashing American energy production to counteract Russian aggression as a near-term solution, Biden celebrated the coordinated release of oil reserves from emergency stockpiles with international partners.

“Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world,” Biden said on Capitol Hill. “America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve… These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.”

The United States, however, uses an average of 18 million barrels a day, according to the latest estimate from the EIA. That was calculated for 2020, when demand was comparatively low.

Gas prices briefly dipped when the administration tapped the emergency reserves for political purposes ahead of Thanksgiving in November. Prices dropped from $3.48 a gallon the week of Nov. 29, days after Biden ordered 50 million barrels released, to a low of $3.38 by Jan. 3, only to keep soaring. The nation entered March with the highest prices seen since the summer of 2014 with Americans now paying an average $3.70 a gallon.

In his Tuesday night address, Biden made no mention of loosening up on American oil and gas producers after the administration quietly put a halt on new federal land leases for drilling last month.

Also absent from the president’s remarks was any mention of nuclear-generated electricity as a viable long-term alternative to the efficient and low-cost fossil fuels despised by Democrats. While domestic capital- and labor-intensive oil and gas operations would still require time to come online, nuclear generation would take far longer, but could adequately supplement instantaneous power when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.

Germany is the European Union’s most dependent state on Russian gas supplies. It gets a third of its oil and more than half of its gas, and is preparing to reverse course on the decision to phase out nuclear power.

Biden’s promises to maintain hostility to American oil and gas operations came hours after Democrats tanked legislation to designed to counter Russian oil imports and remove barriers to domestic production.

The “American Energy Independence from Russia Act,” which reauthorized the Keystone Pipeline and restarted oil and gas lease sales on federal lands and waters, was rejected by 220 Democrats.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/biden-pledges-to-double-down-on-failing-energy-policies-that-wreck-diplomacy-and-spike-prices/,2022-03-02
"Christians, Let’s Spend More Time In Prayer Than On Twitter","There’s a lot of panicked chatter about World War III lately. Twitter is awash in propaganda from both sides of the Russia-Ukraine border. Instagram is flooded with pro-Ukraine posts and profiles are painted with the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag.

NPR wants to make sure you know, amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, how to self-care. Not to be outdone, Fox also has a primer on how to cope with the stress of news of war.

Many of those reactions aren’t bad. It’s good to celebrate stories of courage and to vocally support peace. It’s also good at times to walk away from the news cycle and be present in your own daily responsibilities.

But there is a real danger to thinking that you, as an American Christian who is not on the ground in Ukraine, can do the most good by getting sucked into the online informational meatgrinder. While there’s certainly nothing wrong with using a post or a hashtag to show support for suffering people, it would be a mistake to use such a contribution to pat ourselves on the back for “helping” — as many well-meaning Christians posted black squares on Instagram in 2020 that did little but alleviate their own sense of wanting to be able to say they did something.

We all have a human desire to be in the know, and to an extent, involved, when crisis strikes. It’s why “if it bleeds, it leads” became a news industry saying and why people gossip. I’ll be the first to admit I’ve seen it in myself this week, and felt convicted for it.

Fellow Christians, have you spent as much time in prayer this week as you have refreshing headlines, sharing viral internet posts, or fretting to your friends about what’s going on in Europe? It’s worth considering.

We are called, as the Apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 6:18, to be “praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.” In Romans, he entreats us to “Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.” Specifically, we are commanded to pray for those in positions of worldly power.

That isn’t to say that, when presented with opportunities to tangibly serve, we should sit on our hands atop our prayer mats. The Bible has plenty to say about faith without works, or being hearers of the word and not doers.

The clear-eyed actions of the church in Ukraine should remind us all to reach for our Bibles before our Twitter feeds. Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of Ukraine’s Greek Catholic Church, announced his plans to bring Mass to citizens huddled in bomb shelters. He was reportedly scheduled to attend a meeting of bishops in Florence but scrapped the trip to stay behind in Kyiv.

“The church will come to the people,” he said. “Our priests will descend to the underground, they will descend to the bomb shelters, and there they will celebrate the Divine Liturgy.”

Other Ukrainian Christians are asking for, along with prayer, more Bibles.

A defining truth of our faith is our security in salvation that does not come from this world, and our peace that is not attainable through geopolitics. We should seek to steward this earthly life in peace, but its lack should not cause our faith to founder. If Ukrainian Christians can stalwartly bear witness of their heavenly hope from bomb shelters, surely American Christians can do our shared faith the credit of not participating in panic.

May our unchanging concentration on our Savior at a time that makes many anxious even be a testimony pointing to his sovereign grace. He has used times of crisis to His glory before.

The second book of Kings recounts the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib, king of Assyria. In response to his taunts and saber-rattling, we’re told, the people of Jerusalem, under the leadership of Hezekiah, “were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s command was, ‘Do not answer him.'” Instead, Hezekiah went to the house of the Lord. The humble prayer he prayed before the Lord’s deliverance remains a worthy template for our own prayers for the protection of the church, in Ukraine and elsewhere.

O Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Lord our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Lord, are God alone.

Democrats Torpedo Legislation Aimed To Reclaim Energy Independence,"House Democrats shot down legislation to reclaim energy independence on Tuesday hours before President Joe Biden offered a rallying cry for his administration’s climate agenda.

The “American Energy Independence from Russia Act” introduced by the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., was rejected primarily along partisan lines 221 to 202. Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz was the sole member of the lower chamber to cross the aisle, joining Democrats in opposition with objections over new leases along his state’s coast.

“America, not Russia, is the world’s number one energy producer,” Rodgers said on the House floor advocating for her legislation. “We should act like it and lead. President Biden must restore American energy dominance and use energy resources to help Ukraine and Europe fight back.”

The bill’s partisan failure comes less than a week after Russia, a global energy producer supplying more than 10 percent of the world’s oil, launched its assault on Ukraine. Last year, the United States doubled its imports of Russian crude and took in more than 400,000 barrels on average daily in December, the last month for which data is available from the Energy Information Administration.

Oil and gas revenues, meanwhile, fund Moscow’s war machine as Russia’s largest exports, allowing President Vladimir Putin to weaponize his country’s monopoly on Western energy. Last year, Russia generated $119 billion from its energy resources, according to reporting by Reuters citing Russia’s Finance Ministry.

The United States must replace Russian energy with American energy independence & accelerating energy exports to our allies.



American strength deters our adversaries, and our response to Putin's unprovoked war against Ukraine demands American leadership. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) February 25, 2022

The United States is forecast by the Energy Department to remain a net importer of oil under Biden as the White House works to suppress domestic production in the name of climate change. Biden reiterated his commitment to phase out fossil fuels with unreliable forms of renewable energy in his prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday night despite driving energy costs to seven-year highs.

The enthusiastic forfeiture of American energy independence has removed a key economic lever to sanction Russia for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which has led to a humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of displaced refugees have fled the violence.

Tuesday’s failed legislation sought to counter Russia’s energy influence and Ukrainian aggression by unleashing American production to lower oil prices and displace Russian imports. The bill reauthorized the Keystone XL Pipeline axed by Biden on his first day in office, which transported more than double the oil imported from Russia in December. The legislation also mandated the resumption of leases for oil and gas drilling on federal land. Biden quietly paused leases again last month through a legal maneuver, contesting rules governing the social cost of carbon calculations.

If it had passed, the Republican bill also would have required the administration to release a plan on energy security within 30 days and replace oil reserves withdrawn from the emergency stockpile. On Tuesday, Biden announced the U.S. would tap 30 million of its 590 million barrels of strategic petroleum reserves maintained for emergencies. The reserves are authorized to hold up to 714 million barrels.

In November, Biden ordered the release of 60 million barrels ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, which is about three days’ worth of daily oil consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/democrats-torpedo-legislation-aimed-to-reclaim-american-energy-independence/,2022-03-02
"Elections Have Consequences, And 2020’s Was War","There is a plethora of misinformation in corporate media on the potential World War III. Shocking, I know. Let’s clear a few things up: Vladimir Putin hasn’t lost. The West did not pull together under Joe Biden’s “leadership.” But Ukraine has most definitely won the propaganda war.

The weakness and incompetence of the Biden administration was irresistible to a tyrant like Putin. That left Ukraine pretty much on its own as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and United States were essentially irrelevant. The Ukrainian forces have exceeded expectations, but thus far Putin has not gone full Golden Horde on them. There is also a lot of smoke and mirrors in play, and as noted information warfare strategists Chuck D and Flavor Flav have advised, “Don’t believe the hype.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is no longer a former comedian, he’s a World War III rock star. When pictures of him in full battle rattle out with the troops were published, apparently the United States offered to whisk him to safety. His response was famously, “I don’t need a ride, I need ammo.”

Add that to the Snake Island defenders telling a Russian warship threatening them to “Go f-ck yourselves” right before the shells started raining down. Then throw in a squad of supermodels carrying Kalashnikovs and 80-year-old guys showing up to fight with a couple of sandwiches and a bad attitude.

That is a tremendous narrative of the plucky patriots fighting for their families and freedom. Those stories are all true, or maybe not. Zelensky is confirmed to have made his request for ammo, but the Snake Island heroes were captured, not killed. The supermodels are at least real on Instagram, and the same with the old guy and his lunch.

At some level, perception is reality, and Ukraine has done a brilliant job of getting its message out. Now they are getting support based on the combination of information warfare and actual battlefield action.

They seem to have stopped the Russian blitzkrieg. Kyiv has not fallen and the Russian advance appears to have stalled. There are also reports of major Russian casualties and destruction of equipment.

But reports are not reality, and it’s worth examining them. Many came from the notoriously reliable interwebz and have run the gamut from unverified to happened seven years ago to absolute B.S.

Information warfare is important in the modern social media battlespace, but it means less than the truth on the ground, which is far from certain. A few pictures of Russian vehicles abandoned by the road can be a sign their logistics aren’t up to snuff. Or show that when 10,000-plus vehicles are rolling through enemy territory, some break down or get ahead of fuel convoys.

Video of Spetsnaz looting food from a store can show their troops are starving. Or it’s a reminder that Spetsnaz are commandos who operate well ahead of the chow wagons in the rear. It is clear that Ukraine was not toppled in a weekend, but that does not mean it couldn’t still be or that was even the goal.

It has been my belief all along that Putin never wanted to own and occupy Ukraine. Assuming he does topple the government, and I think it’s premature to say he couldn’t, then he will face a massive insurgency. He was around for Afghanistan, and I can’t see why he would take that on again.

He does want ownership of the two Russian-speaking provinces on his border with Ukraine in the west and official recognition of Crimea. Making a larger assault gives him bargaining chips to ensure he can trade a promise to not destroy the infrastructure for land deeds and removal of sanctions.

There is talk of peace talks. Also, as if to punctuate his previous threat, Putin put his “defensive” nuclear forces on alert. However, talk is cheap until a deal turns into tanks rolling back to Mother Russia or at least back to the newer additions.

But we can’t ignore that for the first time in decades mass formations of tanks rolled in Europe and the leader of a major power threatened nuclear attack. The damage and danger to Ukraine are huge. The return of nuclear brinksmanship is the real loss for the whole world.

The failure to simply roll into Kyiv as the Russians thought they would is a major blow to their military morale and Putin’s image as the strong man. While the wins for Ukraine are not a bad thing, a wannabe tough guy with wounded pride could be.

Putin now has to salvage something he can call a win and at a minimum now he needs to have Russian vehicles rolling in the streets of Kyiv. Even if he doesn’t topple the regime, that visual may be enough to salve his ego. But that means the gloves are all the way off and civilians are in the crosshairs. There are already credible reports of cluster munitions in built-up areas.

We also must consider that Vlad wants a legacy worthy of his exalted image of himself as a major force in Russian history. Until now, he has done nothing worthy of that. Losing the Ukraine scrap is not an option for him. If it starts looking really bad, his inner megalomaniac may dominate. Making Russia the first country other than the United States to use a nuke in battle would certainly cement his spot in world history.

You would have to go back to the fall of the Soviet Union for the last time there was a real concern that a rogue faction would grab nukes and use them. But this is the rightful(ish) leader threatening to use them against us or anyone else who intervenes. You can’t un-ring that bell.

Neither the United State nor NATO was a serious threat to Putin’s plans, which is a problem. He can do a lot of damage without ever directly encroaching on a NATO country and triggering, theoretically, a response. And while Germany claiming they will spend 100 million euros on their military is a welcome sign, what if they had done so when President Trump pressured them to? Maybe a little peace through strength would have been an actual deterrent.

Now we confront the worst-case scenario of a Dragon/Bear alliance between Russia and China. Xi and Putin met during the Olympics and Xi likely told Vlad. “Just hold off until after the closing ceremonies.” Then they made an energy deal to ensure Vlad had an outlet to replace Nordstream2.

Love him or not, Donald Trump kept Putin, Xi, and even Kim Jong Un from causing major problems. He kept the Russians engaged and far from partnering up with the Communist Chinese. He put all of them on their back feet wondering kind of a deal might be possible but also worried what he might do if they stepped over the line.

Biden can barely be certain what decade this is, let alone present a worthy adversary for these world-class tyrants. They are stealing Joe’s (and the world’s) lunch money while he wonders if today is butterscotch or chocolate pudding.

This was mildly amusing during the campaign, but has gotten progressively more horrifying until now we approach a nuclear showdown. Sadly, the vision of Biden as Slim Pickens riding the nuke like a cowboy in Dr. Strangelove seems an actual possibility.

What happens when Xi decides Taiwan and all its chip factories are perfectly ripe for the picking with no one even marginally competent to be found in the U.S. leadership? One year and one month have led us to the point where World War III is not a joke; it may have already started. That hype you can believe and the only thing we can do is “Fight the Power.”

I don’t mean get ourselves in a war or even a skirmish at this point. We have to fight the woke left’s fundamental transformation of the United States into a toothless, doddering mirror image of Biden they can operate like a puppet. While the left is having a momentary spasm of bellicose fantasy, it is not real and will quickly pass. Their nature is to be subservient, and that is what they want America to be.

We must fight against their view of America as the soy-latte sipping, artisanal arugula-nibbling, one nation among many. That means peace through strength, which just happens to be the best way to avoid getting drawn into anybody’s wars.

But first we need to hope Biden doesn’t somehow throw more gas on this potential nuclear barbecue. Elections have consequences.

Ukrainians Are Winning The Information War,"As the bombardment of Ukraine’s two largest cities intensifies, there’s another aspect of the struggle between Russia and Ukraine that is getting less notice from military analysts fixated on troop numbers and equipment — the moral aspect of war and its interplay with information warfare.

Based on the relatively small force Russian President Vladimir Putin sent charging at Kyiv, he appeared to expect Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to flee and his government to collapse. When Zelenskyy refused President Joe Biden’s offer of evacuation, saying, “I need ammunition, not a ride,” he galvanized the Ukrainian will to resist and inspired much of the world to stand firm against Putin’s war.

These moral factors are impossible to calculate in a conflict, especially at the onset, but they can tip the scales towards victory or defeat as much as bombs and tanks.

On Tuesday morning, Fox News featured a remarkable interview with Taras Tymo, a Ukrainian Catholic University professor. Tymo mentioned that his eldest of five children, a son, had just left home to join the war effort. Tymo then spoke about “civil society.” He said that Putin had destroyed civil society in Russia, like dictators and one-party states like China usually do, as they cannot allow any organization outside of the state.

In America, we too often take civil society for granted. In his “Democracy in America,” Alexis de Tocqueville observed that Americans constantly unite, “…To hold fetes, found seminaries, build inns, construct churches, distribute books, dispatch missionaries to the antipodes. They establish hospitals, prisons, schools by the same method. Finally, if they wish to highlight a truth or develop an opinion by the encouragement of a great example, they form an association.”

Today we see that sort of quintessential American civil society in the ongoing example of Louisiana’s Cajan Navy and its spontaneous response to hurricanes on the Gulf Coast.

As Tymo was talking, the feed switched to scenes of ordinary Ukrainian civilians, mostly women, organizing food and clothing shipments for the war effort. It was organic and heartfelt. Ukrainian civil society was rallying to the nation. Tymo, confident in victory, remarked that not only has Putin destroyed civil society but he has no idea of what it is and what it is capable of.

That Fox News, like most other Western media outlets, can report live on the war a week after the Russia invasion is one reason the world has turned against Putin. Another is the constant stream of videos emerging from Ukraine — some likely staged, most probably not. Ukraine is winning the information war and the Russians are belatedly trying to shut it down. They likely won’t be able to though, as modern communications are increasingly distributed and resilient (see Elon Musk’s donation of Starlink terminals).

Thus, as Putin’s generals have committed some six to eight divisions of troops and support forces totaling approximately 100,000 men, mostly conscripts, with another 100,000 in reserve, Ukraine is mobilizing. With some 7 million people ages 16 to 49 fit for military service, there’s another 4 million available for service in that age range. Many of these will be the defenders of Kyiv.

In this respect, Ukraine is mirroring the historical example of revolutionary France. In the late 1700s through the Napoleonic era, in response to existential threats from the monarchies of Europe, France became a “nation in arms.” While its European enemies were mobilizing small, professional armies, France was able to conscript millions into its military effort. Even after devastating losses, France was able to regenerate its military manpower. Many everyday Frenchmen believed they had a stake in the revolution’s success, even long after Napoleon declared himself emperor.

Similarly, while Putin can commit 200,000 relatively well-equipped soldiers, now that the war has slowed and the nations of the European Union, America, and others are offering increasing amounts of armament and financial aid, Ukraine can overmatch that many times over.

As the Germans approached the gates of Moscow in 1941, the Soviet Union mobilized millions of workers and Communist Party cadres to build trenches around the city and to man militia divisions. These units were not as well-trained or as well-equipped as regular Red Army units, but they had a tremendous will to fight the invader (fortified, as the situation required, by NKVD barrage battalion units that arrested or shot soldiers retreating without orders).

Thus, as the Russians work to encircle Kyiv, that city of almost 3 million people should be able to generate a local defense militia of about 600,000 people. On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy appointed Major General Mykola Zhyrnov to lead the defense of Kyiv, with the city’s elected mayor, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko, maintaining responsibility for civil aspects of defense.

If the Russians are to effectively encircle the city, they will need to create a double ring line, with troops facing inward to besiege the city, and facing outward to guard against likely avenues from which a Ukrainian counterattack to relieve the city may develop. To do that, Russia may have to finish its fight in the east against Sumy and Kharkiv. After which, they may bring those forces west to join the effort at Kyiv — that or insert another 30,000 troops down from the Chernobyl salient on the border with Belarus through the highly-congested main supply route. That’s a two-lane country road that emerges from the Pripyat Marsh some 60 miles north of the city — a route vulnerable to interdiction.

The contest in Ukraine threatens to enter a far more deadly phase as Russia seeks to break the will of the defenders using massed fires, while Ukraine continues to mobilize its people into a cohesive defense.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/ukrainians-are-winning-the-information-war/,2022-03-02
We've Got Three More Years Of Biden Making The World More Dangerous,"Fifty years ago this week, President Nixon signed the Shanghai Communique with the People’s Republic of China. It was a bold act of statecraft that helped drive a wedge between Communist China and the Soviet Union.

For most of the Cold War, the United States had a clear and guiding mission: defeat the Soviet Union and communism, divide our enemies, and protect our allies. Today, the enemies of the United States have taken on the reverse mission: defeat Western democracy, divide the United States and her allies, and protect autocracies.

The Sino-Russian alliance and the regimes they prop up from Caracas to Tehran form a dangerously formidable opponent. It is vital that our elected leaders meet that challenge. Sadly, they are far from meeting that task.

As a candidate for president, Joe Biden promised he would mend our supposedly broken alliances, “bring the adults back in charge,” stand up to Russia by arming Ukraine, and make America more prosperous. Across all these accounts, he has failed.

Biden has isolated our allies and partners in the Middle East so badly they would not even vote with us at the United Nations to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His administration repeatedly blocked and stalled military assistance to Ukraine, and only promised Stinger missiles to them last week after dovish countries like Germany and the Netherlands had already committed them as well. Inflation is higher than it’s been in 40 years and gas prices are on the rise even further.

Biden Sacrifices America For Climate Change

As my former boss, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has stated many times, each administration governs with guiding principles for its foreign policy. For the Trump administration, it was America First. This is the lens through which we viewed all foreign policy decisions: what was best for the American people?

It led to enormous and transformative victories around the world: four peace deals brokered in the Middle East with the Abraham Accords. The world’s most deadly terrorists, ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Qassem Soleimani, were taken off the battlefield forever. Our diplomatic pressure campaign against the Chinese Communist Party’s covert 5G espionage program, Huawei, reduced that threat.

For President Biden, however, his foundation is climate change and the supposed restoration of American standing in the world. That has led to a first-year track record on national security that is nothing less than abysmal. Because of repeated capitulations across the world, our enemies no longer fear us — a catastrophic development made evident by revelations that Iran is daring to plot kidnapping and assassination plots against American citizens on our own soil.

Biden’s Foreign Policy Failures

Within four months of Biden taking office, Hamas was attacking Israel; after seven months, Kabul fell to the Taliban; and within 13 months, we have the first major ground war in Europe since 1945. Today, we are on the brink of losing our democratic partner, Ukraine, to a power-hungry dictator.

The Biden administration’s strategy to prevent the war from taking place was laughable. Their approach relied on scaring Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin with the threat of undisclosed sanctions when Biden had already folded on Nord Stream 2 and New START, and had failed to respond to the Russian hack of the Colonial Pipeline. Biden sought to deter Russia from invading and failed. Now Canada and the Europeans are picking up the slack — who would have guessed we’d be taking cues from them?

These are just a sampling of the failings we’ve seen in Biden’s first year. Without a fundamental change, what do the next three years look like? We could see China mount a deadly invasion of Taiwan. North Korea could use nuclear extortion to change the status quo on the Korean peninsula. Iran could cross the nuclear threshold and hold the Middle East and Israel hostage to its threats. Our top generals have already warned that Al-Qaeda and ISIS are likely to regain their ability to strike outside of Afghanistan in the coming months.

Putin will be listed in history next to other evil men, from Adolf Hitler to Mao Zedong to Joseph Stalin. He only respects the language of power, and he is fluent in every form of deception. But President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were naive enough to believe that Putin could be dissuaded solely through rhetoric and the weak threat of sanctions.

Importantly, they lack a critical skill in national security officials: the ability to understand, predict, and disrupt the devious plots of our enemies. Just two weeks ago, Blinken repeatedly lamented that he “did not understand” why Putin would attack Ukraine when he could work on combatting climate change instead. Read that again: our own secretary of state admitted he can’t understand how our adversaries think.

Misguided Ideology

The mounting disasters are not just a coincidence or bad luck — they are a direct consequence of individuals who believe misguided ideologies that oppose American exceptionalism, American power, and the fact that America has been the greatest source for peace and prosperity in the history of the world. When you can’t stand up for America at home, you will never stand up for her abroad.

We’re in a new era of hard power where autocrats don’t care if we post pictures of solidarity or hashtags for days on Twitter. Biden and his team need to get serious. Only strength will deter these regimes, which is why it is so vital we continue the task of rebuilding our military strength and nuclear abilities.

Here’s a scary fact: the United States has not designed or built a new nuclear warhead since the end of the Cold War, and we no longer have the infrastructure to create new nuclear weapons. The average age of the nuclear warheads in our stockpile is over 25 years — older than most of the soldiers tasked with operating the weapons.

Today, China has the world’s largest standing ground forces, the largest navy and coast guard, the largest sub-strategic missile force, and the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific. Russia has been serially cheating on its nuclear treaty obligations, under which China isn’t even constrained. Despite such rising threats, Biden’s defense budget request for this year was the equivalent of a 5 percent cut after accounting for inflation. How is the United States supposed to deter Russia and China when our leaders apply the disastrous logic of “defund the police” to our military?

Despite Biden’s repeated failings, he has doubled down on the ideology and outlook that led us to the abdication of American power. He has not evaluated his failings and changed course. His next major blunder may be if he inks a proposed nuclear deal with Iran that would provide the regime a rapid path to a nuclear weapon and $90 billion in no-strings-attached sanctions relief.

Change of Course Urgently Needed

Biden needs to change course and can only do so through new leadership in his national security team. But there have been no firings — except of an Army colonel who dared speak out about the failed approach in Afghanistan.

Recently, a top State Department diplomat working on Iran negotiations was pushed out for disagreeing with the pending capitulation to the regime’s nuclear extortion in Vienna. Biden needs to stop the leadership decay in his administration — and he’s got to stop listening to the naïve lackeys who are pushing the few good men out.

One of the greatest differences between democracies like the United States and autocracies like Putin’s Russia is that our elected officials are supposed to serve the people, not the other way around. We evaluate our leaders by their results and hold them accountable when they can’t perform.

By any measure, Biden and his top foreign policy officials have failed the American people. They should resign their offices. If they do not, the American people must vote them out. That starts this November by electing new leaders to Congress who will hold the Biden administration accountable and restore American leadership and strength.

Fear Of Donald Trump Kept Putin From Invading Ukraine. Here’s How Trump Pulled It Off,"A recent Harvard-Harris poll found that 62 percent of Americans believe that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Donald Trump were still in the Oval Office. As former senior intelligence officials under President Trump, we agree with that view.

Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 when George W. Bush was president. Russia took Crimea in 2014 when Barack Obama was president. Russia has now invaded Ukraine with Joe Biden as president. However, when Donald Trump was president, Russia did not seize territory from any of its neighbors.

During his four years in office, Trump not only successfully deterred Russia from acting against Ukraine, he effectively deterred a lot of bad behavior across the planet. He focused on ending America’s foreign wars rather than launching new ones. At the same time, he brokered the Abraham Accords to expand peace in the Middle East.

The exercise of American power to deter adversaries is a complicated business. It involves a mix of military, economic, political, and diplomatic strategies and actions that together communicate the costs of threatening U.S. national interests.

Ultimately, the art of statecraft boils down to whether a president projects American strength that deters adversaries, or projects American weakness that emboldens our adversaries.

So how did Trump succeed in containing Putin while the Russian autocrat has run wild with others in the White House? Why was he so successful at spreading peace elsewhere? We believe the long answer begins with these ten ways that Donald Trump projected American strength and kept the bad guys in check:

Rebuilt the American Military Crusaded for American Energy Dominance Set the Tone by Launching Surgical Missile Strikes in Syria in Early 2017 Developed Strong Relationships with Middle Eastern Nations Based on Mutual Interests Was Ruthless with the Taliban While Winding Down the Afghanistan War Crushed the ISIS Caliphate Demonstrated a Consistent Willingness to Take out the Bad Guys Stood Up to China Strategically Used Unpredictability as an Asset in Foreign Affairs Advanced Tough Russia Policies and Provided Lethal Aid to Ukraine while Maintaining an Open Dialogue

Each of these points are worthy of unpacking in-depth, but there are several that illustrate the dramatic difference in approach between Trump and Biden, starting with Afghanistan.

When President Trump initiated the process of ending America’s longest war, senior officials huddled in the Situation Room to discuss tactical challenges on the ground. The president reminded the group of America’s humiliating withdrawal from Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War, and said we must do whatever it takes to leave in a safe, orderly, and dignified way. When military leaders bemoaned the costs and logistical challenges of bringing home our equipment, the president said that he did not care if it was a helicopter or a styrofoam cooler. If it had an American flag on it, it was either coming home or getting destroyed to keep it from falling into the hands of our enemies. He vowed that we would leave on our terms, or we would not leave at all.

Tragically, President Biden’s approach – which included the decision to abandon the strategically important Bagram Air Base prior to the evacuation – cost the lives of 13 American servicemembers and led to the Taliban parading victoriously through Kabul with billions of dollars of American combat equipment. The administration’s stunning incompetence – detailed in an official U.S. Army report – made the United States look weak and vulnerable on the world stage, and Putin was watching.

The world took notice when Trump ordered the killing of Iranian terrorist general Qassem Soleimani, who had operated with impunity throughout the Middle East until the U.S. military sent two Hellfire missiles through his vehicle. As a candidate for president, Biden released a statement condemning the righteous attack as a “hugely escalatory move” that brought us to “the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.” This, of course, proved to not be the case, but it illustrated Biden’s unwillingness to do what it takes to establish credible deterrence.

This principle of deterrence applies across the globe, which explains why the Chinese military has sent a record number of airplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone since Biden took office.

To the specific case at hand, Trump was much tougher on Russia than the media have led people to believe, while Biden has been far softer.

Trump deployed such aggressive sanctions against Russia that President Obama’s Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called them the toughest in history, and he withdrew from one-sided treaties that hamstrung the U.S. while Russia violated the terms.

Biden has taken the opposite approach, appeasing Putin by handing him his top two geopolitical priorities on a silver platter. He unconditionally extended the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, allowing Russia to continue building tactical nuclear weapons while constraining our ability to modernize. And while Trump imposed sanctions to stop Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline in its tracks, construction was allowed to resume when Biden took office.

President Trump understood the power of building American energy dominance. By slashing onerous regulations, Trump sparked an American energy boom that ensured we would never be reliant on any other nation to meet our energy needs. Geopolitically, America’s increased export capacity reduced Putin’s leverage over our European allies, who depend on Russia for 40 percent of their gas and more than a quarter of their oil.

Trump approved the Keystone XL oil pipeline at home and shut down Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Eastern Europe. Biden reversed both decisions, meaning he has been harder on America’s energy producers than he has been on Russia’s. To add insult to injury, as the Russian army pushed into Ukraine, Biden’s climate envoy John Kerry hoped aloud that “President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.”

Vladimir Putin’s appetite for expansion did not wane during the four years Trump was in office, and the world was not just miraculously a safer place. Bad actors like Putin simply knew that they had to restrain themselves or deal with the consequences. In nearly every way possible, President Biden has weakened the United States and our allies and empowered Putin. As a result, Russia is on the march, even as the Ukrainian people have inspired the world with their courage and resilience. And in the wings, America’s greatest threat – Xi Jinping’s China – waits, and watches.

Russian 'Tanks' Outside Kyiv Are Probably Not What You Think They Are,"One of the most consistently fun, annoying, and frustrating things about being a retired military intelligence officer is how frequently random military vehicles get called “tanks.” Look, I know, tanks are kind of cool, I get it; I spent a lot of time in them in my career, starting with this vintage M60A1 at Ft. Bliss, Texas. But not everything painted with camouflage that can move is a main battle tank.

So, what are we seeing north of Kyiv that the media has been fixated on for the last several days? What does it mean? Is it a harbinger of the expected siege and fall of Kyiv — 1,000 tanks and artillery pieces? Or is it something else?

You can tell much about the point of view of the reporter covering this column of vehicles by the degree of alarm accorded it. But the satellite photos, called overhead imagery by intelligence fossils like myself, released by Maxar Technologies show mostly trucks with some local security.

That they’ve been on the road now for as long as four days tells a lot about the operation they are supporting, the terrain, and the leadership and training of the force.

When an intelligence officer regards the terrain on which he is to provide advice to his commander, he conducts a thorough analysis, looking that the size and quality of roads, the capabilities of bridges, chokepoints, and the corridors in which combat vehicles can tactically maneuver.

The roughly 80-mile route from the Belarus-Ukraine border from the Chernobyl salient to Kyiv on the western side of the Dnieper River runs over a secondary asphalt road. This road frequently crosses rivers, runs through small villages, or is bordered on both sides by the eastern extent of the mighty Pripyat Marsh — the geographical feature which defines the border between Ukraine and Belarus.

The road is not able to support a large military force, even if unopposed in an exercise, especially during the spring and fall months during a time the locals call “Rasputitsa” — the mud season. Unfortunately for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his military commanders, Ukrainian soil never froze solid this winter, so the fall Rasputitsa is still a factor.

This is why there have been so many photos coming out from the conflict that show all manner of Russian military vehicles bogged down in the mud. As soon as a vehicle on a narrow road becomes disabled or is destroyed in combat, or as the vehicles maneuver off-road in response to combat, they risk becoming mired. Even if they don’t get stuck in the mud, they end up consuming far more fuel that must be delivered to them than they would were the ground frozen solid.

Thus, that 40-mile-long column of “tanks” is more likely mostly trucks carrying fuel, ammunition, and food to the advanced forces of the Russian 20th Combined Arms Army on the outskirts of Kyiv. That this column hasn’t apparently moved much may mean that the Russian forces just north of Kyiv are running low on basic supplies.

This greatly increases the importance for the Russian army to achieve success to the east of Kyiv where the road network is far more developed and, if the terrain is captured and secured, capable of bringing in the volume of supplies needed to properly surround Kyiv and place it under siege.

In the meantime, the forces near Kyiv may be vulnerable to a Ukrainian counterattack. While some of the Russian conscript soldiers and even the veteran contract troops may be more likely to surrender due to low morale exacerbated by a lack of food and fuel.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/03/satellite-images-of-russian-tanks-outside-kyiv-are-probably-not-what-you-think-they-are/,2022-03-03
"For The Sake Of National Security, We Must Open Alaskan Drilling","While Americans brace for an even tighter gas crunch, four decades of recoverable reserves remain locked under environmental regulation Democrats have sought to make permanent.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, between 4 to 12 billion barrels of oil are buried under the northern tundra of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) waiting to be tapped 60 miles from critical infrastructure already in place for mass production at Prudhoe Bay.

“The theory at ANWR is that these reservoirs are massive and that type of formation is something that is rare in on-shore operations,” said President Donald Trump’s former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who oversaw the first lease sales within the 1002 area opened for drilling by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Industry innovation since the Geological Survey’s 1998 analysis has likely enhanced the amount that can be recovered, extending the estimate from more than 20 years ago.

“Today with technology, there’s the possibility there’s much more that can be technologically recovered in terms of volume and that I think is a very big reality if you look at what’s happened in other areas,” Bernhardt told The Federalist.

Political boundaries drawn by Washington bureaucrats, however, have barred American workers from harvesting the area’s rich resources in the name of climate change and environmental justice. The same politicians have enthusiastically embraced Russian oil imports that are now financing the Kremlin’s war machine lobbing bombs in Ukraine.

Last week, the Department of Energy released its trade data for December, showing the United States more than doubled its imports on Russian supply with 245 million barrels of crude oil and related petroleum products brought to the American consumer for an average of nearly 672,000 barrels per day. At the same time, President Joe Biden escalated the administration’s war on domestic production.

Biden illegally suspended drilling leases on federal lands, imposed sanctions on the Keystone XL Pipeline, and outright banned all exploration activity within the boundaries of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Even as Moscow prepared its invasion of Ukraine, clearly foreshadowing further strain on energy markets, Biden’s Justice Department reinstated the administration’s suspension of oil and gas leases with a legal filing in Louisiana.

The United States is now forecast by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to be a net importer of oil after the nation broke its dependence on foreign supply as a net exporter for the first time in more than 70 years under President Trump in 2018.

“America’s energy production creates a massive strength for the president’s foreign policy vision,” said Bernhardt, also a former official in the Bush administration, highlighting how he observed Trump’s calculus was free of the kind of restraints George W. Bush faced while presiding over a nation dependent on overseas sources. “President [Trump] had the benefit of utilizing liquified natural gas (LNG) exports, thinking through opportunities relevant to the Middle East with the knowledge that we had a stronger and more stable energy production system in the United States.”

LNG exports allow the United States to supplement supply from Russian sources and eclipsed Moscow’s pipeline deliveries to Europe for the first time in January. But with American LNG export terminals already operating at above capacity to meet overseas demand, new facilities are required. Democrats, however, have refused to capitulate.

The enthusiastic forfeiture of American energy independence, or really energy dominance, has limited the Biden administration’s diplomatic menu for countering Russian aggression. So far, the administration has refused to significantly target Russia’s energy sector and even made a point to exempt industry-related transactions from current sanctions for fear of further harming the market.

“We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,” said Biden’s Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Air Force One Wednesday. Sanctioning Russian oil she said, “would raise prices at the gas pump for Americans.”

Such increased price spikes as Americans cope with seven-year highs wouldn’t be a concern had the administration not hindered U.S. capacity to make up the difference.

Despite the absence of American sanctions, private entities have already self-restricted with refusal to purchase Russian crude, roping off the world’s third-largest oil producer which provides more than 10 percent of global supply.

“We’re going to pay for closing down Russian imports, but we don’t have to,” Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, told The Federalist. “When there’s plenty of oil flowing, in other words when the United States was in the ball game, spare capacity was high.”

When global turmoil rocked the Middle East, Pyle added, “they didn’t result in a blip in oil prices because we knew that we could make it up elsewhere, that’s the difference.”

President Vladimir Putin’s regime is funded primarily by its lucrative oil and gas revenues as a majority of its exports. As the United States joined Europe to ramp up its dependence on Russian imports last year, the Kremlin generated $119 billion from its resources, a third of its entire budget, according to reporting by Reuters citing Russia’s Finance Ministry.

The regime also exploited its abundant oil and gas reserves to tie western supply to Moscow’s resources allowing Putin to weaponize Russian energy. Russia doubled its production of nuclear-generated electricity to allow it to trade away its oil and gas to foreign nations, and funded climate activists in western nations to protest domestic shale operations.

In 2014, NATO's secretary general revealed Russia was funding climate activists, saying, “Russia… engaged actively with so-called nongovernmental organizations working against shale gas to maintain dependence on imported Russian gas""



Nobody listened.https://t.co/JJtn2hLNjB — Michael Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) March 3, 2022

The United States has been no exception to Putin’s preemptive energy strategy as it imports Russian oil while shutting down operations at home.

It’s not just the less than 10 percent portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge once opened for extraction in part of the country protected by lower 48 elites. The Biden administration also scrapped more leases in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve as the White House continued to knee-cap domestic production.

The federal government’s antagonism against Alaskan producers has frustrated the state’s Republican governor, who blasted the White House’s relentless regulation from 4,000 miles away after Biden pledged to double down on his disastrous energy policy in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech.

“Alaska has billions of barrels of oil and trillions of feet of natural gas, and we produce it cleaner than virtually any other place on the planet,” Dunleavy said in a press release. “It’s time to restore the suspended oil leases on ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). It’s time to support, not hinder in federal court, the Willow project so that in a few years, some 160,000 barrels of oil a day can increase the throughput in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, adding to our national energy resources.”

Yet President Biden is unlikely to reverse course. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said promoting domestic production in light of the crisis in Ukraine would take too long.

“What this is all a reminder of in the president’s view, is the need to reduce our reliance on oil,” Psaki told reporters.

Jen Psaki says it would take too long to build Keystone XL and that America should instead invest in clean energy and reduce our reliance on oil.

It’s true oil and gas operations don’t come online at the flip of a switch and take time as a capital- and labor-intensive industry to produce. Pyle said an administration reversing course on its cascade of anti-industry regulation, however, would push operators to ramp up production.

“If Biden announced today he’s reversing opposition and allowing the permit for Keystone, would oil come to the market tomorrow? No,” Pyle told The Federalist. “But the market will respond because it gets the message the United States is open for business.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/for-the-sake-of-national-security-we-must-reopen-the-alaska-national-wildlife-refuge/,2022-03-04
"If The West Won't Stop Putin By Force, It Should Help Negotiate Peace","As the Russian invasion of Ukraine stretches into its second week, and Moscow’s tactics shift to the direct targeting of urban centers and civilian populations, the United States and our European allies are facing tough questions about how much assistance to give the Ukrainians without becoming belligerents — or being considered belligerents by Russia — and thus widening the war.

As I write, Russian forces are laying siege to cities across Ukraine, contesting vital ports, and targeting civilians and critical infrastructure. The bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, has left at least dozens dead and hundreds more injured. Russian troops are now in control of Kherson, a major city in the south. The southern port city of Mariupol has been encircled, and the Russian attack there has cut power, water, and heat. Kyiv is under attack, and there are reports that Russia is preparing a major amphibious assault on Odessa.

Meanwhile, our leaders appear to be living in a fantasyland where their expressions of solidarity with Ukraine mean something tangible. Economic sanctions, the banning of Russian products from store shelves, the exclusion of Russian cats from cat shows, and the seizure of mega-yachts owned by Russian oligarchs, among other weak and inchoate responses from the West, are not going to stop Russian artillery and missiles from reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble in the coming days and weeks. The Ukrainians have fought bravely and inspired the world with their valor, but a new phase of the war is beginning, and Western leaders need to think seriously about what’s coming, and how this will end.

To stop the Russian invasion, the Ukrainians need more from the West than economic sanctions and bans on Russian products. They need heavy weapons, munitions, air support, and real-time intelligence from Western powers, and they need these things right now. The NATO allies understand this, on some level, and are pouring weapons into Ukraine — rocket launchers, Javelin antitank missiles, Stinger surface-to-air missiles, along with machine guns, sniper rifles, and ammunition.

But they are not sending military aircraft, and they are not sending troops. The United States will not even impose sanctions on Russian oil or entertain the idea of ramping up domestic oil production to offset Russian imports. A White House flack told reporters aboard Air Force One this week: “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.” So that’s that.

The West, it seems, is trying to go right up to the line of belligerence without crossing it. Helping Ukraine, but not helping too much. For example, it appears that the U.S. is sharing some targeting intelligence with Ukraine but not real-time targeting of the kind that would enable Ukraine to take out individual Russian units.

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who said Thursday morning on MSNBC that “we are providing some intelligence” to Ukraine, also said that real-time targeting would cross a line “to marking us participating in the war.” Hours later, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki implied that we were not giving any targeting intelligence to Ukraine, which prompted pushback from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who called Psaki’s comments “truthy” and that they do not “capture the full reality.”

Most likely, we are indeed providing targeting intelligence to Ukraine, but giving them the information only after a delay, so Russia cannot accuse us of assisting in the direct targeting of their forces.

That’s just one example of the needle Western powers are trying to thread. As the war goes on, and the fighting intensifies in and around Ukraine’s urban centers, the eye of that needle, so to speak, will get smaller and smaller. That means our leaders need to get serious about what they are prepared to do, and not do, in the defense of Ukraine. And they need to be clear with Ukraine and Russia about their intentions.

Right now, there is a galling lack of seriousness and clarity among them. On Thursday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., took to Twitter to call for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as if that’s a realistic option to end the crisis and avert catastrophe in Ukraine.

Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?



The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out.



You would be doing your country – and the world – a great service. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) March 4, 2022

His comment follows other reckless comments in recent days from U.S. lawmakers and former generals calling for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. A no-fly zone would mean NATO warplanes shooting down Russian warplanes. It would mean open war with Russia. That’s precisely what some neocons in Washington want, for reasons of their own, but it’s not something the vast majority of Americans want.

Here is the hard truth: If the West is not going to send warplanes and troops, if we are not going to stop Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by force of arms, and by our inaction allow the bombardment of Ukrainian cities to proceed, then we need to be honest with the Ukrainians about that. We owe it to them to give them a realistic picture of what they can expect from us, and what they cannot expect. Indeed, we owe them a great deal more, but we at least owe them that.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is understandably trying to get NATO involved in the war. He is doing what any leader should do in his position, and he will likely go down in history for his courage and bravery in the face of the enemy. But if there is an off-ramp that might prevent what now appears to be the inevitable reduction of Ukraine to rubble, then Western leaders should not block it with bellicose talk and weak half-measures. We have had quite enough of both. Indeed, there were opportunities for the West to prevent this war, to persuade Moscow and Kyiv to negotiate a settlement, going back years. But in our fecklessness, we chose not to and instead kept talking tough and hoping for the best.

Now that Russia has entered this new phase of the war, the worst thing we could do for the Ukrainians would be to give them false hope as Russian forces close in, and then do nothing while their cities burn. If we will not do what’s necessary to stop Russia by force, then we should do what we can, right now, to broker a negotiated peace.

NATO Intervention In Ukraine Could Spark Nuclear War. Here's How,"“How did we just kill a billion people?”

Over just three days, as I have done countless times over the last several years, a group of past and present senior U.S. government officials from both sides of the aisle gathered to wage a NATO-Russia war in a simulation at the end of 2019. In the course of what we called the NATO-Russia War of 2019, we estimated one billion people died. And if we aren’t careful, what happened in a simulation could happen if a NATO-Russia war erupts over Ukraine.

In fact, in the simulation I mentioned above from 2019, in which Russia invades Ukraine in a similar way as it did over the last week or so, not only does NATO get sucked in unintentionally, but Russia eventually releases nuclear weapons in its desperation. The result is an eventual escalation of bigger and more dangerous nuclear weapons whereby over one billion lives are lost.

But before we start staring into the abyss, allow me to explain the goal of such simulations. NATO clearly would have a massive conventional advantage in any war with Moscow, ensuring that in a straight-up fight Putin would lose. However, Russia has stated time and time again it will use nuclear weapons to defend its territory and its regime if it feels mortally threatened. Our simulation always seems to ask: Can we ever defeat Russian President Vladamir Putin in an armed conflict over Ukraine or the Baltics and not start a nuclear war in the process?

So far, over at least several years, and with at least 100 different participants that all held different ideas about war and political allegiances, the answer is a flat out no.

Setting the Scene for War

The scenario the group decided to test back in late 2019 was similar to today: Russia decided to invade Ukraine under the excuse that it is must defend Russian-speaking peoples that are being “oppressed” by Ukraine’s fascist government. In our scenario, we assumed Russia performs far more admirably than it does today but has more limited objectives, in that Moscow wants to connect Crimea to separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine that are under its effective control. We assumed that Russia does that quickly, achieving most of its military objectives in roughly four days.

But Ukraine does not give up so easily, just like in real life today. Ukrainian forces, after taking heavy losses, mount an impressive counterattack, whereby Russia loses over 100 tanks and over 2,500 soldiers. Images on social media show Russian armor ablaze, elite Su-35 fighter jets are shut down from the skies, and arms are now flowing in from the West in massive numbers.

Putin is outraged. He thought Ukraine would simply roll over, but he does not factor into his calculus the nearly decades-long training Kyiv received from the U.S. and NATO nor Ukraine’s military build-up for the last several years that was focused on this scenario.

Russia then decides that its limited military objectives were a mistake, and that all of Ukraine must be “demilitarized.” Moscow then launches a massive ballistic and cruise missile strike followed up by Russia’s air force launching its own shock and awe campaign, destroying a vast majority of Ukraine’s command and control structure, air force, air defense, and armored units in the process. At the same time, Russia starts surging troops to the borders of Ukraine in what looks like an imminent general invasion and occupation of the entire country.

The Spark

Here is where things take a turn for the worst. A Russian ballistic missile’s guidance system fails and crash-lands into NATO member Poland, killing 34 civilians as it tragically lands into a populated village along the Polish-Ukraine border. While the missile was not directed at Poland intentionally, pictures on social media show children crying for their mothers and bodies left unrecognizable, and demands for justice and revenge mount.

To its credit, Poland, which has its own tortured history with the Soviet Union and Russia, does its best to show restraint. While not responding with its own military, it leads an effort to see that Moscow pays a steep price for its aggression in Ukraine and actions, even unintentional, in Poland. Warsaw leads a diplomatic and economic boycott of Moscow resulting in Russia being kicked out of SWIFT as well as direct sanctions on Russian banks, similar to what we are seeing today.

In our scenario, Russia’s reaction is also swift. Moscow decides to launch a massive cyber attack on Poland, having based cyber warriors all throughout NATO territory, using their geography and proxy servers to mask the origin of the attack. Russia, in just two hours, takes off-line Poland’s entire electrical grid, banking sector, energy plants, and more — essentially taking Poland back to the stone age.

And this is where the nightmare begins. Even though attribution is hard to achieve, Poland appeals to NATO and starts to privately share its desire to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter, declaring that an attack on one is an attack on the entire alliance. NATO is worried, as there is debate on how far to punish Russia while also feeling as if they do not have a clear military objective amongst the member states as some want to respond to what happened to Poland while others feel they must intervene militarily in Ukraine.

The Response

Here is where NATO surprises everyone. The alliance decides to set up a limited no-fly zone around the Ukrainian city of Lviv to protect innocent civilians and refugees that are trapped and have nowhere to go. Russia is warned: NATO is not intervening in the conflict, but will ensure that its planes and the airspace around Lviv are protected. NATO does make clear its jets will be in the skies above Ukraine, but will not operate from Ukrainian territory.

In Moscow, Putin now gets a sense that NATO is destined to intervene on Ukraine’s side. Russia fears NATO will use this protected corridor as a base of operations to send ever more sophisticated weapons. And with its economy now in a tailspin due to sanctions, Putin feels the walls closing in him. Before NATO can impose its no-fly zone, Putin orders strikes on any remaining airfields and military assets around Lviv.

But here is where Putin miscalculates and sets the stage for a NATO-Russia war. Putin orders another massive cyber attack on the Baltic states’ military infrastructure, thinking that NATO will use the Baltics to stage an invasion of Russia.

This ends up being the last straw for NATO, which then decides direct intervention in Ukraine is necessary to push back against Russian aggression. Before even an announcement is made, Russian intelligence sees missile and troop movements that indicate an impending NATO attack and decide to strike first — with tactical nuclear weapons. NATO decides to respond in kind.

Russia then targets European cities with nuclear weapons, with NATO and America also responding in kind. What is left is nothing short of an apocalypse, with what we estimate is billion people dead.

No War Goes As Planned

In every scenario I have been a part of there is one common theme to all of them: When Vladimir Putin feels boxed in and feels Russia is directly threatened, usually from a mistake he makes on the battlefield, he decides to use whatever escalatory step he desires to try and make up for it.

While we may well soon see Ukraine and Russia find a diplomatic path out of this brutal war, both sides seem dug in. That means the chances for escalation like the above are high. And if Russia and NATO do become involved in direct conflict, Putin knows that in a conventional fight his regime would be defeated. That means Russia will choose nuclear war.

The only question in a NATO-Russia war seems obvious: how many millions or billions of people would die?

Ukrainians Rebound In Northwest Battle Of Bucha,"Listening to news reports on Russia’s war on Ukraine, whether hard news or punditry, can be depressing — endless images of urban destruction and reports of advancing Russian forces.

Yet, it is not foreordained that Russia wins and Ukraine loses. Winning a war is not merely an exercise in numbers or technology. As General George S. Patton observed, “Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory.”

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to quickly topple the Ukrainian government and kill President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the war has widened into a contest involving almost the entire border region shared by the combatants along with the stretch of border between Belarus and Kyiv some 80 miles to the north of Ukraine’s capital city.

Much media attention has been given to Russia’s advances along the Sea of Azov in the south and on the approach to Ukraine’s third-largest city, Odessa, on the shores of the Black Sea as well as the remarkable attack that captured Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. These Russian successes are discouraging for Ukrainian defenders but, in the grand contest, they matter far less than the battle for Kyiv.

In the Eighteenth Century, Frederick the Great, noted: “He who defends everything, defends nothing.” In this context, Ukraine’s task is simple — not easy — but simple. It must keep a viable government, preferably in the capital city of Kyiv. To do that, Ukraine must maintain its supply lines to Poland in the west with the city of Lviv being the key transportation hub in the west. As long as Kyiv, Lviv, and the roads between them remain in Ukrainian hands, the fight can continue. As long as the fight continues, the economic pressure of Russia mounts, making it increasingly difficult to sustain both the fight and Putin’s hold on power. Thus, losses in the south are regrettable, but they are not fatal to Ukraine’s cause.

In that regard, there are fascinating signs coming out of what may be a decisive battle to the northwest of Kyiv on the long, winding, secondary road from Chernobyl. This is the road where a 40-mile-long column of Russian vehicles was spotted by satellite. Most of the vehicles are supply trucks. They would be carrying fuel, ammunition, and food for the Russian forces that have advanced to the very outskirts of Kyiv itself but have seemingly been stalled for several days.

One attribute of a good intelligence officer is the ability to “feel” the battle. To pick up clues from the chaos of combat — the pace of events and where they happen, as well as odd silences, all mean something. Creating a coherent picture from the violence can then inform decisions that can lead to victory.

Out of this come three reports that, if true, suggest the beginnings of a devastating reversal for Russian forces operating northwest of Kyiv.

First, reports today in multiple outlets that Russian Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was killed in combat by a sniper. Sukhovetsky, 47, was an elite Russian Spetsnaz commando and veteran of Russia’s war in Syria. The commander of the Russian 7th Airborne Division, he was assigned the mission of leading the Russian thrust from Belarus to Kyiv. Men like Sukhovetsky have an outsized presence on the battlefield. They’re inspirational. Their personal leadership at the point of the spear often means the difference between victory and defeat during the fast-paced controlled violence of war. His loss would be devastating to his men and to the organizational momentum of the forces he commanded.

That Sukhovetsky was killed by a sniper suggests that he was personally trying to regain the initiative against Ukrainian forces who had fought him to a standstill.

The second report of merit is the heavy damage sustained in the town of Irpin on the northwest border of Kyiv’s city limits. The damage to this city suggests a major battle — an effort by the Russians to breakthrough. They didn’t.

The final piece of the puzzle is the Battle of Bucha. Ukrainian forces claimed the recapture of Bucha hours after the devastation visited on Irpin. The timing is important here. The Russians tried and failed to take Irpin and then the Ukrainians retook Bucha two miles to the northwest of Irpin.

Ukraine got back the city Bucha in the Kiev region. Raising the flag again! 🇺🇦#Ukriane #UkraineRussianWar pic.twitter.com/9zT2uiBuX4 — ✨️Frey🔥🧨 (@Melotraumatick) March 3, 2022

These events, combined with the nearby loss of Sukhovetsky, a two-star general, suggest a reversal of fortune for the Russians in the drive that’s come closest to Kyiv and, most importantly, threatens Kyiv’s logistics links to the west.

Of significance, Ukrainian success at Bucha put their Stinger antiaircraft missiles within range of Antonov International Airport, formerly the home of the world’s largest aircraft, until it was destroyed in fighting days ago. This means that Russia will no longer be able to safely fly cargo into the airport as Bucha’s town center is only two miles south of the airport, well within the Stinger’s 5-mile range.

Yet, hours after Bucha’s apparent recapture, there were widespread reports of Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers ranging further to the west and south of Kyiv, likely probing for weak spots in the Ukrainian defense in the direction of Zhytomyr, about 100 miles to the west of Kyiv, after being rebuffed on the most direct route to the capital city.

Lastly, as more and more Ukrainians mobilize and join local defense units, the regular Ukrainian Army and their reserve forces will be freer to maneuver — to counterattack the invading Russians with a greater degree of confidence knowing that the militia has secured the cities.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/russia-squeezes-southern-ukraine-but-ukrainians-rebound-in-northwest-battle-of-bucha/,2022-03-04
The War In Ukraine Has Put David Brooks In Such A Good Mood,"Image Credit Library of Congress Life/Wikimedia Commons

When you think about the war in Ukraine, in which untold numbers of people are dying, having their lives permanently uprooted and witnessing loved ones sent to emergency rooms, aren’t you elated and filled with admiration of yourself? David Brooks is!

The spectacled New York Times columnist could hardly contain himself this week, writing Thursday about the soul-stirring inspiration he feels as he watches violence, chaos, and destruction unfold 5,000 miles away.

“The Ukrainians have been our instructors and inspirers,” wrote Brooks. “We owe them such a debt. They have reminded us not only what it looks like to believe in democracy, the liberal order and national honor but also to act bravely on behalf of these things.”

He also noted his arousal at the display in “leadership” by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who “emerged as the everyman leader — the guy in the T-shirt, the Jewish comedian, the guy who didn’t flee but knew what to say.”

You get the sense that if such a conflict were to take place in America, Brooks would immediately send his wife and children to another country so that he could don a helmet and toss molotov cocktails at invaders while singing the national anthem.

But of course that’s not what would happen. Brooks, like so many others in Washington (both parties), are simply infantile romantics who think of war abroad as if it’s a movie or Nicholas Sparks novel. They’re easily manipulated by propaganda — yes, most or all of those moving video clips on social media of Ukrainians standing up to Russian soldiers with defiance are likely staged — and can only think of the deadly confrontation in ways that relate to themselves.

Stacey Abrams, who has not yet conceded her loss to be governor of Ukraine, said this week that her annoying saga to dismantle every attempt to secure our elections is just like— Ukrainians being killed by Russians!

“We are a stronger nation when we allow people to participate,” she said on Comedy Central (yes, really), “and if we ever doubted that … the war that [Vladimir] Putin is waging against Ukraine … this isn’t a war against Ukraine, this is a war on democracy in Ukraine.”

You hear that, children? Bloodshed in Eastern Europe is just like voter I.D. laws!

What’s happening in Ukraine is not a game. It’s not an opportunity for Democrats to continue their hysterical “democracy is under siege” campaign. And anyone treating it as such (virtually all of Washington and the national media) should be immediately regarded as an unserious dummy with no credibility in explaining the depressing reality of military conflict.

They don’t care about what’s actually happening, only that it makes them feel good.

A lot of people are about to die and the David Brookses and Stacey Abramses will continue to act like it’s something we should be beaming with pride about. But don’t let that ruin their good spirits.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/the-war-in-ukraine-has-put-david-brooks-in-such-a-good-mood/,2022-03-04
Ukraine Shows The World Why Gun Rights Are Human Rights,"The world is captivated by Ukraine’s resistance to Russian invasion, especially since much of Ukraine’s resistance comes from ordinary citizens taking up arms in defense of their homeland.

Ukraine has a fighting chance in part because it has taken dramatic steps to provide its people firearms. More than 25,000 automatic rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition have been distributed to volunteers in Kyiv.

In the United States, even supporters of draconian gun control are announcing they “stand with the brave Ukrainian people” in their armed resistance. The glaring contradiction between these positions — supporting gun confiscation one day and gun distribution the next — seemingly hasn’t dawned on many of these ideologues.

Their contradiction is apparent in actions, as well as in words. President Joe Biden’s rush to arm Ukrainians stands in contrast with his desire to disarm ordinary Americans.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is another prime example: engaging in tyrannical gun control at home while supplying the Ukrainian resistance with machine guns, pistols, carbines, and 1.5 million rounds of ammunition. The European Union shows a similar hostility to the self-defense rights of its people, even as it gives Ukraine about half a billion dollars’ worth of “lethal aid.”

Ukraine Late to Expand Gun Rights

Arming average citizens hasn’t always been the Ukrainian way, either. A 2014 report noted that the country had “inherited the Soviet civilian gun control system, which provides for restrictive gun owner licensing and the registration of all firearms.” According to that report, Ukraine initially considered imposing comprehensive gun laws during the 1990s. But politicians gridlocked over “whether or not private [gun] ownership would increase crime or improve security.”

Hopefully the events of 2022 have settled that question once and for all. An individual’s natural right of self-defense applies equally to the defense of his life as to the defense of his nation — and neither individual nor nation is secure without the ability to exercise it. This should never have been a question.

As it happened, Ukraine was tragically late to expand legal protection of gun rights. Its parliament acted on an emergency basis just before Russia invaded.

Better late than never, certainly. But imagine if the people of Kyiv had been training with these weapons their whole lives. Imagine if they knew them like the back of their hands, instead of quickly learning to handle them during an invasion. Their resistance, as well as their example to the world, would be all the more powerful.

Natural Right to Bear Arms

It’s also unfortunate that Ukraine’s government has left some significant restrictions on the self-defense rights of the Ukrainian people, and has only codified these rights in a statute rather than giving them full constitutional protection. In reality, the right to bear arms — in public and private — is a natural right that the Ukrainian people need no government permission to exercise. They just need the government to stay out of the way of their natural rights.

But in a time even many U.S. jurisdictions violate that natural right, it’s not surprising if other countries are confused about it.

Ukraine is certainly moving in the right direction on gun rights, something that can’t be said of the entire United States. The chairman of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, says the new law is meant “to ensure that every citizen receives the sacred right to self-defense.”

The people of Ukraine have a chance because they are armed. It’s a lesson the world should never forget.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/ukraine-shows-the-world-why-gun-rights-are-human-rights/,2022-03-04
"Until Biden Lets U.S. Oil Freely Flow, He's Complicit In Putin's War","As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, the United States and western allies have imposed a new round of economic sanctions. But these won’t achieve the desired effect as long as there is a carve-out for Russia’s energy sector.

Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on four large Russian banks and restricted certain Russian state-owned enterprises from raising money in international markets. On Monday, the U.S., the European Union, and the United Kingdom took an extraordinary step to sanction Russia’s central bank, the Bank of Russia, preventing it from moving assets it held abroad to stabilize Russia’s economy, or “using other government and private banks to manage central bank operations.” Additionally, the U.S. Department of Treasury prohibited Americans from doing business with Russia’s central bank, finance ministry, and Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. No country’s central bank had ever been sanctioned like this before. According to officials from the Biden administration, these latest sanctions targeting Russia’s banking and financial systems represent the West’s “biggest sanctions campaigns in the past half-century.”

Consequently, the Russian ruble tumbled more than 20 percent. At the market close on Monday, one ruble was worth less than 1 cent. The ruble’s devaluation will negatively affect Russia’s economy in many ways. It will worsen the country’s already high inflation (Russia’s inflation rate was 8.7 percent in January 2022), lower the living standard, and make it hard for Russian companies to raise capital for existing business operations or future expansion.

The ruble’s devaluation also hurts consumer confidence and may even cause a run on the bank. Nervous Russians reportedly lined up outside of banks and ATMs to get their money out, a scene the country hadn’t seen since the fall of the former Soviet Union in 1989.

In response, the Bank of Russia was forced to raise the interest rate from 9.5 percent to 20 percent and close the country’s stock market for this week. The central bank also ordered Russian companies to sell 80 percent of their foreign-currency revenue. The move was designed to stop the ruble from falling further by creating artificial supply-demand and giving the central bank access to foreign currencies such as U.S. dollars. The ruble bounced back some the next day due to these measures. As of Tuesday morning, one ruble was worth 8.6 cents.

Energy Sector Exempt

No doubt, the latest round of western sanctions has caused some damage to Russia’s economy. But they are not as effective as they could have been because Russia’s energy sector is exempted. Russia’s energy companies continue to export oil and gas worldwide, making phenomenal profit due to skyrocketing energy prices, and evade sanctions by bringing badly needed foreign currencies back to Russia.

The energy sector plays the most vital role in Russia’s economy, which is about the size of South Korea’s. Russia’s energy sector accounts for 14 percent of the country’s GDP. The country is the world’s largest natural-gas exporter and one of the main oil suppliers. Revenue from the energy sector has helped Russia accumulate $630 billion in foreign exchange reserves in recent years and contributed to more than 40 percent of the country’s federal budget.

A study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a think tank based in Germany, shows that an “embargo on gas would drag Russia’s GDP down by nearly 3 percent and halting imports and exports of crude oil would result in a slump of more than 1 percent.” However, by leaving Russia’s energy sector alone, current western sanctions may knock out Russia’s GDP by only 1 percent.

Justifying the Exemption

President Biden defended the carve-out of Russian energy from sanctions as necessary “to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.” Under his watch, gas prices have skyrocketed 60 percent, and the United States has doubled the amount of crude oil imports from Russia last year.

Although imports from Russia account for only 3 percent of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021, the United States is on track to become more dependent on Russia’s oil as President Biden doubles down on his war on the U.S. energy industry to advance “green energy.”

President Biden said another reason for exempting Russia’s energy sector from sanctions is to maintain the economic stability of our European allies, which are far more exposed to Russia’s energy industry due to their ongoing crusade against fossil fuels. About 30 percent of the European Union’s gas imports and 35 percent of its oil imports come from Russia.

Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, is even more vulnerable — 36 percent of its natural gas imports and close to 40 percent of its oil imports come from Russia. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany halted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to show solidarity with allies. But Germany’s move is mainly symbolic because it continues to import gas from Russia via the existing pipeline that runs through Ukraine.

Germany is also on track to phase out coal as soon as 2030 and will not extend the life of its three remaining nuclear power plants. Without Russia’s energy supply, some estimate the EU’s reserves would only allow its member nations, including Germany, to survive for three months.

Green Energy Puts Us in Weak Position

Ironically, the United States and European Union’s war on fossil fuel in their own backyard has forced them to rely on energy supplies from an adversary. Not sanctioning Russia’s energy sector neutralizes western sanctions and damages the credibility of the United States and our European allies.

How can Putin take us seriously when he gets a slap on the wrist on one hand but receives handsome payment on the other hand because we cannot live without his energy supply? How can leaders in the United States and the European Union sleep at night, knowing that Putin uses every cent we pay for every drop of oil from Russia to finance his war?

As a Wall Street Journal editorial points out, “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a 3 a.m. wake-up call to President Biden and America’s liberal political class: Cease your war on U.S. energy. Europe’s climate obsessions have rendered it vulnerable to Putin’s extortion, and the U.S. is in danger of repeating that tragic mistake.”

Suppose the United States and European uinon are serious about stopping Putin from committing more atrocities and ending the war on Ukraine. In that case, they must start sanctioning Russia’s energy sector immediately and hurt Putin where it hurts the most.

To alleviate economic pain back home, both the United States and the EU must halt their war on fossil fuel and free energy from ruinous policies. Without taking these steps, sanctions will not be effective, Putin has no incentive to change his behaviors, the Ukrainians will continue to suffer, and the United States and the EU look like nothing but hypocrites.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/until-joe-biden-lets-u-s-oil-freely-flow-hes-complicit-in-putins-war-crimes/,2022-03-04
Corrupt Media Pollsters Use Dishonest Tactics To Drag America Into War,"You may have heard over the weekend that Americans now “broadly support” imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. “A broad bipartisan majority of Americans think the United States should … work with NATO to set up ‘no-fly zones’ to protect Ukraine from Russian air strikes,” insisted a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday, noting that 74 percent of respondents supported the aggressive move.

The same poll, however, showed that only 39 percent of Americans want to see American troops sent to Ukraine, with fully 61 percent opposed — a statistic that was conveniently left out of the Reuters write-up (the report only mentioned vague “majorities” opposing boots on the ground). That gaping disconnect indicates two things: Most Americans cheering a no-fly zone don’t know what that would entail, and the warmongering media is using that ignorance to the advantage of its agenda.

Pollsters asking Americans if they support a no-fly zone aren’t explaining to them what the consequences of such an action would be. NATO has so far refused to enact a no-fly zone precisely because it would almost certainly lead to war, and Russia has made it clear it would interpret such a move as an act of war.

As my colleague John Daniel Davidson noted last week: “Of course a no-fly zone would mean just that: The U.S. would have to shoot down Russian warplanes, and Russian warplanes would very likely do the same to us. We would be in a shooting war with Russia before the no-fly zone was even established.” Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio agreed, saying a no-fly zone “would mean World War III.”

Reuters even admitted, four paragraphs into its report, that “It was not clear if respondents who supported a no-fly zone were fully aware of the risk of conflict.” Of course they weren’t, as evidenced by the 35-point difference between support for a no-fly zone and support for American troop involvement.

The poll also found 57 percent of Americans agreed that “Given the current economic climate, the United States cannot afford to be taking military action in Ukraine.” Six in 10 Americans also didn’t want to see the U.S. conduct airstrikes against Russia.

Pollsters didn’t even ask how many respondents would oppose a full-scale war with Russia, a number which would surely be even higher. In fact, look through the toplines of the survey and you won’t even find the word “war.”

There’s a real chance that if the United States and the rest of NATO are dragged into a full conflict with Russia over Ukraine, we could see a devastating nuclear war. That’s not a possibility our politicians and media should take lightly, but nevertheless, they continue to recklessly bandy about unserious responses to Russia’s aggression.

While Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., implores his Twitter followers to assassinate Vladimir Putin, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., urges a no-fly zone (while also peddling disproven propaganda), the censors who preach about fighting misinformation at home have happily allowed false stories about Ukraine that fit their pro-war agenda to propagate.

Meanwhile, another recent poll from Rasmussen Reports shows the broad divide between elites who are pushing for war and the actual people who would fight it. Overall, 49 percent of American voters answered “yes” to the question, “If a wider war breaks out in Europe, should the U.S. military be involved?”

But that belief is held by only 37 percent of respondents with an income below $30,000, compared to 66 percent of respondents making more than $200,000. The majority of U.S. military recruits come from middle-class backgrounds, a demographic that supports shedding American blood in Europe far less than the ruling class does.

"DC Has Prevented Nuclear Defense, So We Must Protect Ourselves","At the heart of a free society is the ability to engage in civil discourse about, among other things, the defense of one’s civilization. This is not, unfortunately, possible in America at present. Today we are living in the age of political narratives that are nothing more than lies told to serve some political end.

The current narrative is that the national security of the United States requires the defense of Ukraine against Russian aggression. Much as we abhor the suffering of Ukrainians, most especially children, however, a free Ukraine is not necessary for the defense of the United States.

The goal of American foreign policy is the peace and tranquility of the American people. It is, after all, the purpose for which our government is constituted. Our social compact is with each other as Americans. We do what is good for us and for our children.

We do this not out of selfishness, but out of the common sense that it is in man’s nature to defend one’s own, beginning with himself, his family, his community, and his country. Americans have demonstrated an admirable quality of fighting elsewhere on this planet for other people at other times. But even then, we were demonstrating a principle of American grand strategy that has served this country throughout its history: we want to fight wars somewhere else than in America.

Americans Fight Elsewhere So We Don’t Fight Here

The idea of fighting wars in other countries—France, Germany, Belgium, the island chain that led to the conquest of Imperial Japan, Korea, Vietnam, even Iraq and Afghanistan—meant we were not waiting until war came to the cities of the United States. We would rather fight on someone else’s territory in the simple belief that our homes would, at least for the time being, be safe from the ravages of war.

Also, fighting on or near the enemy’s territory meant we would have to be defeated and displaced from that position before war could be made on the United States directly. This is the kind of strategy that puts the well-being of the American people first. It has also, in the process, defended the West and liberated millions of human beings. But that was not our purpose. Our purpose was our own defense.

To be clear, Russia today does not have armed forces that are sufficient to invade and wage a successful war in the United States. Witness their current progress in Ukraine.

What Russia does possess is a nuclear arsenal that is capable of destroying the land-based nuclear forces of the United States, American cities and their populations, and American military bases abroad that do play a strategic role in the defense of the United States. They also possess advanced ballistic missile defense systems to protect Moscow and strategic positions throughout Russia.

The Russian S-400 and S-500 air and missile defense systems can deploy nuclear-tipped interceptors to ensure that the Russian homeland is defended from American ballistic missiles. What about America?

The U.S. Is Unprotected Against Russia and China

For all of our tough talk about America’s military might, the United States does not possess a missile defense capable of stopping Russian or Chinese ballistic missiles. We are also not able to stop a ship-launched ballistic missile should the Iranians or any other nation choose to serve as a surrogate for such an attack.

Although President Reagan proposed a missile defense 40 years ago, a comprehensive, multilayered missile defense system from land, sea, air, and space has never been completed. Not coincidentally, the Democratic Party has opposed building such a defense throughout this period, never more so than by Joe Biden as senator, vice president, and now as president.

Biden’s predecessor, Barack Obama, famously told Russian President Medvedev in 2012 to tell Putin not to worry about American missile defense, because Obama would have more “flexibility” after the election. This was Obama’s way of saying that he could not publicly come out against missile defense during a campaign year, but not to worry since he was not going to build one against the Russian arsenal anyway.

Russia Knows We Can’t Protect Ourselves

America’s Democratic elites, especially those in the White House today, have intentionally left us vulnerable to nuclear attack in the belief that war, especially nuclear war, was not possible. This was underscored by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announcing to the world that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”

But the Russians believe quite the opposite. They believe that war is man’s permanent condition and that nuclear weapons are merely one more aspect of war that must be mastered. The mere fact that they possess the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, are modernizing it with hypersonic reentry vehicles, and have built a missile defense to protect the Russian people, is evidence of this.

It is therefore not surprising that Russia does not take threats from the United States seriously. They know both that we do not possess a national missile defense and therefore won’t escalate hostilities beyond a certain point, and even if we did—out of a gross strategic miscalculation—we are ill-prepared to fight and win such an exchange. However sound Theodore Roosevelt’s admonition to “speak softly and carry a big stick” may have been through most of our history, speaking softly and carrying a big shield—as in ballistic missile defense—is a sounder corollary in the nuclear age.

Using Russia to Avoid Talking about China

Moreover, we have witnessed the political theatre of the U.S. intelligence agencies and the Democratic Party’s use of Russia as the prime threat to American freedom. However dangerous Russia may be, Communist China is the real threat to America. It has a population literally ten times that of Russia, a modern and advanced military, nuclear weapons, and an industrial capacity and GDP that is 7.5 times larger than Russia’s. No serious person thought the constant vilification of Russia was done for anything other than domestic political advantage in the left’s war against Donald Trump.

In retrospect, the focus on Russia looks more like a way for the U.S. Congress, controlled by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Sens. Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, to avoid addressing Communist China and their theft of American intellectual property, and its commercial expansion throughout the world through its Belt and Road Initiative. This does not even include the declaration by the Communist Chinese on May 13, 2019, of a People’s War against the United States.

That declaration was in response to the Trump administration’s demands to negotiate better trade deals. Within six months of that declaration, the Covid-19 virus was spreading from Wuhan, causing the loss of nearly 1 million American lives, wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy, and creating the conditions whereby a U.S. presidential election could be stolen. In the face of all this, nothing has been done to hold the Chinese Communist Party to account.

Weakness Provokes Aggression and Contempt

Russian intelligence may well have believed that a nation that was not going to hold Communist China responsible for its malfeasance was going to find some way to dance out of whatever political and economic fallout may occur over a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russians watched while Biden as Obama’s vice president had seen Ukraine as a country to exploit. Witness his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings. Also, given Biden’s long-time opposition to national missile defense, the Russians no doubt see Biden as someone who will not run the risk of nuclear conflict.

This kind of weakness is provocative and dangerous in the extreme. It is also incredibly cruel given that the United States under the Biden administration has consistently given tacit support for Ukraine to become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This has given Putin domestic political cover to invade and has given the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people the impression that they would be defended.

Finally, given the sorry fact that our government has left the American people vulnerable to ballistic missile attack, it would be irresponsible not to recommend that citizens and states immediately build preparedness. This means Americans should be preparing now for how best to provide for themselves and their families, for states to make sure they can maintain civil order, and for the federal authorities that are still loyal to the Constitution to make sure that our electric grid and strategic infrastructure are defended. This should be done in any case, for the simple reason that our national survival requires it.

Our enemies see weakness everywhere in Washington. It would be good to demonstrate to them the resolve of the American people, and to do so immediately.

Jen Psaki Is A Lying Liar Who Lies: Insane Gas Prices Edition,"President Joe Biden’s Press Secretary Jen Psaki tried to evade White House responsibility for soaring gas prices Monday, casting blame solely on overseas turmoil in Ukraine.

Gas prices hit a national average of $4.06 a gallon, according to AAA, this week reaching a new high not seen since 2008 when prices reached their all-time peak at $4.11.

“The increase,” Psaki said, “is a direct result of the invasion of Ukraine,” adding “there was an anticipation” of rising prices.

PSAKI: “The increase [in gas prices]…is the direct result of the invasion of Ukraine""



Gas prices rose $1.14 from Biden's inauguration to the day Putin invaded. pic.twitter.com/r9cRGgwn0A — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 7, 2022

In anticipation, however, the White House has only exacerbated a self-inflicted crisis by doubling down on the administration’s war on domestic energy production in the name of climate change and environmental justice. As the impending invasion of Ukraine foreshadowed turbulence in global energy markets, President Biden’s Department of Justice reinstated the administration’s suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal lands through a legal filing in Louisiana.

Despite Psaki’s blame on Russian aggression for the spike in energy costs, gas prices began to soar upon Biden’s first days in office after the president’s inaugural orders shut down the Keystone XL pipeline and unilaterally suspended new oil and gas leases on public land.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), American gas prices eclipsed an average of $3 per gallon by May as President Biden unleashed a cascade of taxes and regulation on the industry while moving to lock down lucrative reserves. In other words, gas prices have been rising since Biden took office, not since Russia launched its invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

Biden’s suspension of new drilling on federal lands, while temporarily overturned by a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana mid-summer, killed incentives in the capital- and labor-intensive industry for operations to keep up with demand, suppressing production. Producers require long-term planning and assurance their operations will remain in place before they pledge billions in new capital to drill in a particular area. That means new leases must always be on the horizon.

Cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline alone axed some 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude flowing to Gulf refineries while the U.S. simultaneously doubled imports of Russian oil. Last year, the U.S. welcomed an average of more than 600,000 barrels of Russian crude and related petroleum products daily, financing the Kremlin war machine. As the world’s third-largest oil producer providing more than 10 percent of global supply, Russia raked in $119 billion in resource revenues.

Biden is reluctant to sanction President Vladimir Putin’s energy sector, with the White House claiming the solution to rising prices is to pivot in favor of cleaner energy sources that are often unreliable and more expensive. Russian gas operations, meanwhile, produce 30 percent more methane than American operators. Iran, where the administration is hoping to lift sanctions and welcome its oil, hosts operations with 85 percent more intense methane emissions than their U.S. counterparts.

Biden could have brought down energy prices at any point in his presidency but instead has continued to escalate the administration’s animosity towards domestic production and the American worker. An enhanced regulatory regime combined with Wall Street pressure to restrict investment in the capital-intense industry has limited diplomatic options to counter Russian aggression by limiting domestic capacity to supplement supply shocks.

In Alaska for example, Democrats have sought to lock down decades worth of oil and gas reserves stored under a fraction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) with reinstated environmental protections poised to become permanent.

Instead of unleashing American energy potential to reclaim the independence once briefly achieved under the Trump administration, Biden officials are now pleading with authoritarian adversaries in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to ramp up production abroad.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/07/jen-psaki-is-a-lying-liar-who-lies-insane-gas-prices-edition/,2022-03-07
Diversity And Equity In The U.S. Military Endangers National Security,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should be a wake-up call for the sleeping European Union countries getting fat and lazy under America’s cozy security blanket. But it should also be a wake-up call for Americans who care about the U.S. military, because that security blanket is being pulled apart by the far-left.

War is the continuation of policy by other means, and how a country fights is a reflection of its domestic politics. If the left is allowed to control America’s military, we’ll soon be defended by social justice snowflakes, armed with weak sanctions and copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

Gen. Jim Mattis is right: the United States isn’t predestined to win the next war. Thankfully, Ukraine isn’t our war; 20 years of recent American bloodshed was enough. But one day our backs might be against the wall and we may not have a military capable of winning. While Washington has been obsessed with gender and race, Moscow and Beijing have been building armies undistracted by political correctness.

And I promise you that this woke obsession is going to cost lives, because mortars don’t pick between people when they explode and projectiles don’t care about skin color or genitalia. When bullets start ricocheting off Humvee doors, all the B.S. you think matters goes right out the window. In that moment, all that counts are the lives of the men and women around you.

If you’ve experienced combat, you know why there’s no room for wokeism in the military. It’s completely contradictory to mission success. What matters on the battlefield is the diversity of your firepower, not the diversity of your personnel.

My generation of veterans proves that the answer to race in the military is to judge people on merit, not identity. We just spent two decades risking life, limb, and eyesight fighting a war together; skin color, religion, and identity were irrelevant. We celebrated diversity by maintaining high standards.

I fought side by side with Afghans and Iraqis. While they bickered over tribal differences, their race, creed, and color weren’t a factor when I selected fighting forces from among them. Americans don’t care about tribal differences, because we’re are all one tribe.

But that’s not what our soldiers are being told. Instead, critical race theory is pitting our men and women in uniform against each another and the very country for which they fight. It’s hurting unit cohesion and damaging mission success.

You can’t go to war if you don’t believe in your country’s values. You can’t enforce American foreign policy at the point of a black rifle if you doubt its virtue. And you can’t defend the person next to you if you think they are your “oppressor” because of their skin color.

The far-left is forcing the same social engineering in the military that they force into everything else. When you select warfighters for anything other than capability, you’re going to get people killed.

What’s to prevent the military academies from taking race into account when admitting cadets? What happens to retention if some of the best noncoms are denied entry to the senior leader course because they’re the “wrong” color? What happens to combat effectiveness if there’s a race-based points system during Special Forces selection?

To most Americans, especially in the military community, this would be plain stupid. Not only is it morally wrong but, despite what you’ve been told, most Americans aren’t racists: we still believe in Martin Luther King Jr. and we want a color-blind society.

The military is one of the institutions that has historically helped to achieve King’s dream. That’s because it’s a forcing function, putting every kind of American in situations where each must succeed together regardless of his identity. The best business school in the country isn’t Harvard or Yale’s, it’s the U.S. military, teaching on campuses from Parris Island to Fort Bragg.

As a result, veterans provide a pool of talented leaders who contribute to their communities, uninterested in ideology. If you’re trying to complete a mission or turn a profit, you just want the best people.

This is why the far-left is gunning for our soldiers. In only one recent example, the U.S. Department of Defense saw fit to tweet an article telling soldiers that woke ideas like “equity” are necessities. They’re destroying the military in order to change our domestic culture and in doing so, they’re jeopardizing our ability to win wars.

Everyone who loves America should take the wake-up call of the Ukraine invasion very seriously. Despite the Biden administration’s wishful thinking, war is unfortunately part of the human condition. When the next one comes, our military needs to be made up of the most talented warfighters available, not people picked on the basis of their identity.

They need to know that they are doing the right thing, on behalf of a good and just United States. And they need a president who has the backbone to say so.

"Russia's Latest Maneuvers Suggest A Long, Destructive Battle For Ukraine","When Russian President Vladimir Putin greenlighted the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, he expected a quick collapse of the Ukrainian government. Had Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fled, Putin might have seen the installation of a pro-Moscow puppet regime that would have greatly lessened the need for Russian occupation forces. It didn’t happen as planned.

Now, some 180,000 Russian troops of the initial force of 200,000 are estimated to have been committed to the invasion. This force is pressing in on a nation of 46 million people with a territory almost as large as Texas.

Ukraine’s active military at the onset of the war was 200,000. Their reserve forces are reported to be as high as 900,000 with another 7 million people who are fit for military duty.

With Putin’s political objective of installing a friendly government in Kyiv out of reach, the Russians now seem intent on increasing the cost of resistance to Ukraine, depriving the nation of electricity and water while driving millions of refugees into Europe.

Comparing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the north, east, and south, with the German-led invasion from the west and southwest in 1941 yields some interesting comparisons.

In 1941, the German Army Group South had about 941,000 soldiers and 1,000 tanks. The Romanian military, with a German army attached, mustered about 640,000 men and 250 tanks from the southwest. Hungarians contributed another 30,000 in the early stages of the invasion. Facing the Axis onslaught. Thus, about 1.6 million men were committed to the operation — about eight times larger than the force Russia has committed so far.

Facing them were two Red Army groupings (called fronts) totaling slightly more than 1 million men with almost 5,700 tanks.

The Germans invaded on June 22, 1941. By Aug. 23, two months later, the battle of Kiev had started and by Sept. 26, the Soviet defenders having been surrounded, the city was taken. The distance to Kyiv from the German jumping-off points in occupied Poland was almost double the distance of the Russian staging areas in Russia northeast of Kyiv.

Also of note, the Axis began its siege of Odessa on Aug. 8. The mostly Romanian-led effort to reduce the city lasted for about 10 weeks until Oct. 16. Unlike today for Ukraine, however, the Soviet Union had a modest ability to resupply the port city by the Black Sea.

Importantly, under Stalin, Ukrainians were largely disarmed. Anti-Axis partisans eventually numbered more than 250,000 in Ukraine, but these formations had to be armed and supplied by Soviet efforts (though some were soldiers caught up in 1941’s massive pockets who escaped into the woods and marshes rather than surrender).

While modern weaponry, sensors, and communications allow for different tactics, the basic math of an occupation stands—soldiers on the ground are required to occupy a region. With insufficient soldiers, the terrain is only temporarily held. As analysts pour through open-source information to try to understand the largest conflict Europe has seen since the end of WW2, there have been numerous products produced to illustrate what’s happening. One of the better ones is a daily update from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

The analysts at ISW distinguish between areas they assess as “Russian controlled” vs. those areas that Russian forces have merely advanced through. Even so, this approach can be misleading.

Nathan Ruser with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has produced a completely different set of maps that, in many ways, is far more revealing.

Mr. Ruser has traced the routes Russian battalion tactical groups have taken as they attempt to impose Moscow’s will on Kyiv. Ruser’s map shows a series of highways and secondary roads over which the Russians must maintain supply lines, provide local security from Ukrainian attacks, and maintain a basic level of anti-aircraft capacity.

There are three additional points to consider in comparing Ruser’s map with the more conventional ISW map.

First, the Russian mud season — Rasputitsa (no relation to Rasputin) — usually runs a month or two in the fall and in the spring. There was no hard freeze in Ukraine this year, so Rasputitsa never ended. This means that vehicles leaving a hardball road risk becoming mired and photos from the conflict suggest many have.

Second, the areas north of Kyiv, to the west and east of the Dnieper River, are very marshy. This further restricts off-road movement. Complicating this matter for the Russian invaders is the reported intentional flooding of the low-lying areas north of Kyiv. This action mirrors measures taken by the Dutch to slow the German attack in 1940 — measures the Germans took themselves in 1944-45.

Third, modern armies are far more road-bound than armies of the past. Few Russian soldiers dismount from their vehicles until in actual combat. As a result, significant portions of the Ukrainian countryside have yet to be pacified by the Russians.

Thus, in addition to the Russian force being of insufficient size to occupy Ukraine, the way it has been deployed and is being resupplied opens up a major vulnerability: its forces are stretched out along roads and not able to provide mutual support. The Ukrainians reportedly took advantage this of over the weekend when a sortie out of Kharkiv ambushed Russian forces northwest of the city (Shown as the thin blue line on the ISW map).

Lastly, one other important development to consider.

Sometime on Friday, a Ukrainian military cargo aircraft was seen flying to an airport just outside of Istanbul, Turkey. The location of the airport was close to Baykar, the Turkish firm that designed and builds the Bayraktar TB2, an armed drone used to great effect by the Ukrainians in the opening days of the conflict. The aircraft returned to a Polish airfield near Lviv. In all likelihood, this aircraft was filled with Bayraktar TB2 and control stations. Days earlier, it was reported that several Turkish Air Force cargo flights were made between Ankara and Rzesow in southern Poland. Concurrently, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced that a shipment of new Turkish combat drones were pressed into service.

Look for the replenished stock of Bayraktar TB2s to begin targeting Russian surface-to-air missile systems thus allowing the remaining Ukrainian air force to begin attacking Russian columns of armor and supply trucks with a reduced likelihood of being shot down.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/07/russias-latest-military-maneuvers-suggest-a-long-destructive-battle-for-ukraine/,2022-03-07
"Ukraine, The New Right, And Defending The West","The Russian invasion of Ukraine has proven thus far to be a difficult puzzle for the American right. The reaction of conservatives to the foreign policy of the Barack Obama years was to slam his decisions as unserious, naive, or weak, inviting America’s enemies to exploit us.

This is their natural posture, and one that has largely held despite Donald Trump’s very different approach to foreign policy. President Joe Biden’s administration has allowed conservatives to return to this posture in its first year, particularly in the misbegotten Afghanistan exit, which went so terribly and embarrassed Americans, even those who supported an end to the war.

The trouble with Ukraine for the right is that it cuts in several different directions, and leaves their leaders uncertain as to the proper and politically justifiable response. As I predicted last week, Trump himself is facing this difficulty today. But there is a path forward for conservatives that rejects both the reflexive anti-interventionism of the New Right and the reflexive interventionism of neoconservatism.

In illuminating that path, it must be acknowledged that the latter approach set the conservative national security agenda for a disastrous 20 years. Incepted in the debates over whether America should “go to Baghdad” in the 1991 war, the neoconservative domination of the right’s national security vision was rooted in two premises.

One was that America was positively obligated to advance the world toward the broad sunlit uplands of liberal democracy. (You might call it a progressive ethic.) The other premise was that America could do pretty much anything. This was an easy sell in the 1990s, in the golden moment when America actually could do nearly anything — outside the Mogadishu city limits, anyway. The reality of American power, the fact of what America could do, obscured the need for a debate on what America should do.

Sometime around the April 2004 battle for Sadr City, the limits of what America could do came into focus. That focus became increasingly sharp through the next decade, as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan dragged on to no discernible purpose, as the ISIS threat flared up, as America involved itself in the Yemeni war, and as Americans found themselves fighting and dying in the remote Sahel.

Whatever sense of purpose attached itself to the post-9/11 wars ebbed away as Americans grasped that they were effectively locked into small and bloody conflicts, endless scraps with ferocious tribesmen and motivated fanatics, in faraway places of which they knew little and cared less. One of the neoconservative pillars was eroded, and eventually fell.

The other pillar — asserting an American mission to remake the world — experienced its apogee in January 2005, with George W. Bush’s second inaugural. “The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world,” said the president, and he committed America to “[t]he great objective of ending tyranny.” That commitment lasted just under 24 months. By the close of that president’s second term, American objectives had diminished from ending tyranny worldwide to pacifying Anbar.

As John Agresto wrote in a piece in Commentary magazine a decade ago:

“Don’t all people yearn for freedom?” we have asked. And we assume the answer is yes. But the answer is no. Some people, perhaps most people, prefer other goods. Indeed, some people would rather be holy than free, or safe than free, or be instructed in how they should lead their lives rather than be free. Many prefer the comfort of strong answers already given rather than the openness and hazards of freedom. There are those who would never dream of substituting their will for the imam’s or pushing their desires over the customs and traditions of their families. Some men kiss their chains. As good Americans, we may wish to say that all people deserve freedom. But to say that all people desire it is flat-out wrong.

Set against this record of squandered lives and opportunity, the New Right’s reaction to it — a full-on descent into anti-interventionism that would be familiar to a prairie populist of 1937 — is completely understandable. Whatever the objective merits, their reaction is a rational one. The New Right anti-interventionists note, correctly, that they bear little responsibility for the parlous state of America’s national security now. But they err in their belief that their policy and ideological preferences represent a road not traveled.

The destructive arrogance of neoconservatism is matched by the abysmal historical record of American isolationism and anti-interventionism, which took America out of the European tumult of the 1920s and 1930s, to no one’s benefit; and which also sank America into a brief period of quasi-isolationism in the post-Vietnam 1970s, culminating in real existential danger to America by that decade’s end.

If the twin premises of neoconservatism have been shown wrong by events, then the twin premises of the anti-interventionist New Right — that America will be fine without any engagement abroad, and the world will allow us a peaceful withdrawal from the same — are being proven wrong this very moment.

There is no purpose in recapitulating the scope and meaning of the Ukrainian war here. Suffice it to say that if a “border dispute between Russia and Ukraine” — to borrow a phrase deployed by the New Right in its arguments against American involvement — proceeds in less than a week to the Russian dictator obliquely threatening nuclear war upon the United States, then we may have no real choice but to be involved.

I don’t mean going to war: That would be insane, futile, and disastrous, and the chances for an actual nuclear exchange, whatever it is, would be unacceptably high. I do mean doing things the New Right doesn’t wish to do: taking sides, rendering moral judgments, and sending guns and ammunition to the people of Ukraine.

The American people agree with me. They didn’t one week ago. They do now. They do because the policy space in this sphere is shifting rapidly — right out from under the feet of everyone who believed that the inevitable conservative stance on national security was henceforth anti-war, anti-intervention, and isolationist. The New Right, focusing upon ideological and policy battles, failed to address the real arena where policy is made. It accurately took the measure of neoconservatives — and failed to take the measure of Americans.

It turns out that Americans grasp that it’s foolish to try to make people like themselves — but they sure are happy to lend a hand when they see people who are like themselves. It also turns out that Americans have a pretty good grasp of the national interest, and factor both sentiment and calculation into their preference on what ought to be done.

What we see illuminated in the rapid shift of Americans on Ukraine is actually the pathway toward a moderate, realist, interest-based American national security approach that falls into neither the cul de sac of the New Right, nor the dead end utopianism of neoconservatism. An America that has no messianic mission, does not automatically assume that it can do anything, and also possesses the self-confidence and competence to act as a force for good in the wider world, is an America that reflects what Americans actually want. It is an America where a real discussion of the national interest can be had, without the obscuring and distorting priors inflicted by neocons and New Right alike.

The signal quality of this approach — not non-ideological, but perhaps prudentially ideological — is its ability to allow circumstance to shape American engagements. Pull away the millennial ambitions of a perfected world, and it becomes possible to grasp that America need not squander blood and treasure in Niger, or Yemen, or Helmand. Discard the rigid strictures of a belief that America can do no good, and it becomes possible to understand that America can see to its own interest and be a force for freedom in places like Ukraine, Korea, and Taiwan.

What does this prudentially ideological, interest-based national-security conservatism look like now? It is probably a singular focus upon the threat from the People’s Republic of China — our only true peer competitor and existential threat — coupled with an understanding that the peace of Europe, frayed as it is, must be maintained so we can keep that focus.

It is probably a renewed attention to our southern border, where state collapse has rendered Mexico more antagonist than friend. It is probably the defense of a global order where America is the security hegemon, and the American dollar the currency of choice — not because we seek to rule, but because the benefits to Americans are so manifest, and so bountiful.

As in so many areas of American life, in the realm of foreign policy we have placed our trust in the experts, and see them squander and abuse it, leaving Americans feeling ignored and disrespected. It is time to listen to them, and in so doing, chart a path toward a clear-eyed foreign policy that maintains order, security, and peace, while seeking our national interest above all.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/07/ukraine-the-new-right-and-defending-the-west/,2022-03-07
Why Cheerleading Visa’s Russia Ban Is A Recipe For Disaster,"Image Credit Karolina Grabowska/Pexels

Visa joined dozens of other Western companies this weekend when it cut off “all Visa transactions” in Russia. You should think twice, however, before cheerleading the financial services company for banning citizens’ transactions in an attempt to fight back against Vladimir Putin.

Visa’s decision to divorce its brand from Russia is part of a global push to punish the Russian regime for invading Ukraine. According to Al Kelly, chairman and CEO of Visa Inc., “we are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed.”

While it might be tempting to commend Visa for going to bat for the suffering people of Ukraine, the credit card company does not deserve any praise for executing its decisions based on a political agenda and pushing Russia even closer to communist China.

Kelly claims that “this war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,” but guess what happens when Visa’s values don’t align with people at home? Unfortunately, you don’t have to guess. Visa, which is regularly badgered by leftist activists to cut off conservatives, has a history of throwing fits over both global and domestic policies that don’t align with the company’s increasingly left-wing values.

Shortly after the events on Jan. 6, 2021, Visa’s political action committee cut off donations to American politicians to absolve the company of any role in “inciting violence.” The company claimed that “we are vigilant in our efforts to deter illegal activity on our network, and we require our affiliate banks to review their merchants’ compliance with our standards.”

Dozens of other financial institutions also announced penalties for users they believed played a role in the events at the Capitol riot. After a federal probe was launched, Bank of America gladly handed over the records and data associated with users who made purchases in the D.C. area on or around Jan. 6.

In early 2021, GoFundMe pledged to nuke fundraisers hosted by users or groups who questioned the integrity of the 2020 election. More recently, the fundraising company, at the behest of the government, tried to punish Canadian truckers protesting for freedom from tyrannical governments by stealing their millions of dollars and pledging to redistribute the money to its own list of leftist charities. The company ultimately decided to return the donations after it faced backlash but did not apologize for buying into the lie that the truckers were “a threat to our democracy.”

Venmo, JPMorgan Chase, and other companies have long histories of cutting off certain users because of their political affiliations too. Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter also have a running list of politically-motivated censorship sins that they committed after encouragement from the federal government.

Do we really want companies that habitually smear conservatives as violent insurrectionists to be the ones developing U.S. foreign policy and deciding global affairs? The same companies that fell over each other to donate to Black Lives Matter after rioters wreaked havoc on businesses, churches, and government buildings don’t need to be deciding who needs to be punished at home and abroad.

Global financial companies have been emboldened by events in recent years to make political decisions that have massive consequences. But when we cheer private companies motivated by leftist elites for deciding who should be politically punished overseas, we’re inviting them to keep doing it here.

Biden To Ban Russian Oil While Refusing To Ramp Up U.S. Production,"Image Credit Nur Andi Ravsanjani Gusma/Pexels

Gas prices hit a record high on Tuesday shortly before news surfaced that President Joe Biden plans to cut off Russian oil, natural gas, and coal imports into the U.S.

After one year of torpedoing American energy independence, the Biden administration is attempting to take more serious action against Russia after its sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime were criticized for being too little and too late.

Biden’s embargo on Russian oil, however, is only going to exacerbate the crisis he created by refusing to ramp up domestic oil production.

Contrary to media narrative, gas prices were on the rise well before the invasion of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/OE9EuZ7JgT — Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) March 8, 2022

Even before the Russo-Ukraine conflict, Americans were struggling to keep up with rising gas prices under the Biden administration’s policies, which relinquished American energy independence, and the corporate media predictably lied about it.

FLASHBACK: CNN went all out to hype a small decrease in gas prices in December as a sign of better days…This did not age well. https://t.co/Kew3Jre0yj pic.twitter.com/XoFJHAJ8XB — MRCTV (@mrctv) March 8, 2022

After Biden wrecked domestic production by suspending oil and gas leases, axed projects such as the Keystone Pipeline, canceled Arctic drilling leases, and pushed a cascade of taxes and regulation on the industry all in his first year in office, domestic gas prices rose dramatically and quickly became a sore spot for Americans, many of whom have indicated they’re looking for a change in the November midterms.

As the White House prepares to roll out its ban on Russia, the world’s largest exporter of oil, to hold the nation “accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine,” it’s also gearing up to possibly strike a deal with foreign enemies and Russian allies Venezuela and Iran to supplement the oil supply hole left by nixing Russian imports into the U.S., which doubled last year.

Already, the White House sent a delegation to Trump-sanctioned Venezuela to discuss pumping the nation’s state oil into the U.S., and as President Nicolás Maduro said, “for the stability of the world.” Venezuela produces 500 percent more methane than U.S. producers, but Biden, who justified his war on U.S. oil by claiming he wanted to prioritize green energy, seems to have turned a blind eye to that fact and appears to be willing to strike a deal anyway. The White House also seems unbothered that just a couple of years ago, the United States tried to overthrow the Maduro regime but is now hoping it will sell Americans oil.

While most of the West was quick to denounce Putin’s actions in Ukraine, Venezuela and Iran both have boosted their relationships and support for the disgraced nation in the last couple of weeks. In the past year, Russia, communist China, Venezuela, and Iran have all signaled their willingness to team up and exploit the Iran deal against the United States.

The Biden administration previously sought Moscow’s assistance in reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow is still involved in those negotiations.

Democrats Are Putin’s Climate Stooges While He Uses Oil To Wage War,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine marks the end of the West’s Era of Illusions. It was an era in which Western elites obsessed about solving climate change because the climate crisis was far more dangerous than issues of war and peace and the stability of the international system. They even convinced themselves that climate change causes war, so climate change policy could double as national security policy; and, for many years, the annual round of kumbaya UN climate talks was the apogee of international relations.

In a BBC World Service interview, presidential climate envoy John Kerry expressed concern about the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted from the war in Ukraine. Kerry was just getting warmed up with a string of platitudes that show him as a deluded climate relic, unable to come to terms with the reality that Putin has imposed on the world.

“Equally importantly,” Kerry complained, “you’re going to lose people’s focus,” as if the first invasion of a sovereign European country since the Second World War is an annoying distraction. Hopefully, Kerry continued, Putin would realize that Russia’s land is thawing, and the people of Russia are at risk.

Kerry concluded with an expression of pure self-deception, saying he hopes Putin “will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.” Stay on track? Russia has never hidden its intention to avoid cutting its emissions.

Russia’s second Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted in November 2020 under the Paris climate agreement, is to limit its 2030 emissions to “no more than 70% of 1990 levels.” The document is careful to avoid pledging to cut or reduce emissions.

The 1990 baseline year was the last one before the collapse of the highly inefficient and heavily polluting centrally planned Soviet economy. Thus, the 70% limit actually enables Russia to increase its emissions by 34% – and that’s before taking account of any changes in forestry and land use that would allow Russia to claim credit for negative emissions.

Despite Kerry’s claim about the thawing of their frozen north, Russians’ indifference to climate change predates Putin’s rise to power. During preparation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) first assessment report in 1990, Soviet scientists argued that warming might be beneficial at northern latitudes. Yuri Izrael, the Soviet academician and chair of the IPCC’s working group examining potential impacts of global warming, emphasized the doubt and uncertainty of climate change and disputed claims that it would be harmful.

At a 2005 conference on avoiding dangerous climate change organized by Britain during its G-8 presidency, Putin’s former economic adviser, Andrei Illarionov, challenged the premise of the conference. “Anyone who is frightened about the prospect of global warming is welcome to come and live in Siberia,” Illarionov told a journalist.

Indeed, a strong case can be made that Russian climate scientists have a better understanding of climate science and the likely impact of rising levels of carbon dioxide on global temperatures than their colleagues in the West. In testimony to Congress in 2016, John Christy, the Alabama state climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, compared 102 climate-model simulations against observed global temperature of the mid-troposphere from satellites and balloons (the troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, up to a height of around 33,000 feet).

On average, the models warmed the atmosphere at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than what happened in the real world. The only model that produced simulations close to observations was the Russian INM-CM4 climate model. Small wonder Russians are disinclined to believe there’s a climate crisis.

When it comes to the science of climate change, there can be few people quite as gullible and simpleminded as Kerry. “I can remember from when I was in high school and college, some aspects of science or physics can be tough – chemistry. But this is not tough,” Kerry told an audience of school children in Indonesia in 2014, when he was secretary of state. “This is simple. Kids at the earliest age can understand this.”

The science was “absolutely certain,” Kerry claimed: “Let me give you an example. When an apple separates from a tree, it falls to the ground.” Contrast Kerry’s simplistic analogy with this statement in the IPCC’s third assessment report: “The climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible,” the IPCC said in 2001, before it became deeply politicized as it is now.

There is, however, one area where Kerry and Putin are likely to find themselves in full agreement. Two years ago, at a business conference in Moscow, the Russian president denounced fracking as “barbaric,” claiming that fracking technologies “destroy the environment.” A January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian activities in U.S. elections noted that RT, the Russian state-owned news channel, ran anti-fracking programming that highlighted the alleged environmental and public health harms of the practice.

“This is likely reflective of the Russian Government’s concern about the impact of fracking and US natural gas production on the global energy market and the potential challenges to Gazprom’s [the Russian state-owned energy company] profitability,” the assessment concluded.

In June 2014, Kerry’s predecessor as secretary of state complained about the impact of Russian money on financing “astroturf” environmental campaigns. “We were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media. We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I’m a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, ‘Oh that pipeline, that fracking, that whatever will be a problem for you,’ and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia,” Hillary Clinton said.

Putin understands the importance of energy as an essential component of American strategic power. John Kerry does not. That is why, to borrow from Lenin, Kerry acts as Putin’s useful climate idiot. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine plunges the world into its gravest emergency since the Cuban missile crisis sixty years ago. It puts into perspective the folly of those, like Kerry, who confuse imaginary crises with real ones.

Full List Of Every Lie Biden Has Told As POTUS: 223 And Counting,"Updated Feb. 7, 2023. Two hundred twenty-three lies and counting.

More than two years into President Joe Biden’s time in the White House and the end to his lies is nowhere in sight. Here is part three of The Federalist’s rigorous coverage keeping the Biden administration accountable with substantive fact-checking throughout the president’s tenure.

You can find part two of “The Full List Of Every Lie Joe Biden Has Told As President” here.

223. Chuck Schumer Is Minority Leader

Before his State of the Union speech even began, Biden greeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as “Senate minority leader.” Schumer has been the majority leader since Biden took office in 2021.

Biden: ""Congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another term as Senate minority leader. You know, only this time you have a slightly bigger majority. You are the majority leader. Not that much bigger?"" pic.twitter.com/VlTFx9t9rH — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 8, 2023

222. More Jobs Created in Two Years Than Any Other President

“I actually created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs,” Biden said during his State of the Union address. “More jobs created in two years than any president has created in four years. Because of you.”

Biden didn’t create new jobs, as he often likes to claim. The only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of Covid-19.

221. Fastest Growth in 40 Years

On Feb. 7, 2023, during his annual speech to Congress, Biden repeated his infamous lie that he initiated the “fastest job growth in 40 years.”

Records show, however, that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During approximately that same time period, the unemployment rate also declined by 8.3 percent.

In January alone, American payroll jobs under Biden fell by more than 2.5 million.

220. Inflation Is ‘Coming Down’

Another lie Biden repeated during his State of the Union address is that inflation in the U.S. “is coming down.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are suffering from gas prices still well above $3 per gallon, weathering a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021. Biden may not be responsible for the fastest job growth in the last four decades, but inflation under his watch rose at its fastest rate in 40 years.

[READ: Biden, Media Taunt Struggling Americans By Insisting 6.5% Inflation Is A Good Thing]

Biden tried to blame the nation’s economic misfortune on the pandemic and the “unfair and brutal war in Ukraine,” but the truth is, inflation in the U.S. directly coincides with the time he took office.

219. Democracy Faced ‘Greatest Threat Since Civil War’ on Jan. 6

President Biden forgot about the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the repeat episodes of violence at the Capitol when he claimed at the 2023 State of the Union that the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, was the “greatest threat since the Civil War.”

Look at McCarthy’s reaction as Biden repeats the lie that the Jan 6 riot was the greatest threat since the Civil War.

Biden made the same hyperbolic claim at his first State of the Union address before Congress in April 2021.

[READ: Jan. 6 Is Important Because It’s Epiphany, Not The Solemn Anniversary Of A Fake Insurrection]

218. I’m Responsible for the Largest Deficit in U.S. History

Biden wants to take credit for cutting the national deficit “by more than $1.7 trillion — the largest deficit reduction in American history” in his first two years in office.

“Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor,” Biden said at the 2023 State of the Union.

The truth is, federal spending under Biden increased more than $10 trillion since his first month in office. That’s more than any other president spent in his first two years in U.S. history.

217. Republicans Are Trying to Cut Social Security

Biden pledged to halt desperately needed cuts to bloated entitlement programs as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling.

“If anyone tries to cut Social Security,” the president said during his annual address to Congress, “I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.”

The Democrats’ reconciliation bill passed last summer, however, raided nearly $300 billion from Medicare to boost insurance companies by removing leverage from negotiations on drug prices.

""If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.""

216. Fires Have Burned an Area the Size of Missouri

President Biden tried to claim during his State of the Union speech that more wood had been burned by forest fires than the area of the entire state of Missouri.

“More timber has been burned than I’ve observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri,” Biden said.

In 2022, however, 7.5 million acres burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Missouri’s forests span 14 million acres, and the state itself is 44.6 million acres large.

The remark appears to have been made off-script according to what the White House released as the president’s prepared speech.

215. Biden Repeats Claim that Fast-Food Workers Sign Noncompete Agreements

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could be seen chuckling in the background at the State of the Union when Biden complained that fast-food workers were signing noncompete agreements with employers.

“A cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more,” Biden said.

Biden claims that McDonald’s cashiers sign noncompete agreements which prevent them from working for other burger chains. 😂 pic.twitter.com/cXyPHE7lvk — John Curtis (@Johnmcurtis) February 8, 2023

Biden made the same claim at a business roundtable in July 2020, earning the then-candidate a “false” rating from PolitiFact.

214. Biden Blames Crime Wave on Covid After Democrats Defunded Police

During the 2023 State of the Union, Biden blamed the coronavirus lockdowns for the nation’s recent crime wave.

Covid left scars, the president said, “like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.”

It was the Democrats’ rush to “defund police,” however, that left cities and neighborhoods vulnerable to criminals who remained free to roam the streets. Democrats in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and New York cut police funding by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the social justice fever that took over the country. More than a dozen cities saw the highest homicide rates ever reported as a result.

According to a poll from Politico last year, 3 in 4 Americans blamed the crime spree on the efforts to defund police.

213. I Re-Upped Funding for Cancer Research

One of Biden’s top priorities going into his 2023 State of the Union speech was his “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, which allocates funding to cancer research and care.

“Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead,” Biden said.

Biden may have restarted the program to “provide more support for patients and families,” but it was his pet legislation, the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act, that cut cancer research spending by nine times as much as his program is supposed to put toward it.

212. Immigration ‘Reform’ Will Secure the Border

During his annual address to Congress, Biden pointed to his “new border plan” as evidence that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding the U.S.

But his plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives, something several hecklers pointed out during his speech.

Biden said his “comprehensive immigration reform” would “fix” the national security threat that American border woes have become. In reality, that legislation would only encourage the millions of migrants overwhelming Border Patrol agents to keep paying the criminal organizations that control northern Mexico to escort them to the U.S.

211. Mass Shootings Went Down After Assault Weapons Ban

Biden claimed during the State of the Union that the federal assault weapons ban, which barred the manufacturing of semi-automatic rifles for civilian use from 1994 to 2004, caused mass shootings to drop.

“In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said.

That’s a lie based on a flawed study that claimed the ban reduced mass shooting deaths. Accurate data recorded during the ban shows that more so-called mass shootings occurred during the firearm prohibition. Even after the ban expired, mass shootings did not increase, as Democrats suggested they would.

210. Life-Saving Pro-Life Laws Are Extreme

During his State of the Union address, Biden wrongfully characterized pro-life legislation in several red states as “extreme” for limiting women’s ability to kill their unborn babies.

“Already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans,” he said.

In reality, it’s Biden’s abortion-on-demand throughout all nine of months of pregnancy agenda that is extreme. New polling suggests 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy.

Biden also criticized Republicans for trying to pass what he said is a “national abortion ban.”

As pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America noted, the GOP has not proposed a total ban on abortions. It has just worked to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries, which recognize abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a barbaric practice.

209. ‘I’m Here to Be President for All Americans’

In addition to promising unity via bipartisan cooperation, Biden falsely claimed during his address to Congress on Feb. 7, 2023, that he is “here to be president for all Americans.”

Yet the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him. His smears against “MAGA Republicans” shows he has no tolerance for conservative voters or their values.

A president for all wouldn’t sic his Department of Justice on parents concerned that their children’s education stays indoctrination free or a pro-life father who rightfully defended his son from a deranged abortion activist.

208. Biden Claims ‘No’ Blame For Inflation

Biden refuses to take responsibility for the inflation crippling the nation despite its clear connection to his administration and policies.

“Do you take any blame for inflation?” a reporter asked the president on Feb. 3, 2023.

“Do I take any blame for inflation? No,” Biden replied.

“Why not?” the reporter countered.

“It was already here when I got here, man! Remember what the economy was like when I got here?” Biden asked.

REPORTER: ""Do you take any blame for inflation?""



BIDEN: ""No.""



REPORTER: ""Why not?""



BIDEN: ""It was already there when I got here, man!"" pic.twitter.com/ErvzSQVC4n — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) February 3, 2023

The economy before Biden’s inauguration may have suffered from government-mandated lockdowns, but that suffering drastically increased in March of 2021 shortly after Biden took office, when the new administration greenlit Congress’s $1.9 trillion spending bill.

Since then, inflation rose at its fastest rate in 40 years and still hovers far above pre-pandemic price hikes.

207. Biden Says He Began Career as Civil Rights Activist

President Biden told congregants at Georgia’s Ebenezer Baptist Church on the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day that he began his career as a mid-20th-century civil rights activist. Biden said he “started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”

While at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Joe Biden once again claims he was a civil rights activist: “When I started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”



This is a debunked lie. pic.twitter.com/CY6x07IN2N — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 15, 2023

On his first campaign for president, however, Biden disputed his participation in the movement.

“I was not an activist,” Biden said at a Washington press conference in September 1978. “I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. I was involved, but I was not out marching. I was not down in Selma, I was not anywhere else.”

206. Biden Says He Went to a Black Church as a Teen

President Biden also told congregants at the Ebernezer Baptist Church that he went to a predominantly black church as a teenager.

BIDEN: ""I used to go to 7:30 mass every morning in high school and then in college, before I went to the Black church. Not a joke.""



Congregants say they can't recall Biden ever attending. pic.twitter.com/4xcF6i0nFE — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 15, 2023

Members of the president’s supposed former church, however, don’t remember him.

205. Biden Claims He Taught Classes at UPenn

While speaking at the North America Leaders’ Summit in Mexico City on Jan. 10, Biden claimed he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania “four years after being vice president.” While Biden was paid nearly $1 million by the university, he reportedly never taught a class there.

204. Biden Blames J6 Rioters for Capitol Police Officer’s Death

During an overtly political speech marking the two-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Biden falsely claimed that Officer William “Billy” Evans died as a result of “threats by these sick [Jan. 6] insurrectionists.”

Joe Biden just said that Capitol Police Officer William Evans died as a result of ""threats by these sick insurrectionists.""

Contrary to the president’s assertion, Evans was killed three months after the Jan. 6 riot in April 2021 by a Nation of Islam supporter who killed the officer by running him down with a car. The instance marks the second occasion in which Biden has conflated Evans’s death with the events of Jan. 6.

203. Biden Says Guns’ Only Use Is to ‘Kill People’

In a commemorative statement honoring the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, Biden falsely claimed that the only use for weapons like those used in the shooting is to “kill people.”

“I am determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless other mass shootings in America,” Biden said in an official statement. “Enough is enough. Our obligation is clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than to kill people in large numbers.”

Americans have and use guns for a variety of reasons including hunting, range shooting, collecting, deterrence, and protection. In some cases, the guns that Biden refers to as “assault weapons” are more effective at activities like hog hunting than other types of firearms.

Additionally, those who use guns as self-defense tools are taught not “shoot to kill,” but only to shoot if necessary to stop, slow, or disarm someone who is threatening their life.

202. Biden Accuses Republicans of Suppressing Voters

“They are trying to succeed where they failed in 2020,” Biden said during a speech at Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 2, 2022. “To suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts. Instead of waiting until the election is over, or starting well before restarting now. They’ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It is estimated that the more than 300 election denier on the ballot all across America this year.”

In reality, it’s Democrats and Democrat operatives such as Marc Elias who oppose Republican-led election integrity laws around the nation and conservative attempts to make voting safer and more secure.

In Georgia, where Biden encouraged businesses to boycott the state over its “Jim Crow 2.0” election integrity law in 2021, early voters are turning out in record numbers. Even during early voting in the primaries, Georgia’s non-white voter turnout boomed.

201. White House Says Biden ‘Always Condemned Political Violence’

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a room full of corporate media reporters on Nov. 2, 2022, that Biden “has always, always condemned political violence.”

“It doesn’t matter, again, if you’re a Republican, an independent, or a Democrat,” Jean-Pierre said.

Biden has, however, failed to equally apply his condemnation of political violence.

When radical abortion activists violently attacked at least 75 life-saving pregnancy centers and pro-life groups, assaulted at least 89 Catholic churches, and threatened to harm Republican-nominated justices following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson opinion leak, Biden failed to personally address it.

Biden was also silent when climate rioters led an insurrection at the Department of the Interior in October 2021.

Even before his presidency, Biden neglected to quickly condemn the rioters, looters, and vandals who inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on the nation’s cities in 2020. It took Biden months to condemn those attacks. He was also silent when Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker, and Maxine Waters urged violence against Trump and his supporters.

200. Biden Says Incomes Outpaced Inflation Last Quarter

“Although it may not feel that way, people’s incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation. Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down,” Biden said during a gubernatorial campaign event for Charlie Crist in Florida.

While inflation was up a reported 8.2 percent in September, wages and salaries only increased by 5.1 and 4.2 percent since September of last year.

199. Biden Says He Attended HBCU

During a Democrat campaign event in Florida, Biden said he received his education at a historically black college or university, or HBCU.

“I’m a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University,” Biden told a cheering crowd.

While campaigning for @CharlieCrist in Miami-Dade County, @JoeBiden claims that he went to college at a HBCU (Historically Black institution) Delaware State University.

198. Biden Falsely Claims His Son Died in the Iraq War

Biden incorrectly claimed his son died in Iraq, presumably during the Iraq War.

“Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq. … Excuse me the war in Ukraine. I’m thinking of Iraq because that’s where my son died.”

Biden’s son Beau did die — but of brain cancer. Beau passed away in the United States in 2015, nearly four years after the end of the Iraq War in 2011.

197. Biden Says U.S. Has ‘Lowest Inflation Rate’ Globally

During a speech on Nov. 1, Biden incorrectly claimed the United States has “the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world.”

Biden: ""We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world."" pic.twitter.com/t1436gw0Qc — Greg Price (@greg_price11) November 1, 2022

As of September, the rate of inflation in the U.S. is 8.2 percent. Even though countries use different measures to calculate their inflation rates, the U.S. still had a larger increase in the cost of goods and services than many developed countries including Canada (6.9 percent), Japan (3 percent), Australia (7.3 percent), and Italy (5.79).

While many countries around the globe are suffering from price hikes, the U.S. inflation rate quadrupled, rising faster than Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Japan, India, China, and others

196. Biden Blames ‘Soaring’ Gas Prices on Putin (Again)

“Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in March sent gas prices soaring, literally, around the world. Not just here, but around the world,” Biden said in a speech on Nov. 1.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1587489793239310343?s=20&t=zoxuWsJKnzqcEUQyjGOuXg

The president claimed that it’s “because of the action we’ve taken since then, [that] gas prices have actually come down.”

Not only were gas prices “soaring” long before Russia’s leader chose to invade Ukraine, but Biden’s decision to deplete the Strategic Petroleum Reserve shortly before the midterms is a political one, not a sustainable one.

As Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote for The Federalist, Biden’s reliance on reserves is just an artificial and temporary solution for an ongoing problem.

“Should the SPR draws stop, or … shift back to refilling the reserves, what would happen? Oil prices would immediately spike, with gasoline prices following quickly,” DeVore wrote.

195. Biden Lies About Price of Gas

During an address on Oct. 27, Biden falsely claimed that gas prices were far higher when he took office than they are now.

“The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office,” Biden said.

Biden: ""The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office.""

Not only is the national average for gas currently hovering around $3.76 per gallon, not $3.39, but gas was only around $2.39 per gallon when Biden assumed office.

194. Biden Claims He ‘Signed a Law’ Wiping Student Loan Debt

Biden falsely claimed that his executive order shifting student loan debt onto taxpayers was actually a bill Congress passed and that he “signed” into law.

“It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two,” Biden said during a Now This presidential forum on Oct. 23.

Here is the full clip for all you clowns who say it’s out of context. Biden first falsely claims he “signed a law” to cancel student loan debt, then says he “got it passed by a vote or two.”



??????? pic.twitter.com/JKdKde24db — Jake Schneider (@jacobkschneider) October 24, 2022

Biden’s attempt to bail out Americans with college loans by making other debt-free Americans foot the bill is controversial and could, as the president himself once admitted, be illegal. That’s why a federal appeals court temporarily blocked Biden’s plans to shift student loan debt onto taxpayers on Oct. 21.

193. Biden Claims He Hasn’t ‘Stopped or Slowed U.S. Oil Production’

To defend releasing even more oil reserves, Biden lied that he has not “stopped or slowed U.S. oil production.”

“Let’s debunk some myths here. My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production,” Biden claimed. “Quite the opposite.”

Joe Biden:



""My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production."" pic.twitter.com/J85rmKhEl1 — TheBlaze (@theblaze) October 19, 2022

Oil production may technically be up from its pandemic plunge, but it’s still nowhere near the pre-Covid levels achieved under Biden’s predecessor — and any growth since then is not thanks to Biden. Even before he set foot in the White House, Biden declared a war on oil and fossil fuels. Once elected, the president used some of his first days in office to halt the Keystone Pipeline and effectively shut down public oil land leasing. He’s also tried to stop new oil projects and has threatened to eliminate the fossil fuel industry by 2050.

All of these actions have hiked gas and energy prices for Americans.

192. White House Says Fetterman Not Disabled

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at an Oct. 17 press conference Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. and Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was “just as capable as always” five months after a major stroke.

“The president has found him to be an impressive individual,” Jean-Pierre said, claiming Fetterman is “just as capable as always and who’s carrying out his office.”

Fetterman, however, still struggles to communicate and experiences issues processing what people say. The Democrat Senate nominee remains unable to speak clearly.

John Fetterman gave a speech in Montgomery County yesterday.



Here are the highlights. pic.twitter.com/8udMddHAcQ — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 12, 2022

In mid-October, a reporter for NBC News defended her coverage of a one-on-one interview with Fetterman wherein she claimed, “In small talk before the interview without captioning, it wasn’t clear he was understanding our conversation.”

Fetterman will require closed captioning for his debate with Republican celebrity television doctor Mehmet Oz. The debate will be held on Oct. 25 which is weeks after early voting in Pennsylvania has already begun.

191. Biden Lies About Effects Of Dobbs

During an address at a Democratic National Committee event on Oct. 18, 2022, Biden claimed that when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “Women all across the country, starting in my house, lost a fundamental right.”

Biden on Roe being overturned:

Not only is Jill Biden far beyond child-bearing age but many states have used the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, which gave states the power to decide abortion law, to expand their baby-killing radicalism.

Delaware, where the First Lady technically resides, allows abortion through “fetal viability,” which is considered between 24-26 weeks gestation.

190. Amid Recession, Biden Says Recession ‘Hasn’t Happened Yet’

In an attempt to cover up his role in exacerbating the nation’s economic crises, Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 11 that the U.S. is not in a recession.

“Should the American people prepare for a recession?” Tapper asked, shortly after Biden accidentally yet accurately called Democrats’ latest expensive spending package the “Inflation Act.”

“No,” Biden said. “Look they’ve been saying this now, every six months they say this. … It hadn’t happened yet. There’s no guarantee that they’re going to be a recess- I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, there will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly.”

Back-to-back negative quarters, which signal the U.S. is in a recession, were first reported in July. Not only did the nation’s gross domestic product drop by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, but inflation reached yet another record high, which severely damaged Americans’ purchasing power.

189. Biden Lies that He Lost an ‘Awful Lot’ of His Home to a Fire Years Ago

During a speech to Hurricane Ian victims on Oct. 5, 2022, Biden falsely claimed that he lost an “awful lot” in a 2004 kitchen fire at his Delaware home.

“I know from experience how much anxiety and fear concern is to other people. … We didn’t lose our whole home, but lightning struck and we lost an awful lot of it about 15 years ago,” Biden said.

Joe Biden claimed today that he lost ""an awful lot"" of his home in a fire from a lightning strike 15 years ago.



According to a report from the time, the lighting strike caused ""a small fire contained to the kitchen"" that ""was under control in 20 minutes."" https://t.co/l5l9eJ7MK3 pic.twitter.com/8yxvkUABPa — Greg Price (@greg_price11) October 5, 2022

According to the fire chief at the time, the fire, caused by a lightning strike, was contained in under 20 minutes.

Biden similarly told voters in New Hampshire in November of 2021 that his house burned down with First Lady Jill Biden inside of it.

“I know, having had a house burn down with my wife in it — she got out safely, God willing — that having a significant portion of it burn, I can tell: 10 minutes makes a hell of a difference,” Biden said.

188. Biden Claims Humans Make Hurricanes Worse

President Biden claimed Hurricane Ian was the firm proof of manmade climate change while touring the devastation in Florida on Oct. 5, 2022.

“I think the one thing this has finally ended is whether or not there is climate change and we should do something about it,” Biden said.

Data on hurricanes, however, only dates back about 100 years. Even President Barack Obama’s science adviser Steve Koonin said, “Humans have no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century.”

187. Biden Claims Roman Catholic Church Changed Position on Ending Unborn Lives

During remarks at the Democratic National Committee Reception on Sept. 22, Biden falsely claimed the Roman Catholic Church caved on allowing exceptions for abortions in the case of rape and incest.

“My generic point — and I happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic — my church doesn’t even make that argument now. And so we’re in a situation where things have changed a lot. But they’ve gotten more extreme in their positions,” Biden said.

While certain Catholic-identifying politicians such as Biden and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi regularly tout abortion, the Catholic Chuch still maintains that killing a baby, whose life began at conception, is a sin.

“Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,” paragraph 2271 of the Church’s Catechism states.

Even Pope Francis has publicly condemned Biden’s support for abortion as an “incoherence.”

186. Biden Pretends Inflation Isn’t Hurting Americans

During his “60 Minutes” interview with Scott Pelley on Sept. 18, Biden argued inflation is not as bad as it seems.

“Let’s put this in perspective,” Biden said. “Inflation rate month to month was up just an inch. Hardly at all.”

“You’re not arguing that 8.3 is good news?” Pelley asked, noting that the annual inflation rate for August was up 0.1 percent from July and more than 8 percent since the same time last year.

“No, I’m not saying it’s good news, but it was 8.2 or 8.2 before. You’re making it sound like all of a sudden, my God, it went to 8.2 percent,” Biden said.

As Pelley noted, “It’s been the highest inflation rate, Mr. President, in 40 years.” Americans are struggling to pay their grocery and energy bills, which have cost hundreds of extra dollars compared to previous years.

“I got that,” Biden retorted. “But guess what we are. We’re in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn’t spiked. It is just barely, it has been basically even.”

185. Biden Falsely Claims Energy Costs Came Down

In the same “60 Minutes” interview, Biden claimed energy prices have come down, but data for August inflation show energy costs are up 23.8 percent since August of 2021.

184. Biden Says His Expensive Spending Plans Will ‘Get Control of Inflation’

Moments after denying that inflation is spiking, Biden claimed that it’s his administration’s plans, including massive spending plans such as the misnomered Inflation Reduction Act, that will “get control of inflation.”

“Is the economy going to get worse before it gets better?” “60 Minutes” interviewer Pelley asked.

“No, I don’t think so. We hope, we hope we can have what they say a soft landing,” Biden said. “…I’m telling the American people that we are going to get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are going to be a hell of a lot lower. Their health care costs are going to be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody. Their energy prices are going to be lower.”

Despite Biden’s self-professed optimism about the economy, reports from financial analysts including those at the Congressional Budget Office say Democrats’ spending will make inflation over the next five years much worse, not better, as Biden and his party claimed.

183. Biden Repeats Civil Rights Activist Fib

During a Labor Day speech Biden claimed that, as a child, he became “very engaged in my case in the civil rights movement.”

“As a kid, I worked a lot in the movement,” Biden said.

Not only did Biden himself admit in 1987 that he was “not out marching” and “not down in Selma,” but even the media have repeatedly debunked Biden’s false assertions that he was “an activist.”

181. Biden Says Inflation Reduction Act Will Not Raise Taxes On Americans Earning Less than $400K

During an Aug. 16 signing ceremony for the Democrat Party’s $740 billion “Inflation Reduction Act,” Biden claimed that “no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes” once the legislation takes effect.

Biden’s assertion, however, runs contrary to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimates that Americans earning less than $400,000 a year “will pay an estimated $20 billion more in taxes over the next decade” as a result of the bill, “which also sets aside $80 billion to hire 87,000 IRS agents.”

180. Biden Says ‘Zero’ Inflation in July Following 8.5 Percent Rise

July’s consumer price index yielded a whopping 8.5 percent inflation increase since the same time last year, but according to Biden, July actually had no inflation whatsoever.

“I just want to say a number: zero,” Biden said in an address on Aug. 10. “Today, we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July. Here is what that means: While the price of some things went up last month, the price of other things went down by the same amount.”

Though the CPI figures were down slightly from the 9.1 percent recorded in June, the prices for everyday necessities such as groceries and electricity continue to shoot upward, with the latest numbers showing a 10.9 and 15.2 percent increase, respectively, since last year.

179. Biden Claims He Has Cancer

In a “climate crisis” speech about fossil fuels in Massachusetts on July 20, Biden incorrectly claimed that he has cancer caused by oil pollution in his home state. Biden said that growing up, pollution in Delaware was so bad that his mother had to use windshield wipers to “get literally the oil slick off the window.”

“That’s why I and so d-mn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer,” Biden said.

The White House physician quickly released a statement clarifying that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

The physician noted that Biden “has had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed” before.

178. Biden Pretends He Wrote Law Review Articles About Right to Privacy

During a speech about the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, Biden claimed he had written “a number of law review articles” about the right to privacy referenced in the now-overturned Roe v. Wade decision.

“And I have written, way back, a number of law review articles about the Ninth Amendment and the — and the 14th Amendment and why that privacy is considered as part of a constitutional guarantee. And the — they’ve just wiped it all out,” he said.

Biden may have helped pen close to 19 law review articles — and even flunked a law school class after plagiarizing portions of someone else’s law review article in one of his papers — but has never had a review published on the “right to privacy.”

As The Washington Post noted, the closest thing Biden has to a law review on the 14th Amendment is a 1991 opinion article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.

177. White House Silent on Biden’s Hunter Lies

When asked about Joe Biden’s voicemail indicating that he knew about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she could not “comment on any materials from [Hunter’s] laptop.”

Biden previously promised to “always level” with the American people but has repeatedly lied about his son’s financial activity despite copious evidence that he may have been involved in some of Hunter’s transactions.

176. Biden Lies About Billionaire Tax Rate

Biden tweeted that there are approximately 790 billionaires who are taxed at an average rate of 8 percent. He went on to claim that “I believe that no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, an electrician, or a cop.”

As Carol Roth, a former investment banker and economic commentator noted in a Twitter thread investigating the president’s claims, Biden’s assertion that billionaire tax rates are low is not only misleading, but it’s also false.

According to Roth, the study the White House used to determine what Biden claims is the billionaire tax rate does not rely on normal factors such as tax records and income. Instead, it included unsold stock.

“What they are using is not INCOME at all, it is stock appreciation, NOT realized. This is a made-up proxy of a wealth tax,” Roth tweeted.

As Roth noted in her analysis, “this is not how income tax works, and it is straight up a lie to say this an income tax rate for billionaires and portray it as an average tax rate of the ‘wealthiest.’”

Roth said the Biden administration intentionally “took a one time event and used it to compare to yearly taxes.”

175. Biden Repeats ‘Fastest-Growing Economy’ Lie

Biden told Jimmy Kimmel during a June 8 interview that the U.S. has the “fastest-growing economy in the world.”

Not only did the American economy shrink last quarter, but it is also plagued with record-high inflation and gas prices, a supply-chain crisis, and a baby formula shortage that has put several babies in hospitals.

174. Biden Says Trump Abused Constitutional Authority

During an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Biden agreed with accusations that Trump passed out executive orders “like Halloween candy.” He also accused the former president of abusing “the Constitution and constitutional authority” by issuing executive orders.

“I have issued executive orders,” Biden said after promising he wouldn’t issue executive action on guns, something he has already done. “But what I don’t want to do is emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and constitutional authority. I mean that sincerely because I often get asked — look, the Republicans don’t play it square, why do you play it square? Well, guess what. If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.”

While Biden blames Trump for what he says is an excessive amount of executive orders, the facts show Biden is on track to outpace the former president’s executive authority tally. During his first few months in office, Biden clocked more than 42 orders. Trump, on the other hand, issued 33.

173. White House Says Economy Is ‘In a Better Place’ Now than Historically

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in a press briefing on Tuesday that Biden’s administration believes “the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.”

Jean-Pierre: ""What we're trying to say is that the economy is in a better place than it has been historically."" pic.twitter.com/KIO61OnGNN — Greg Price (@greg_price11) June 7, 2022

Not only do voters reject this lie, but so do the facts. Inflation in the U.S. has reached record highs nearly every month recently as the supply-chain crisis and national staffing shortage drag on. Since Biden assumed office, gas prices have more than doubled.

There’s also a baby formula shortage that began when Biden’s Food and Drug Administration shut down a plant. It took months for the White House to address the critical crisis that left several young children and babies hospitalized.

172. White House Repeats Lie that Semiautomatic Gun Ban Decreased Mass Shootings

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated the lie that Congress’s 1994 semiautomatic gun ban decreased mass shootings.

“When he — when we talk about the executive actions that he’s taken — more than any president at this time of their administration — those are real steps that this president has taken. And not just as president, during his Senate years, in 1994, the banning of assault weapons; that is something that he led on,” she said during a press briefing on June 6. “And if we even look at what happened those first 10 years of that — of that assault [weapons ban] was in law — into law, it actually brought down mass shootings. And when it — when it expired in 2004, 10 years later, we saw mass shootings triple.”

A 2004 study funded by the Department of Justice, however, found that the Clinton-era ban was not the reason shootings decreased in the U.S.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

171. White House Says Biden Believes Excessive Federal Spending Helped Economy

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told members of the press on June 6 that Biden believes his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan actually helped the economy instead of contributing to its problems.

“I want to say the Rescue Plan has really been able to help us, put us in an economic, a place where we’re stronger. And … this is something that we have to really continue to remember, we are in an economic crisis. And the president met that moment by putting forth the American Rescue Plan, by Democrats on the Hill voting for that plan, and really putting us in a place where we look at today in a much stronger economic situation where we can actually deal with inflation head-on,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have a lot of work to do and we understand what the American people are feeling, but we are in a stronger place to take that on.”

It’s a repeat talking point from the administration but one that holds no water against record-high inflation and gas prices.

170. Biden Claims He Initiated Fastest Economic Recovery

During a speech on June 6, Biden claimed that “my plans have produced the strongest, fastest, most widespread economic recovery America has ever experienced.”

Biden also bragged about “record jobs, new record small businesses, and wages rising,” but he did not mention that inflation has far outpaced those hikes for months now. The president also did not mention that gas prices have more than doubled since he assumed office in January of 2021.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1533891641781764097?s=20&t=LeMTRb0AW6jh7sT01bHDAQ

Meanwhile, Americans deal with a prolonged supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising gas prices that the administration refuses to take responsibility for.

169. Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Have Blanket Immunity that Doesn’t Exist

President Biden claimed gun manufacturers enjoy blanket immunity on how their firearms are used.

“We should repeal the liability shield that all protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons,” Biden said in a gun speech on the evening of June 2. “They are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.”

BIDEN: Gun manufacturers ""are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity."" pic.twitter.com/OsmclOQyZx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) June 2, 2022

Biden’s claim, however, enjoys no merit. Suing a gun company for a gun that fires when the trigger is pulled is akin to suing the Coors Brewing Company because beer got people drunk.

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which became law in 2005, protects firearm manufacturers from liability for weapons used in a crime. Companies, however, may still be sued for negligence, breach of contract over gun purchases, and weapons defects.

168. Biden Says Deficit Cut Under Him Will Be Largest in History

“The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year – the largest reduction in history,” Biden wrote in his WSJ op-ed.

That’s a misleading claim, however, that doesn’t capture just how huge Biden’s budget deficit remains. History shows that this year’s $1 trillion deficit will be “the 7th worst on record.”

167. Biden Claims Economy Was Already Bad Before Covid-19

“Things should also look different from the decades before the pandemic, when too often we had low growth, low wage gains, and an economy that worked best for the wealthiest Americans,” Biden wrote in his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation.”

From 2017 to 2019 under Trump, however, GDP growth averaged 2.54 percent. Hourly earnings were also up 2.97 percent and outpaced the 2.13 percent inflation rate.

“In 2019, median household income saw its largest increase on record. The unemployment rate hit its lowest rate in nearly 50 years, poverty rates for all races were the lowest on record, and income inequality declined,” the America First Policy Institute determined.

166. Biden Repeats Putin Price Hike Lie

“The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas, and refining capacity are off the market,” Biden wrote in his inflation article in the Wall Street Journal.

Gas prices started rising long before the Russia Ukraine war. When Biden assumed office and waged a war on domestic oil and gas production by shutting down drilling and pipelines, gasoline prices rose significantly. From Biden’s inauguration to the week Russia invaded Ukraine, gas prices in the U.S. rose from $2.38 per gallon to $3.53 per gallon.

165. Biden Claims He Inherited ‘Stalled Economy’

Biden wrote in his inflation op-ed that “In January 2021, when I took office, the recovery had stalled.”

Shortly before Biden was inaugurated, however, the economy measured an annualized growth rate of 4.5 percent.

164. Biden Says Americans Are Better Paid Under His Administration

Biden claimed in his Wall Street Journal op-ed that “millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay” now that he is in office.

While earnings under Biden have risen 5.5 percent, real wages are down 2.8 percent and prices keep rising above the current 8.3 percent rate.

“The average American has lost about $1,350 in purchasing power from President Biden’s inflation tax,” the America First Policy Institute calculated.

163. Biden Claims He Initiated ‘Fastest Decline in Unemployment on Record’

In his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation,” Biden falsely claimed that his administration is responsible for “the fastest decline in unemployment on record.”

“The job market is the strongest since the post-World War II era, with 8.3 million new jobs, the fastest decline in unemployment on record, and millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay,” he wrote.

Records, however, show that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During that time period, the unemployment rate also declined 8.3 percent, which is 5.7 percent more than the fall measured under Biden’s watch.

162: Biden Repeats False Cannon Claim

Shortly before Biden signed an executive order on policing, he repeated his claim that when the Second Amendment was created, “You couldn’t own a cannon.”

“You couldn’t own certain kinds of weapons. There’s always been limitations,” he said while arguing in favor of more restrictions on Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms.

Not only were cannons legal when the Consitution was drafted, but they are also legal now. Revolutionary and Civil War-era cannons that don’t take a cartridge can be bought and sold as saluting and signaling devices in the United States. Certain modern artillery cannons that do take cartridges are classified as destructive devices and are legal and regulated under the National Firearms Act.

161: Biden Lies About Number of Times He’s Visited the Middle East

During his commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy in May, Biden claimed he has been to Iraq and Afghanistan “38 times.”

“I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 — I think 38 times,” Biden stated.

Not only did his own campaign confirm in 2019 that this was not true after the first time he stated this falsehood, but even The Washington Post fact-checked him on the erroneous claim.

Biden also implied that his son Beau Biden died in combat even though he passed away from cancer.

“My son spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal. I lost him,” Biden said.

160: Biden Says He Received Appointment to Naval Academy

Biden told graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy at their May commencement that he had received an appointment to attend the academy in 1965.

“Before I begin my speech, a thought crossed my mind as I was told the class of ‘72 is here. I was appointed to the academy in 1965 by a senator who I was running against in 1972,” Biden said. “Never planned it that way. I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in. I was only 29 years old when I was running. He was a fine man, and his name was J. Caleb Boggs.”

Biden went on to say that he declined to attend the academy “because I wanted to be a football star” and “you had a guy named Staubach and Bellino here.”

“So I went to Delaware,” he added.

Joe Biden falsely claimed he “was appointed to the [Naval] Academy in 1965” while speaking to Naval Academy graduates today.



Biden graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965, making that impossible. pic.twitter.com/oSTmjeqSLb — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) May 27, 2022

At the time described in Biden’s claim, however, the future president was graduating from the University of Delaware. The football players he mentioned as deterrents to his dream of being a football star had also previously graduated, Roger Staubach in 1965 and Joe Bellino in 1961.

159: White House Says Biden Came Up With ‘Ultra MAGA’ Label Himself

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed in a May 10 press conference that President Biden came with the “ultra MAGA” label to define his political opponents all on his own.

“It’s the president’s phrase, and the president made those comments himself,” Psaki said.

The Washington Post revealed on May 13, however, that the label is the product of a “six-month research project” by the left-wing group Center for American Progress Action Fund with former Harvey Weinstein apologist Anita Dunn.

158: Biden Says There Was No Vaccine Available When He Took Office

The White House claimed no coronavirus vaccine was available when President Biden took office in a May 12 tweet.

Operation Warp Speed however, a project to fast-track development for the pandemic disease, produced vaccines in record time. In fact, about 1.3 million Americans were given inoculations on Biden’s first day in office, surpassing the vaccination pace President Biden pledged of 100 million doses distributed in his first 100 days to mark another accomplishment of Donald Trump.

Biden even received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine before taking office.

157: Biden Claims Roaring Economy He Inherited Was On ‘Brink Of A Great Depression’

At a May 11 address in Chicago, President Biden portrayed himself the savior an economy nearing collapse, except the economy was on a rebound from the short-lived pandemic recession that lockdowns threatened to restrain.

“We had an economy on the brink of a Great Depression,” Biden said, despite the nation’s economy not contracting until a year into the president’s term.

According to data from the Department of Commerce, quarterly GDP remained positive until this year, when it decreased 1.4 percent in the first quarter. Real GDP growth under Biden’s first quarter in office was higher than it had been in at least three years as the economy recovered from Democrats’ shutdowns.

156: Biden Claims Vote To Block Abortion Bill Was Partisan. But Joe Manchin Also Voted No

President Biden condemned Republicans on May 11 for their unified rejection of an abortion guarantee written into federal law ahead of a potential decision from the Supreme Court to terminate Roe v. Wade as ruling precedent.

“Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care,” Biden said.

But West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, also rejected the bill.

Manchin explained his opposition to the bill on Capitol Hill.

“I respect people who support” it, Manchin said of the bill, which would prevent states from passing restrictions on abortions before fetal viability, and would further allow women to kill their unborn babies if a physician determined the baby was “a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health” — which could easily be interpreted to broadly include a variety of things under the banner of emotional health.

“Make no mistake. It is not Roe v. Wade codification,” Machin continued. “It’s an expansion. It wipes 500 state laws off the books.”

155: Biden Once Again Blames Inflation on Putin and Covid Pandemic

Inflation reached a four-decade high last month, but, contrary to what Biden said during a speech on economics, Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not chiefly to blame.

“There are two leading causes of inflation we’re seeing today,” Biden said. “The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century-pandemic … [and] a second cause: Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.”

BIDEN: ""There are two leading causes of inflation we're seeing today""

2) ""Mr. Putin's war in Ukraine""



MORE: https://t.co/IVmGxHlAWA pic.twitter.com/Hs1Zw0gmdH — NEWSMAX (@NEWSMAX) May 10, 2022

Inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

154: Biden Says Inflation Is His ‘Top Domestic Priority’

During an inflation speech, Biden claimed that tackling inflation is his “top domestic priority.”

“I want every American to know that I am taking inflation very seriously and it’s my top domestic priority,” Biden said.

Biden says he’s “taking inflation very seriously” but so far this week, his administration has been far more preoccupied with rejecting the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson draft opinion, which could see the court overturn Roe v. Wade, than soothing American consumers’ fears about a recession.

He also gave no indication that he plans to reinstate the American energy independence achieved under the Trump administration to lower gas prices, which rank as one of the highest inflation jumps each month.

153: Biden Said Robert Bork Thought Government Gave Americans Rights

Biden claimed Judge Robert Bork, the Supreme Court nominee he infamously torpedoed and smeared for his “original-intent judicial philosophy,” believed the government gives people rights.

“Bork believed the only reason you had any inherent rights was because the government gave them to you,” Biden said.

While Bork did appear to reject natural law as a guiding legal philosophy, he acknowledged its existence and never claimed to believe that inherent rights come from the government. Instead, Bork referred to rights in his confirmation hearings as something that could be transferred between parties but did not clarify how they were bestowed.

“What a court adds to one person’s constitutional rights, it subtracts from the rights of others,” Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois quoted Bork saying before asking whether Bork still believed that.

”Well, yes, Senator,” Bork said. ”I think it’s a matter of plain arithmetic.”

152: Biden Accuses ‘MAGA Crowd’ of Being ‘the Most Extreme Political Organization … in American History’

In a rant about the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization opinion signaling the end of Roe v. Wade, Biden accused the “MAGA crowd” of being “the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history,” before adding, “recent American history.”

Joe Biden says that overturning Roe v. Wade could lead to LGBT children not being allowed in school classrooms:



""This MAGA crowd is the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history."" pic.twitter.com/WyW6j52ju0 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) May 4, 2022

Biden failed to acknowledge that there are far more extreme and violent groups operating within the U.S., who have initiated deadly terrorist attacks on Americans, than the millions of people who voted for and support former President Donald Trump.

He also falsely suggested that the SCOTUS ruling on Dobbs would allow states to bar LGBTQ students from attending class with other students.

“If you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children. Is that legit under the way that the decision is written?” he asked.

There is no mention of LGBT children or classrooms in the Dobbs draft.

151: Biden Blames Putin for Months-Long, Record-High Inflation

Inflation reached a 40-year high last month, but Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not to blame, contrary to what Biden likes to suggest.

“I know that families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it. Let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high right now: COVID and Vladimir Putin,” Biden wrote in a tweet on April 20.

The truth is, inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

150: Biden Repeats Lie that Buying American Products Is a Priority

Despite his refusal to utilize the U.S. oil industry to achieve energy independence, Biden said buying American-made products is a priority for his administration.

“From Day One, every action I’ve taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle: Make it in America. That means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States of America,” the president tweeted.

Biden told a similar lie during his State of the Union address shortly after the White House defended buying at least $1.3 billion worth of Covid-19 rapid tests from China instead of U.S. manufacturers.

149: Biden Claims He Was A ‘Full Professor’ At The University Of Pennsylvania

Biden repeated a claim on April 14 that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, this time claiming “full” professorship despite his 2017-2019 tenure being an honorary position.

“For four years I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania,” Biden said during an event on supply chains in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Joe Biden says he was a ""full professor"" at UPenn.

Biden however, didn’t teach at the university, according to a spokesperson for the former vice president at the time he was hired.

The Daily Pennsylvanian headlined a piece ahead of Biden’s arrival, “No one is really sure what Joe Biden will be doing at Penn.”

According to the New York Post, Biden raked in more than $900,000 from the university despite rare appearances.

148: Biden Says You Couldn’t Buy Cannons When Second Amendment Passed

During his gun violence speech on April 11, Biden repeated the lie that cannons couldn’t be bought when the Second Amendment was ratified.

“You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment passed,” Biden claimed.

“You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment passed,” Joe Biden repeats — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 11, 2022

147: Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden said gunmakers are immune from prosecution even though manufacturers can be sued if a firearm is faulty or malfunctions.

“Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry,” Biden falsely claimed. “So they’ve never had to take responsibility for the death and destruction their products cause.”

BIDEN: ""Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry."" pic.twitter.com/2Qkz50AL2W — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 11, 2022

Biden also claimed that gun manufacturers are “the only outfit in the country that is immune,” even though many of the manufacturers who created the Covid-19 jab are immune to prosecution.

146: Biden Claims His Family Worried About Gas Prices As a Kid

“I grew up in a family like many of you where the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was discussed at the kitchen table,” Biden claimed.

But, as RealClearMarket’s John Tamny noted after Biden told a similar lie in February, Biden “was born in 1942. When Biden was growing up, the price of gasoline was flat. And it was cheap.”

A chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows the price of crude oil nearly flat from the 1880s until the 1970s — far after Joe Biden’s childhood.

145: Biden Says ‘Nothing’ Stopping Domestic Oil Production Even Though He Is

Biden said there’s “nothing standing in the way” of domestic oil companies ramping up production as gas prices skyrocket but his claims are far from the truth.

Even before he assumed office, Biden pledged to take down the domestic oil industry in favor of pushing his green agenda. This involved canceling the permits necessary for the Keystone XL pipeline, halting new oil and gas leases, and more recently, delaying permits for drilling on federal land.

144: Biden Falsely Claims Transgenderism Is ‘Safe and Healthy’

Biden told parents of children suffering from gender confusion that “affirming your child’s identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy.”

Despite Biden’s claims, encouraging young children to take hormone blockers, bind, or engage in other physically altering “treatments” or dangerous and risky procedures is not safe nor healthy. In addition to causing a myriad of harmful side effects including sterility, severe dysfunction, and other health problems, pushing children to embrace an identity different than their God-given sex often leads to transition regret as well as an exponentially higher risk of suicide.

143: Biden Says He Never Watched KBJ’s Confirmation Hearings

Biden told reporters that he “didn’t get a chance to see any of” Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings last week even though the White House said he did.

“The president watched portions of Judge Jackson’s hearing yesterday and today,” a White House staffer announced in a press briefing last week.

It is unclear if Biden simply forgot that he viewed the hearings or if the White House lied about how the president spends his time.

142: Biden Repeats ‘Very Fine People’ Lie to Smear Trump

During a press conference at the NATO summit in Belgium, Biden repeated the lie that Trump called the Charlottesville white nationalists “very fine people.”

It will always be funny to me when Biden says how Trump's ""very fine people on both sides"" line from Charlottesville was his inspiration to run for president.



The man literally began his presidential campaign on a lie. pic.twitter.com/hJlu8EDFCG — Greg Price (@greg_price11) March 24, 2022

Transcripts show that Trump’s “very fine people” line was in reference to the peaceful protesters on both sides who were civilly expressing their opinions about Confederate statues.

“But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,” Trump said.

Trump specifically said he was “not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,” but Biden still brings up the hoax on occasion.

141: Biden Says Unemployment Claims Down

Biden claimed that because unemployment claims are down because “our labor market is strong.”

Today we learned that the number of new unemployment claims is now lower than it was before the pandemic in 2019.



Our labor market is strong. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 17, 2022

The truth is, restaurants, hospitals, and businesses across the nation are struggling to stay open amid staffing shortages caused by an influx of federal cash. Record numbers of people left their jobs and even the labor market last year after multiple rounds of stimulus checks. Currently, more than 11 million jobs need to be filled and there aren’t enough workers willing to take those positions.

140: Biden Denies Cutting Off Domestic Oil Production

Shortly after he announced Russian oil would no longer be imported into the U.S., Biden claimed that he never stifled the U.S. oil and gas industry.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That is simply not true,” Biden insisted.

PANTS ON FIRE: Biden says some high gas prices could be b/c of price-gouging & it's a lie to say he's stifled domestic energy.

The truth is, Biden has done nothing but sabotage the U.S. oil and gas industry and replaced it with his green energy policy agenda. The president used his first year in office to wreck domestic production by suspending oil and gas leases, axing projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, canceling Arctic drilling leases, and pushing a cascade of taxes and regulation on the industry.

As a result, domestic gas prices were rising dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Painful prices at the pump have quickly become a sore spot for Americans, many of whom have indicated they’re looking for a change in the November midterms.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/08/heres-the-full-list-of-every-lie-joe-biden-has-told-as-president-part-three/,2022-03-08
How Biden’s Welfare Expansion Plans Undermine America’s Safety,"In his State of the Union message, President Biden may have mentioned the federal deficit, but he failed to discuss how years of inaction have jeopardized Americans’ retirement and their national security. Biden attempted to take credit for a budget deficit of “only” an estimated $1.2 trillion this fiscal year—a measure less of fiscal rectitude than his inability to jam his $5 trillion spending proposal through Congress last fall.

The real problem, and prime source of our more than $30 trillion in federal debt, comes from entitlements, and on that front, Biden offered only more new spending. The leader of a party who not long ago criticized Republicans for fighting two wars with three tax cuts now apparently wants to “reduce the deficit”—and fight the march of autocrats worldwide—by creating a new child care entitlement and expanding several others.

Debts Coming Due

Just as Vladimir Putin’s march on Kyiv finally forced many European countries to come to grips with over a decade of fecklessness in the wake of aggression, so too could the United States soon face the consequences of its long inaction on debt and deficits. The ramifications could undermine America’s ability to project its strength on the global stage.

In many ways, Obamacare lies at the root of this problem; its financial legerdemain has empowered politicians to ignore our entitlement crisis for more than a decade. The year prior to the law’s passage, Medicare’s trustees projected the program would become insolvent in 2017—five years ago. But because government accounting allowed Democrats to count Medicare spending reductions as both funding Obamacare and improving the Medicare trust fund, the law magically extended Medicare’s insolvency by a decade—if only on paper.

This gimmick enabled lawmakers of both parties to avoid the hard choices necessary to make America’s entitlements, and our long-term fiscal situation, sustainable. President Biden’s remarks last week demonstrate his head remains firmly in the sand. In a nearly 6,500 word speech, he mentioned Medicare only twice—neither in the context of solvency or reform—and Social Security not at all.

Biden’s entitlement reform proposals, such as they are, consist primarily of closing a tax loophole—one that he and his wife spent the past four years exploiting, to avoid nearly $400,000 in Medicare taxes—and re-directing those funds to yet more new spending. In amplifying Obamacare’s fiscal gimmicks and dishonesty to justify additional entitlements, the soon-to-be octogenarian president is showing little regard for his fellow seniors’ financial futures.

Growing Pressures on the U.S. Budget

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts the need for structural fiscal reform in even starker relief. America’s defense spending has fallen by nearly a third as a percentage of GDP, from 4.7 percent in 2010 to 3.3 percent this fiscal year, with a further drop projected in the coming years. Germany’s shock decision to increase its defense budget by €100 billion—with more to follow—in the wake of the invasion illustrates the hard fiscal choices lawmakers will have to make yet Biden has avoided.

In addition, the pricing pressures arising from the invasion, in the form of higher costs for energy and other goods, will exacerbate the problems of a Federal Reserve already behind the curve in fighting inflation. Hemmed in by a year of indecision and the pressures of the Ukrainian conflict, the Fed could have to tighten monetary policy further and faster, raising interest costs to the Treasury and increasing the possibility of a recession.

In July, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that borrowing costs to the federal government would rise to nearly $1 trillion by the end of the decade, more than doubling as a share of GDP from 1.3 percent to 2.7 percent and nearly eclipsing the entire defense budget. But those estimates assumed that inflation would remain under relative control, and the Federal Reserve would not start raising interest rates until “late 2023.” Subsequent events have rendered those predictions inaccurate, meaning CBO’s projection of $5.4 trillion in net borrowing costs over the coming decade could prove an underestimate.

Debt Is a National Security Issue

Biden believes he can carry on the left’s goals of creating “free” new entitlements for the American people. But all this “free” spending is undermining America’s financial freedom. Our existing obligations have already raised our debt to more than 100 percent of GDP, compared to Russia’s 18 percent. And rather than using the Ukraine invasion as an opportunity to call for sacrifice—to finally get our financial house in order—Biden instead proposed a spending blowout without end.

Over a decade ago, Admiral Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the federal debt our biggest national security threat. If Biden really wants to protect and defend the United States from growing threats overseas, he should act accordingly.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/08/how-bidens-welfare-expansion-plans-undermine-americas-safety/,2022-03-08
"To Punish Putin, US Firms Develop Social Credit System He'd Be Proud Of","American institutions are taking anti-Russian sanctions into their own hands, further normalizing a financial social credit system that can ostracize users for holding unacceptable beliefs — a move purported to punish Russia but that actually evokes the authoritarian country’s own system of tracking its citizens’ political views.

Visa and Mastercard have suspended operations in Russia over the country’s invasion of Ukraine, blocking “cards issued by Russian banks from working in other countries and block[ing] people with cards issued elsewhere from purchasing goods and services from companies in Russia.” American Express has also dropped its Russian operations. Meanwhile, tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have ceased sales of their products in the country.

It could be tempting to cheer the move for targeting Russia’s authoritarian regime and condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked attacks on the people of Ukraine. But the actions by private companies against Russians are part of a larger swing by U.S. corporations to deny services to those whose opinions they deem unacceptable — and that’s exactly the kind of social credit system Russia is building to impose on its own people.

(12) You think this western (WEF/NATO) compliance and financial gateway system they are establishing for all of us would not be fully supported by Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping?



Ha. Of course, they would. It mirrors their same system. And we are doing it to ourselves. 😲 pic.twitter.com/r1W9eFf8vs — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) March 6, 2022

Moscow will use “digital profiles” to track citizens’ “loyalty,” according to a Moscow Times 2020 report. “Moscow City Hall has since 2017 been collecting the gender, age, income level and relationship to other people signed up to its mos.ru website as part of the internet activity monitoring system,” the report notes. “The digital profiles will now include information about Muscovites’ violations, fines, debts and participation in various events, according to the cited documentation.”

Lest you think the system is limited to the capital city, Russian officials have said that 80 percent of Russians will have such a digital profile by 2025 through the government’s $53 billion Digital Economy Program.

And now, with Visa and Mastercard cutting ties, Russian banks are turning to China — a country with an even more invasive social credit system. The Chinese Communist Party tracks its people’s economic decisions and even things like being a good or bad driver to reward or punish behavior.

Punishment might include anything from slower internet speeds to being barred from flying or staying in certain hotels. There have also been reports of people being denied higher education and having their pets confiscated.

If you think comparisons between Russia and China’s authoritarian credit systems and the increasing dragnet in the United States are outlandish, just think about how Mastercard and American Express blocked donations to Americans whose beliefs about the 2020 election were found unacceptable, while Visa’s political action committee used the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021 to “temporarily suspend[] all political donations.” Paypal, Venmo, and Shopify all went after people who were supposedly involved in the riot.

Just last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cracked down on truckers who were protesting Covid mandates, freezing hundreds of bank accounts purported to be associated with the peaceful protest. Crowdsourcing fundraising platform GoFundMe confiscated millions of dollars from protest organizers.

Previously, GoFundMe suspended a fundraising campaign for Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges after he shot three men in self-defense. The platform also used the Jan. 6 riot to nix fundraisers for “travel to a political event where there’s risk of violence by the attendees,” and those that “spread misinformation about the election, promote conspiracy theories and contribute to or participate in attacks on U.S. democracy.”

Meanwhile, Big Tech companies use their powers of censorship to shut down users whose speech is deemed unacceptable, and to nuke alternative platforms from app stores.

We shouldn’t cheer U.S. firms for appointing themselves the arbiters of who deserves to participate in our economy (and by extension, our society). If they can do it to Russia, they can do it to you.

But we also shouldn’t cheer such actions because they move us one step closer to blurring the line between ourselves and the authoritarian tyrants we purport to denounce. If we defeat Russia or China by making our differences unrecognizable, we’ve already lost.

Biden Set To Give Up Even More Leverage In Disastrous Iran Deal 2.0,"With the world’s attention understandably distracted by the Ukrainian conflict, it is easy to forget that the Biden administration is currently renegotiating the Iran Deal that former U.S. President Barack Obama made in 2015, and which President Joe Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled out of in 2018.

Even though a Russian envoy told Reuters over the weekend that “we will have a deal maybe in the middle of next week,” the Vienna discussions to renegotiate the terms of the 2015 agreement, which have been taking place since April 2021, were thrown into jeopardy last Sunday.

Russia has been accused of trying to take the deal hostage as part of its conflict with the West over Ukraine. They fear that their economic trade with Iran will be affected by U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.

The Guardian reports that America will almost certainly reject the demand that Russian-Iranian trade be exempt from sanctions since it would open a massive loophole in the sanctions regime. It would then be up to Russia whether to veto the deal altogether. This could be a blessing in disguise because the pact the Biden administration is negotiating with Iran represents a huge capitulation.

The intentions behind the original 2015 Iran Deal sound good on paper. When the Obama administration negotiated it that year, the pact’s purpose was to limit the country’s nuclear program to make it harder for Iran to obtain fissile material for a nuclear bomb in return for relief from economic sanctions. Managing Partner of Atieh International Bijan Khajehpur stated the deal would trigger economic growth, as 20 percent of Iran’s problems were related to sanctions prior to 2015.

During the Trump administration, the Iranian government deployed new technology to enrich its uranium supplies in 2019, a clear breach of the Iran Deal. Thanks to Israeli exposure of the Iranian nuclear archive in 2018, it became clear that Iranian Supreme Leader Hassan Rouhani was always serious about his nation eventually acquiring nuclear weapons. Therefore, Trump was right to have concerns about the Iran Deal and that is why he scrapped it in 2018.

That is because the 2015 agreement failed to curb the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s ongoing support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah, which made permanent peace between the United States and Iran unlikely due to Lebanon’s attacks on Israel. Plus, the Iran Deal only delayed the country’s nuclear program.

Despite this, the Trump administration should have implemented French President Emmanuel Macron’s four-point plan that would see a lifting of all U.S. sanctions in exchange for an end to Iran’s destabilizing activities in the Middle East and its nuclear ambitions. This means that Trump’s failure to replace Obama’s agreement with something better led to the backdrop of today’s indirect discussions between America and Iran.

Now the Biden administration is on the verge of signing a deal far worse than the one Obama did almost seven years ago. Under the terms of the U.S. President’s revised pact, the Revolutionary Guard will be removed from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list. This gives them a free pass to continue with their destabilizing activities in the Middle East. Not even the Obama administration would have been happy with such a provision.

Furthermore, Iran’s current President, Ebrahim Raisi, will have his human rights-related sanctions removed. The reason why Raisi was sanctioned by Trump in 2019 was because he was responsible for the 1988 extra-judicial murders of some 5,000 people. In addition, he initiated the violent 2009 crackdown on the Green Revolution, which was triggered by a staged presidential election. Such a decision only legitimizes Raisi’s international presence and shows that the Biden administration did not issue enough red lines during the Vienna negotiations.

The Biden administration has not only capitulated to Iran, but to Russia as well. Removing Yemeni Iranian Houthis from the FTO list last March was a major concession to drag Iran back to the negotiating table but at the expense of allowing the Houthis to continue to implement terrible atrocities in Yemen.

The removal of the Nord Stream 2 sanctions was a concession to persuade the Russians to remain involved in the Vienna negotiations. Yet they were reimposed following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. As a result, the Biden administration’s goodwill toward Moscow backfired badly.

Russia and China are the only two countries that would benefit from these negotiations – China because they will continue to trade with Iran, and Russia because they will have a client state in the Middle East. Biden has appeased these three nations at the expense of increasing the terrorist threat to the U.S., and by emboldening Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Middle Eastern ambitions.

The United States cannot afford to appease totalitarian dictatorships. As Trump’s former national security advisor for the Middle East, Victoria Coates, said, they need to apply more leverage over the Iranian hovernment. At the same time, they need to return to the principles of Macron’s four-point plan to end Iran’s nuclear program completely. Sadly, the Biden administration has shown no willingness to adopt Macron’s vision, and the United States will lose as a result.

How Pre-War Expectations Shape War: France 1940 And Ukraine 2022,"Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, experienced military analysts and pundits expressed a wide range of opinions about Russia’s military capabilities and Ukraine’s ability to effectively resist.

Through the 20-20 vision of those viewing the recent past, it’s clear that most analysts overestimated Russian capacities and underestimated Ukrainian ability to resist. This shouldn’t be a surprise. Warfare is complex and thankfully rare enough that forecasting outcomes are more fraught for the analysts than is predicting sporting matchups or election outcomes.

One example from history illuminates the challenge. When the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries on May 10, 1940, many experts predicted a stalemate, not unlike that of World War I — a short German advance followed by bloody trench warfare.

The French had prepared for the conflict, building a mighty system of defensive fortifications known as the Maginot Line on their frontier with Germany. France did so largely in reaction to the very severe losses they suffered in the opening stages of WWI when their “Attaque à outrance” (Attack to excess) doctrine resulted in massive casualties and little to show for it in the face of machine guns and modern artillery.

In the harsh winter of 1939-40, the French feverishly worked to extend their line of fortifications, but the weather was so cold, the concrete they poured crystalized, rendering it ineffective against German artillery. Even so, as the Germans invaded, their army only outnumbered Allied forces by a scant margin: 3,350,000 troops to 3,300,000.

The Allies had an almost 2:1 superiority in artillery — 7,378 for the Germans, 13,974 for the Allies. In the air, the Germans had an almost 2:1 advantage, 5,638 to 2,935. Lastly, in tanks, the decisive battle system, the Allies seemingly had an advantage, with the Germans possessing 2,445 tanks to the Allies 3,383 or more.

Yet, only six weeks after the German invasion, Allied armies were wrecked or surrendered, with the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France all having capitulated. What happened?

In retrospect, the German victory was due to a few small things that all but a few Western analysts such as Britain’s B. H. Liddell Hart could foresee. For instance, French tanks were well-armored but slow. They also featured one-man turrets, overwhelming tank commanders by the need to fire their own guns and command at the same time.

Radios in tanks were also in short supply in the French army. Further, German doctrine called for the joint employment of infantry, armor, and air power. The result was a rapid German advance over a ponderous Allied military.

In some ways, the Russian assault on Ukraine appears to suffer from the near opposite of the pre-war expectations in 1940. Russia was widely anticipated to roll over Ukrainian resistance. There are a few reasons this has been the case.

Russia’s Miscalculations

First, the Russians vastly underestimated the determined resistance the Ukrainians would offer. As a result, they sized their force and planned their initial assault to rapidly topple the government in Kyiv with minimal damage to either side. When that didn’t happen, they had no Plan B.

Second, Russian planners were overconfident in the fighting prowess and morale of the conscripts that make up significant portions of their combat units. Whether to preserve operational security or due to cultural disregard for sharing information to the average soldier, Russians appear to have been largely mentally unprepared for the coming fight.

Third, Russian planners ignored their own meteorological history insofar as the perils of the mud season known as Rasputitsa. Normally, a month or two in the spring and fall, Rasputitsa notoriously turns the Russian and Ukrainian countrysides to vast stretches of mud that make cross-country movement off improved roads all but impossible. There was never a hard freeze in Ukraine this winter, meaning Rasputitsa never ended — making Russian forces more road-bound than is tactically advisable.

Fourth, Ukraine learned a lot from its sharp defeat at the hands of the Russians in 2014 in the Donbas Basin to the east and in Crimea. Under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, the Ukrainian military underwent an extensive effort to retool and reform, rooting out corruption and revising doctrine. These efforts have paid off handsomely on the battlefield.

These factors and others are likely to lead to a long struggle in Ukraine. Images of hastily requisitioned civilian vehicles emblazoned with the now-infamous “Z” on Russian flatbed rail cars suggest the Russian government is unable to muster sufficient logistics support for its stalling effort.

NATO Shouldering the Burden

Similarly, Western powers and Ukraine need to prepare for the likelihood of a drawn-out war. This means high-volume consumables such as shoulder-fired anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles need to be replenished immediately by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially given the worldwide chip shortage.

Further, provisions should be made for repairing and refurbishing the vast amount of military equipment that has been damaged or captured in this conflict but that might otherwise be returned to use. This could be done in NATO nations adjacent to Ukraine and might be a useful way to employ additional volunteers wanting to help Ukraine who are skilled in maintenance but otherwise not fit for combat. Such a capability would also be useful in allowing the gathering and return to the operational status of old Soviet bloc equipment from the dozens of nations around the world that might be purchased or donated.

If this war turns into a contest of attrition, then Western economic sanctions will eventually degrade the Russian economy’s ability to support the war effort, potentially moderating Russian demands for Ukrainian territory or disarmament. To be clear, a long war will be devastating for Ukrainian civilians and destabilizing for nations hosting large refugee populations. But the damage to Russian power, especially in the long term, may even be greater.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/09/how-pre-war-expectations-shape-war-france-1940-and-ukraine-2022/,2022-03-09
Press Wield Biden's Russia Excuses To Gaslight Americans About Gas,"The propaganda press is wielding the Biden administration’s excuses about Russia to gaslight Americans about skyrocketing prices at the gas pump.

Despite the fact that domestic gas prices rose dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden and his team refuse to take responsibility for rising costs at gas stations. When the price of gas shot up nearly 50 cents more per gallon this week, the White House scrambled to set a narrative that once again exonerated the Biden administration from a self-inflicted crisis that could hurt Democrats in the 2022 midterms.

“It’s going to go up,” Biden claimed on Tuesday shortly after he halted Russian oil imports to punish Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. “Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible.”

Biden on gas prices:



""It’s going to go up. Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible."" pic.twitter.com/7S3Z7GMxoP — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) March 8, 2022

“Putin’s war is already hurting Americans at the gas pump,” Biden added in a press conference. “Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders … the price at the gas pump in America went up 75 cents. … I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also lied about the effects Biden’s poor energy policy has had on Americans, blaming the Russian-Ukraine conflict for rising gas prices. “The increase,” she said, “is a direct result of the invasion of Ukraine.”

One day later, the corrupt media predictably latched onto this convenient narrative in their own coverage of the record-high gasoline price spike.

“‘Putin’s price hike’ will be borne by American consumers,” ABC News tweeted, echoing the Biden administration’s talking points.

""Putin's price hike"" will be borne by American consumers. https://t.co/u85agBu06n — ABC News (@ABC) March 9, 2022

Outlets such as CNN smeared Republicans for pointing out Biden’s obvious role in exacerbating the country’s energy troubles and making Americans pay for his ignorance.

“[Republicans] largely ignored the global factors left over from the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine that are weighing on gasoline costs,” CNN claimed. “And they accused Biden of leaving Americans vulnerable to energy shocks overseas by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada when he first took office. They claimed he doomed Americans to high gasoline prices by pausing oil and gas leases on public lands and by suspending oil leases in Arctic refuges to fight climate change.”

Politico claimed that “they have also used the topic to criticize Biden for limiting domestic oil and gas production that they argue can fill the gap created by a Russian import ban.”

Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell also recently accused the GOP of “laying a trap for Biden on Russian energy sanctions.”

MSNBC and NBC also jumped at the opportunity to pile on Republicans instead of indicting Biden for his policy failures.

“Republicans cheer Russian oil ban and jeer Biden for rising gas prices,” NBC reporters Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong wrote.

Next phase to watch from Republicans:

– many pushed for russian oil ban. Will they work with WH to find way to pump more fast and ease economic burden on consumers? OR cheer on higher prices / blaming Biden for inflation? — Stephanie Ruhle (@SRuhle) March 8, 2022

The truth is, Biden has played an explicit role in limiting the U.S. oil industry but the corrupt media are conveniently ignoring his track record when they cover rising prices at the pump.

On his first day in office, Biden nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Over the last year, the president has also canceled Arctic drilling leases, rained down taxes and regulation on domestic production, and publicly declared war on oil and gas.

Instead of turning to domestic production to fill the hole left by Russian imports, Biden is considering buying oil from other corrupt pro-Moscow regimes.

CNN, ABC, The Washington Post, and other corporate media outlets aren’t mentioning the president’s anti-oil agenda in their coverage of expensive gas. Instead, most of them are refusing to mention him at all but they are happy to use the White House’s talking points.

Since before Biden assumed office, corrupt outlets have tried to absolve him of any blame for crises he created. The drastic jump in gas prices after Biden waged a war on oil and gas, unfortunately, is no exception.

Media Narrative About Biden's Strong NATO Leadership Is Imploding,"Not to be impatient, but weren’t we told for the past two weeks that NATO had proven to be a united force, resolute in confronting Vladimir Putin. And wasn’t this largely to the credit of President Joe Biden’s stalwart leadership?

If that’s true, someone’s going to have to explain why Biden asked Poland to send fighter jets to Ukraine, only to be effectively told, “No, you do it.”

The Biden administration had been seeking a deal wherein Poland would send Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine and in return, the U.S. would supply Poland with a more modern fleet of aircraft. Apparently uninterested in making a move that might further agitate Russia, Poland, like an annoying office colleague, made a passive-aggressive attempt to shift the responsibility.

The country’s minister of foreign affairs, without consulting Secretary of State Tony Blinken, released a statement Tuesday agreeing to a different deal that the U.S. hadn’t even proposed — to send the jets to an American military base in Germany, where we could then send them to Ukraine ourselves. (The minister even said Poland would do it “free of charge”!)

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby responded with another statement: “We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.”

It’s an episode straight out of “Veep.” Finger-pointing and quibbling over who’s going to be the one to execute. Go NATO!

Don’t worry, though. Vice President Kamala Harris was well on her way to Poland. That should fill you with utmost confidence, because “it is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day. Every day, it is time for us to agree that there are things and tools that are available to us to slow this thing down.”

This comes right after the national media assured us that Biden had been supremely effective in stupefying Putin by corralling our Western allies in a unified front of crippling economic sanctions and embargoes.

As the New York Times wrote on Feb. 24: “In his two televised addresses this week, Mr. Biden displayed the resolution and calm of a tested leader, and the Western alliance demonstrated a rare unity in the face of Russia’s attack.”

“Mr. Biden, for his part, has managed this crisis with toughness, patience, resolve and dignity. … Mr. Putin should see that this is the resolute face of the world’s premier democracy and most powerful nation,” the Times wrote just one day prior.

On Feb. 21, the paper said: “Mr. Putin also seemed to overlook that Western democracies and the Western alliance, whatever their problems, remained capable of uniting against a common threat, and of joining together to threaten him and his country with debilitating economic and social damage.”

That’s not to root against the West in this mess, but it would be nice to know that we’re getting a realistic account of the state of play. Then the public can set its expectations and determine just how far we’re willing to go in making the foreign conflict our problem. God knows this country has enough on its hands without being fed the wrong impression that Biden and the rest of NATO are on the same page.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/09/the-media-narrative-about-bidens-strong-nato-leadership-is-predictably-imploding/,2022-03-09
The U.S. And NATO Have No Strategy To Aid Ukraine And Defeat Russia,"A remarkable exchange took place earlier this week between the United States and Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine and likely would be first to get hit by Russian forces if the war expands beyond Ukrainian territory. The exchange was not only embarrassing, highlighting the U.S. State Department’s incompetence, but it underscores what can only be described as a complete absence of strategy among the NATO allies, which appear to have no end-game and no off-ramps in mind for Ukraine and Russia.

Here’s what happened. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Sunday that Poland has a “green light” to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force, adding that the U.S. was working with Poland to find a way to replace MiG-29 jets (which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly and fight) that might be sent to Ukraine with American F-16s.

News quickly spread on Monday that the U.S. and Poland had reached such a deal, and that dozens of Polish MiG-29s were in fact going to supplement Ukraine’s war effort. If true, that would have been a shocking escalation on the part of NATO. It’s easy to see how Russia could then claim that Poland, by putting its own warplanes in the fight, was now a belligerent in the conflict, and then justify expanding the war into Eastern Europe.

But it wasn’t true — not quite. Poland, acutely aware of what Moscow’s likely response would be if dozens of Polish warplanes flown by Ukrainian pilots crossed from Poland into Ukraine and started hitting Russian targets, issued a curious statement on Tuesday. The Polish Foreign Ministry said it was ready to deploy, free of charge, all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, “and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.”

The statement went on to request that the U.S. “provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies — owners of MIG-29 jets — to act in the same vein.”

This move by Poland apparently caught the U.S. State Department completely off-guard. Later on Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby responded to the Polish proposal, which he said, “shows just some of the complexities this issue presents.”

The prospect of fighter jets “at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America” departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance. It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.

What can we conclude from this bizarre back-and-forth? First, that Blinken’s “green light” comment Sunday was made without consulting Poland or our other NATO allies. Second, that Poland’s statement Tuesday was a not-too-subtle attempt to shift the responsibility for the entire scheme to the United States. Essentially, Poland was saying that if the U.S. government wants to aide Ukraine by giving it warplanes, Poland would not be the one to transfer or even facilitate the transfer of those aircraft onto the battlefield. They would have to come from a U.S. air base, not Poland.

Lastly, the U.S. response reveals that despite Blinken’s reckless comment, the U.S. has not thought seriously about how any of this would work, and what might or might not give Moscow a casus belli to attack Polish or NATO targets in Eastern Europe.

In other words, there is no NATO strategy, either to assist Ukraine in a way that would turn the tide of the war or to imagine an end-game that’s something less than a total Russian defeat. Last week, Blinken articulated what can best be described as a maximalist policy for the war: “We have to sustain this until it stops, until the war is over, Russian forces leave, the Ukrainian people regain their independence, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity. We’re committed to doing that.”

So the apparent position of the U.S. government is that it must help Ukraine to bring about a complete humiliating Russian withdrawal, something like the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 — or the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, for that matter. If the NATO allies are worried that Russia will widen the war over a couple dozen Polish MiG-29s, what do they think the Kremlin will do to avoid the kind of defeat that Blinken has laid out? Have they thought about the possibility that Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons to avoid that kind of defeat? It sure doesn’t seem like it.

Setting all that aside, though, the U.S. and our NATO allies have just demonstrated to Russia and the entire world that we have no plan to provide Ukraine with warplanes, let alone tanks or troops or other advanced weapon systems. The NATO allies obviously don’t even agree on how that might be done in theory, and they apparently are not talking to one another about it behind closed doors but issuing embarrassing and contradictory statements in public.

As my colleague Eddie Scarry notes, all of this blows up the polite fiction that President Joe Biden is providing strong NATO leadership, and that the alliance is solid and united in confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

It also blows up the notion, increasingly popular among neocons in the corporate press and in Washington, that NATO is able to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine and can be pressured into doing so. If the Poles won’t even allow its MiG-29s to be transferred to Ukraine via Polish airspace, why would they agree to send sorties out from Poland to engage and shoot down Russian warplanes? Why would smaller NATO allies in the Baltics?

They won’t — and they shouldn’t, because doing so would be an act of war that would pull the entire NATO alliance into an armed conflict with Russia. Likewise, funneling warplanes and other heavy weapons into Ukraine will bring NATO right up to and arguably well past the line of belligerence. To paraphrase the Pentagon, the proposal is not a tenable one.

We Knew From His Campaign Joe Biden Would Set Foreign Policy On Fire,"American voters usually prioritize domestic issues over foreign policy during presidential elections. But several major blunders just in President Biden’s first year show the danger of not closely scrutinizing presidential candidates’ records on foreign policy.

During the 2020 election, foreign policy-related questions barely came up in any of the debates between President Donald Trump and Biden. The presidential debate commission in fact pulled foreign policy from their debate topics, perhaps to hide Biden’s weakness.

A YouGov survey in 2020 showed that 77 percent of Americans believed domestic issues were more important than foreign policy when choosing the next U.S. president. Additionally, people may have assumed foreign policy was Biden’s strong suit, since he was a U.S. senator for three decades and vice president under President Obama for eight.

Such an assumption couldn’t be further from the truth. Robert Gates, a defense secretary in the Obama administration, said Biden has “been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”

Trump Was the Clear Foreign Policy Champ

In contrast, foreign policy was one of the bright spots in the Trump presidency. He orchestrated the historical Abraham Peace Accords among Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. His pivot to the Indo-Pacific was far more successful than President Obama’s pivot to Asia initiative.

Under Trump, the United States took a hard line on China, improved its relationship with India (the only Asian power that could check China), and expanded cooperation with allies by establishing the Quad, an unofficial alliance with Australia, India, and Japan. However, since most corporate media were anti-Trump, few wanted to give him any credit for his foreign policy accomplishments.

Instead, major media criticized Trump for being “soft” on Russia for his entire presidency. After Trump left the office, Fareed Zakaria of CNN finally admitted, “the Trump administration was pretty tough on the Russians. They armed Ukraine. They armed the Poles. They extended NATO operations and exercises in ways that even the Obama administration had not done.”

The combination of low public interest in foreign policy and a media that was willing to do everything to get Biden elected resulted in little scrutiny of Biden’s extensive foreign policy failures.

Joe Biden Botched Things From His First Day

During his campaign, Biden promised the American people that he would “go toe-to-toe” with Russia. But just within his first 48 hours in office, Biden delivered two gifts to Russia.

First, he rescinded the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would have created tens of thousands of jobs for American workers and delivered 830,000 barrels of oil daily from Canada. The cancellation of Keystone was the first of a series of the Biden administration’s “war on fossil fuel” policies that have strangled the U.S. energy industry and ended U.S. energy independence.

Biden’s energy polices not only hurt American workers and the American economy, but also had foreign policy repercussions. His policies caused gas price inflation, and provided Vladimir Putin the financial resources to cause nuisance worldwide, including invading Ukraine.

Biden’s second gift to Putin was to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, with Russia for another five years without fixing the treaty’s many flaws. For example, it doesn’t limit Russia’s capacity to pursue nuclear weapons outside the treaty. And China isn’t part of the agreement, even though China has been rapidly building its nuclear weapon capacity.

On Iran, rather than taking advantage of the leverage gifted by the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” economic sanctions, Biden jumped right back to the disastrous 2015 nuclear deal. His appointment of Robert Malley as his special envoy to Iran — a man with a long history of sympathy to Iran’s authoritarian regime and overtly anti-Israeli sentiments — signals that appeasement is now U.S. foreign policy.

Groveling Before China and Russia

China is the most significant strategic rival of the United States, and the Biden administration’s China policies are full of contradictions. It extended some of the Trump administration’s policies, such as adding Chinese companies to an economic blacklist over alleged human rights violations and imposing a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Yet Biden’s secretary of state refused to call China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims a “genocide,” and the U.S. Department of Justice quietly shut down its China-focused anti-espionage investigation.

The first sign of how Biden’s domestic policy would affect his foreign policy occurred during a high-level Sino- U.S. meeting in Alaska in March 2021. Biden and his team have often publicly criticized the United States, and through an executive order, Biden promised to address systemic racism in the country. China’s diplomats employed that same rhetoric to dress down American diplomats and attack America’s moral leadership in Alaska. The U.S. diplomats couldn’t mount a strong rebuttal because Democrats believe it.

All these were early warning signs that Biden’s foreign policy would end up empowering America’s adversaries at our expense. Then came the Biden administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. It revealed how incompetent and unfocused the Biden administration is. After it, Biden’s approval rating dropped 8 percent.

Americans don’t like to see our military and government humiliated by a group of ragtag militants. We were distraught over the loss of 13 American soldiers during the withdrawal. America’s embarrassing retreat from Afghanistan emboldened adversaries from Moscow to Beijing to Tehran to achieve their aggressive geopolitical goals.

Now Comes Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine

Biden’s poor handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a perfect example of how one foreign policy failure led to another and Biden’s domestic agenda constrains his foreign policy. Biden waited until Russia attacked Ukraine to impose his first round of economic sanctions.

After Germany announced it will finally increase its defense budget, Biden followed by stepping up new rounds of severe sanctions. However, he initially exempted Russia’s energy sector from sanctions, hoping energy imports from Russia would help check U.S. gas inflation caused by Biden’s anti-energy policies. Putin uses every dollar we pay for his oil and gas to finance his war on Ukraine as energy prices continue to rise.

Only after huge domestic pressure did Biden announce he will finally ban Russian oil imports. This means even more pain for Americans, as it will likely hike gas prices even further, and gas prices affect the price of just about everything Americans buy.

Yet as recently as his State of the Union speech Biden has made it clear that he remains committed to his “green energy” agenda that means strangling U.S. energy, causing high prices for Americans. Rather than rescinding his ruinous energy policies, the Biden administration is actively courting other authoritarian regimes from Saudi Arabia to Venezuela, hoping to increase their oil imports.

One Horrific Failure After Another

Even more incredibly, while sanctioning Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration reportedly has relied on Russia to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, which would shower another murderous regime with billions of dollars with no guarantee of any change of behaviors. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s chief negotiator, openly bragged that Iran has gotten more than it had expected.

The Biden administration has refused to share any details with the U.S. Congress and the American people. But we can be sure that any good deal for Iran’s mullahs will harm Americans’ safety, our national security, and peace in the Middle East.

Biden’s foreign policy blunders have weakened America’s international standing and sped up America’s decline. Biden’s flaws, especially his stubbornness and refusal to change course even when proven wrong, have become a significant obstacle to America’s prosperity and security.

As the saying goes, “Elections have consequences.” One of the biggest lessons learned from the Biden presidency is that foreign policy and domestic issues are often closely intertwined.

Biden’s presidency still has three long years to go and will encounter many more foreign policy challenges, including the biggest one: China’s likely invasion of Taiwan. If past history is an indicator of the future, thanks to too many Americans’ foolish votes for a known foreign policy bungler, China may end up replacing the United States as the dominant superpower in the new autocracy-friendly world order at the end of Biden’s first term.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/09/we-knew-before-he-took-office-that-joe-biden-would-set-foreign-policy-on-fire/,2022-03-09
"When It Comes To Oil, Biden Never Planned To Put America First","President Joe Biden stood up in front of the nation last Tuesday evening and claimed he wanted to prioritize buying products “made in America.”

“Folks, when we use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America, we’re going to do it by buying American. Buy American products. Support American jobs,” Biden told Congress last week.

The Democrat rambled to the nation about the importance of making sure “taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses” and even took a shot at the Trump administration in the process.

“Every administration — Democrat and Republican — says they’ll do it, but we’re actually doing it,” Biden boasted.

Biden can lie about prioritizing U.S. products all he wants, but if the last two weeks have taught us anything it’s that the current administration never actually planned to put America first.

One week after his whopper-riddled speech, Biden announced he would cut off oil imports from Russia as punishment for invading Ukraine. But instead of directing U.S. oil and gas companies to ramp up production, the Biden administration began to orchestrate deals with oil-rich Moscow allies and American enemies such as Iran, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia to compensate for the Russian crude imports, which doubled last year.

Already, the White House sent a delegation to Trump-sanctioned Venezuela to discuss pumping the nation’s state oil into the United States, and as President Nicolás Maduro said, “for the stability of the world.” Venezuela produces 500 percent more methane than U.S. producers, but Biden, who justified his war on U.S. oil by claiming he wanted to prioritize green energy, seems to have turned a blind eye to that fact and appears to be willing to strike a deal anyway. The White House also seems unbothered that just a couple of years ago, the United States tried to overthrow the Maduro regime but is now hoping it will sell Americans oil.

Biden is also considering a trip to Saudi Arabia to negotiate and possibly stimulate more oil production that could be exported globally. As Axios noted, “Biden has chastised Saudi Arabia, and the CIA believes its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was involved in the dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi” but now he seems willing to orchestrate a bargain.

While most of the West was quick to denounce Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine, countries such as Venezuela and Iran have both boosted their relationships and support for the disgraced nation in the last couple of weeks. Even over the last year, Russia, communist China, and Iran have all signaled their willingness to team up and exploit the Iran deal against the United States. The Biden administration previously sought Moscow’s assistance in reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow is still involved in those negotiations that could yield more foreign oil imports to the United States.

Under former President Donald Trump, the United States moved to ditch dealing with corrupt governments for oil and achieved energy independence. But when Biden assumed office, he sabotaged the U.S. oil and gas industry, hoping to replace it with his green energy policy agenda.

The president used his first year in office to choke domestic oil and gas production. He suspended oil and gas leases on public lands, nuked projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, canceled Arctic drilling leases, and rained down taxes and regulation on the energy industry.

As a result, domestic gas prices rose dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but Biden refuses to take responsibility. Shortly after he announced Russian oil would no longer be imported into the United States, the president denied cutting off domestic oil production to boost his green energy agenda.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That is simply not true,” Biden insisted.

PANTS ON FIRE: Biden says some high gas prices could be b/c of price-gouging & it's a lie to say he's stifled domestic energy.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also lied about the effects Biden’s poor energy policy has had on Americans, blaming the Russian-Ukraine conflict for rising gas prices. “The increase,” she said, “is a direct result of the invasion of Ukraine.” Psaki also claimed that “there was an anticipation” of rising prices.

Pres. Biden asked what can be done about skyrocketing gas prices: ""Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible."" pic.twitter.com/kqqjx0A6YV — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) March 8, 2022

The same Democrats and corporate media who decried Trump’s “America first” policy and smeared his “Made in America” campaign as a “hypocritical joke” tried to run interference to save Biden’s butt and spin his poor choices, but even their propaganda is falling short with voters.

If Biden cared about putting America and Americans first, he would encourage domestic oil production and lift his restrictions on the oil and gas industry. Instead, Biden and his administration are embracing the struggles caused by stifling American oil and gas production and risking his chances with Americans angry about rising gas prices to promote his green energy agenda.

“It should motivate us to accelerate a transition to clean energy. … Loosening environmental regulations … will not lower energy prices. … Transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy … will help,” Biden said.

After all, nothing will fulfill Biden’s goal to create a “100 percent clean-energy economy” like forcing Americans to buy $7 a gallon of foreign gas until they can’t afford it any longer.

Gas prices in West Hollywood, California are as high as $7.55.

Sending Fighter Jets To Ukraine Raises The Specter Of The Cold War,"The ongoing MiG-29 fiasco in Ukraine is a prime example of the incompetence of President Joe Biden’s administration. America was promised that electing Biden would put the “adults back in charge.” Instead, we’re led by a geriatric man surrounded by ideologues whose attitudes were formed in university safe-space bubbles and later solidified at Georgetown cocktail parties. (“Don’t like the price of gas? Get a Tesla or ride the bus, peasant.”)

Not to worry, though, Biden has dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Poland to solve the problem. The diplomatic and military affairs odyssey of trying to replenish the Ukrainian Air Force’s inventory of Soviet-era combat aircraft is illustrative of the descent of the American foreign policy establishment.

They’re said to be dragging their feet on the transfer of combat aircraft because Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened war should the transfer occur. This is highly unlikely — more so, given the less-than-impressive performance of the Russian military.

If Talleyrand said of the restored Bourbon dynasty after the abdication of Napoleon, “They had learned nothing and forgotten nothing,” then our foreign policy elite could be said to have “Learned nothing and forgotten everything.”

In 1950, as the Cold War was ramping up, the Soviet Union and People’s Republic of China gave permission for North Korea’s Kim Il-Sung (Kim Jong-un’s grandfather) to invade South Korea, which was then garrisoned by a small number of U.S. troops. The Soviets provided tanks, aircraft, infantry weapons, a large amount of ammunition, and other supplies to the North Korean military. The Soviets also sent combat pilots and anti-aircraft gunners to North Korea. These men killed Americans in combat.

But because an open admission of belligerent involvement would have serious ramifications for escalating tensions between the two nuclear powers (the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb in 1949), the Soviet assistance was covert. Soviet pilots were instructed not to speak Russian over their radios and their MiG-15s flew with the markings of the North Korean People’s Army Air Force or the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force, although American pilots often overheard the Soviet pilots speaking or swearing in Russian during the stress of aerial combat.

Some six Soviet pilots achieved “ace” status (downing five or more aircraft), with Soviets downing at least 142 U.N. (mostly U.S.) aircraft. A decade later, the Soviet Union provided significant support to North Vietnam in its Cold War proxy war with the South. In a speech in Moscow in 1971, senior North Vietnamese General Võ Nguyên Giáp admitted, “We would like to carry on this mission together with the Soviet Union, because no one can do it without the Soviet Union.”

About 3,000 Soviet military advisors were stationed in North Vietnam during the war. As in Korea, they killed Americans in direct combat. Some 16 of them were, in turn, killed, compared to the 58,281 Americans killed and more than 1.5 million Vietnamese lost on both sides.

Soviet involvement included the training of North Vietnamese fighter pilots and anti-aircraft crews starting in 1964, as well as the manning of anti-aircraft batteries in North Vietnam — successfully shooting down American combat aircraft. Ironically, these Soviet anti-aircraft personnel were mainly Ukrainian. Soviet commando teams also conducted missions against American targets and Soviet snipers may have even operated in South Vietnam.

As an aside, in 1993, after the fall of the Soviet Union, I helped stand up and manage a cargo aircraft refueling business in Kamchatka. The region’s vice governor at the time was Boris Sinchenko, an ethnic Ukrainian. Many of the people in Kamchatka and to the north in Magadan (the logistics hub of what Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn dubbed the “The Gulag Archipelago” ) were Ukrainian—exiled there as Stalin sought to extinguish the troublesome embers of Ukrainian national identity.

In a rare moment of vodka-assisted candor, Sinchenko (also rendered Zinchenko) told me he was an “air traffic controller” in Hanoi during the Vietnam War. Sinchenko’s euphemism in aid of polite conversation couldn’t hide what he was really doing in Hanoi—he was operating air defense radars that aimed to kill Americans.

Such was the Cold War. Both sides probed and tested each other’s will on the periphery, often resulting in deadly confrontations. But both sides tightly controlled the ramp to escalation, each wanting to avoid a general war that might involve nuclear weapons.

In today’s context, the issue of MiG-29s is no different from the provision of Javelin and other antitank and antiaircraft missiles to Ukraine, a sovereign nation. Further, these arms shipments — regardless of Putin’s threats — are significantly less provocative than the Soviets directly killing American servicemen in the theater of combat in Korea and Vietnam.

For U.S. and NATO assistance to Ukraine to rise to that level, we’d have to see American and allied fighter aircraft, piloted by Americans and operating from Ukrainian bases — but pretending to be Ukrainian — directly engaging Russian forces. To again draw from history, even that wouldn’t be considered a declaration of war by longstanding Cold War precedent.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/10/sending-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-raises-the-specter-of-the-cold-war/,2022-03-10
Western Leaders’ Forked Rhetoric Shows They Lie About ‘Liberal Values',"In one of history’s ironic twists of fate, western leaders met in Munich in late February for a conference that spectacularly failed to prevent a European war. Just as their predecessors in 1938, world leaders at the 2022 Munich Security Conference produced empty statements and self-aggrandizement.

History will judge the foreign policy and military failures of the West leading to the war in Ukraine. Yet it will likely overlook another factor in the crisis—these leaders have discarded all remnants of objectivity and moral credibility, a reality that has been painfully visible since the dual-shock of Brexit and the election of President Donald Trump in 2016.

Among the frequent rhetorical sleights of hand during this period, “rule of law” has been arguably the most important. Poland and Hungary frequently come under attack for these purported transgressions. Then-candidate Joe Biden included the countries with dictatorship Belarus in his ill-informed “thugs of the world” statement.

In Poland, political outrage has centered on a law to reform its courts, still heavily influenced by communist-era judges and their subsequent appointees. After his election, however, Biden unapologetically authorized a study to alter the U.S. Supreme Court to fit his party’s ideological preferences.

Hungary ratified a new constitution in 2011, a long-awaited development after two decades of a placeholder post-communist version. Despite its legally required two-thirds parliamentary approval, internal and external critics have called it undemocratic.

Yet the same rule-of-law scrutiny does not apply evenly across the western world, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently flaunted any semblance of democracy by arresting protesters and freezing the bank accounts of dissidents. Ideologically sympathetic pipeline protesters suffered no such fate in 2020.

As this was occurring, Trudeau gave a speech at the Munich conference. On February 23, the U.S. State Department touted the two “countries’ steadfast commitment to democratic values.” Clearly, to these world leaders, power grabs are legitimate if they are ideologically convenient.

In another naked power grab, the European Union has confronted member nations on sovereign issues like family, morality, and education of children, despite its constitutional lack of competence to do so. According to the bloc’s founding agreements, “every action taken by the EU is founded on treaties that have been approved voluntarily and democratically by all EU member countries…[I]f a policy area is not cited in a treaty, the Commission cannot propose a law in that area.”

Social issues like abortion, marriage, and sexual education in schools do not fall within the EU’s purview, a fact Brussels has regularly ignored. Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, head of the rotating presidency of the EU in the second half of 2021, cited “imaginary European values” as the reason for this habit.

Nevertheless, Catholic Poland and Catholic-Protestant Hungary have endured a particularly severe storm of Brusselian criticism over their defense of traditional social policies. In November 2019, after numerous Polish voivodeships and municipalities approved a “Charter of the Rights of the Family,” western media wasted little time before inventing the term “LGBT-free zones.”

Similarly, in June 2021, Hungary passed a law restricting sexual content aimed at school-age children. EU Commission leader Ursula von der Leyen quickly asserted, “This Hungarian bill is a shame.” Western media and Twitterati dubbed the law “anti-LGBT.” This month, Poland passed a similar law that would prevent sexual activists from conducting activities in Polish schools. An uproar from Brussels is inevitable.

Among the petty responses to these laws was an attempt by the Munich city council to project a rainbow pattern on the exterior of Munich’s Allianz Arena during a soccer match between Germany and Hungary in June. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte declared Hungary “has no place” in the EU anymore. Far more significantly, the European Commission launched proceedings against Poland and Hungary in what it termed “infringement procedures…related to the equality and the protection of human rights.”

While Brussels has spared little effort in combating such laws in its sovereign member states, it has remained generally quiet about threats to women and minorities on the ground. From Helsinki to Zürich, sexual assaults against women skyrocketed after the migrant crisis of 2015. In the most egregious example, more than 1,200 women were sexually assaulted or raped in Köln on New Year’s Eve 2015-16. Only 18 men were convicted.

On a continent once synonymous with female advancement, women are confronting warnings not to go out alone at night. The German government recorded a doubling of attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people from 2013 to 2018.

Many West European countries have recorded an increase in antisemitic acts with Muslim perpetrators in recent years, with varying degrees of government acknowledgment. According to American Jewish scholar Jonathan Tobin, “Jews are far safer [in] Eastern European countries such as Hungary and Poland — whose governments are controlled by right-wing populists — than they are in France and Germany.” Although EU policy shortcomings are at least partially responsible for these phenomena, Brussels bureaucrats are far more comfortable attacking political adversaries within the bloc.

This uneven judgment predictably stretched its tentacles to the novel realm of Covid-19 regulations. In spring 2020, for example, the requisite two-thirds of Hungarian parliamentarians approved a measure declaring a “state of danger,” an emergency provision that granted special powers to the government to address the pandemic; such a provision is allowed under the Hungarian constitution. In April of that year, the European parliament called the measure “totally incompatible with European values.”

France, ostensibly immune to such judgments, passed legislation via executive decree, suspended local elections, and implemented draconian measures—including forcible home confinement—on its citizens. Spain tracked its citizens’ outdoor movement with drones.

In 2021, Austria achieved perhaps a new low when it confined unvaccinated residents to their homes and barred them from entering restaurants, public facilities, and most shops. Vienna also enacted a law enforcing compulsory vaccination, the first such law in Europe. “European values,” unsurprisingly, seem to be more closely tied to political ideology than to individual liberties or pandemic responses.

Then, of course, is the topic of migration, one that has been unavoidable in both Europe and the United States for at least a decade. After Czechia, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia (and, later, Poland) rejected the EU’s migrant resettlement scheme, EU and German leaders suggested cutting funds to those countries. The European Court of Justice further ruled those countries must accept their compulsory number of migrants, a ruling they rejected. Just a half-decade later, the EU displayed less obstinacy on the same topic.

In November 2021, after Belarus ferried Middle Eastern migrants to the country’s borders with Poland and Lithuania, the EU changed its position on funding border walls. The bloc’s animosity toward the Belarusian authoritarian state ostensibly outweighed its desire to enforce its long-held open-borders doctrine.

Across the world—from authoritarian powers like China and Russia, to downtrodden western-looking states like Ukraine and Georgia, to lesser-among-equals Poland and Hungary—the pettiness and moral bankruptcy of the western elite is clearly recognizable in the foreign policy sphere. As long as this persists, it will have a profound impact on war and peace, defense and diplomacy.

Biden Will Absolutely Blame Putin For Everything Until The Midterms,"The White House repeatedly uses the Russia-Ukraine conflict to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the crises President Joe Biden created. Even when Americans point out the administration’s hypocrisy, the White House refuses to take responsibility for the domestic problems that it knows could result in the downfall of Democrats in the upcoming midterm election.

“Inflation goes up today, the president’s statement blames the ‘Putin Price Hike.’ Are you guys just going to start blaming Putin for everything until the midterms?” Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked during the White House press briefing on Thursday.

.@pdoocy Asks WH Press Secretary Jen Psaki About White House Messaging Of ""Putin Price Hikes""



""Inflation goes up today, the President's statement blames the 'Putin Price Hike.' Are you guys going to just start blaming Putin for everything until the midterms?"" pic.twitter.com/qgxyHoDiBB — The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle) March 10, 2022

Psaki, of course, refused to give Doocy a straight answer and instead told reporters that “we’ve seen the price of gas go up at least 75 cents since President Putin lined up troops on the border of Ukraine.”

Doocy countered by asking why the White House’s statement on January’s high inflation didn’t indict the Russian president then, especially if he was so guilty for causing the problems afflicting Americans since January of 2021, but Psaki didn’t bite.

Biden and his team at the White House will absolutely keep blaming Putin for all the domestic crises weighing on Americans because they have nothing to lose by refusing responsibility and everything to gain in the 2022 midterms.

Things in the U.S. are not going well for the Biden administration. The president’s approval rating may have slightly climbed after he made dozens of empty promises and lies at his State of the Union address but his first year in office was a complete disaster.

Under Biden’s watch, the U.S. Southern border was overwhelmed with illegal migration and increased drug trafficking, gasoline prices climbed astronomically, and the supply chain crisis hurt Americans already struggling under the weight of steadily increasing inflation.

Instead of taking responsibility for these problems and laying out solutions to fix them, the Biden administration has repeatedly deflected blame onto the pandemic and even corporate greed. One year into steadily rising and record-high energy costs, Psaki still had the guts this week to claim that high gas prices and expensive goods that have been plaguing Americans for months are Putin’s fault.

She also said they are “temporary and not long-lasting” even though the White House and the president himself previously insisted that price hikes were“expected” and would be “temporary.” Eight months after their predictions, inflation is at a 40 year high and is expected to climb higher in the coming months.

ABC's @MaryKBruce: ""Inflation numbers…showed consumers paying almost 8% more…& this was before Russia's invasion…How much higher does the [White House] expect prices to climb?""

As a result, Americans do not view the administration or Democrats favorably. Just recently, Biden and his leftist allies have tried to ditch their own detrimental Covid agenda in an attempt to win over frustrated voters. So far, their plan to satiate Americans, 40 percent of whom recently testified that they were “nervous” under the Biden presidency, is not working.

Americans largely vote with their pocketbooks. When gas costs $7 a gallon in parts of the country because Biden wants to broker deals with foreign enemies instead of reinstating American energy independence, voters who agree that economic conditions are their top priority are not happy. Recent polling suggests that more Americans, 51.6 percent, disapprove of the president and vice president than approve.

Biden and his team have epically failed in multiple ways. Despite the administration’s efforts to call U.S. attention to a foreign conflict, Americans affected by Biden’s incompetence won’t forget all of the domestic crises he’s created and then tried to ignore.

The White House has nothing to lose by blaming Putin and everything to gain by ignoring the crises Biden created. The more the administration spins the narrative, with the help of corrupt corporate media, to absolve themselves of blame, the better Democrats believe they will do in this year’s key election.

This Deep State Veteran's Answer On Alleged Biolabs In Ukraine Is Cause For Concern,"Does Ukraine have a bioweapons research program, and if it does, is the United States involved in it? In a characteristically insightful op-ed, Glen Greenwald noted that a colloquy last Monday at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee between Sen. Marco Rubio and Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland shed light on that question.

Both Russia and China have suggested that Ukraine has a bioweapons research program, and Rubio, apparently confident that Nuland would rebut those claims, asked her if they were true. To Rubio’s apparent surprise, Nuland replied, “uh, Ukraine has, uh, biological research facilities” and “we are now in fact quite concerned that Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to, uh, gain control of [those labs], so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.”

Rubio, who had begun the questioning by noting that he had only one minute of time left, chose not to pursue Nuland’s (apparently reluctant) admission. Rather than asking her to detail whether Ukraine’s “biological research facilities” were engaging in bioweaponry research (and whether the US was supporting that activity), Rubio used his remaining time to get Nuland to affirm that if a biological attack were to happen, Russia would be the guilty party. Obligingly, Nuland agreed that she was sure of that.

As Greenwald notes, this brief exchange raises a number of questions that our government needs to answer. Among them:

The question Rubio posed was whether Ukraine had “chemical or biological weapons.” Nuland’s answer referred to “biological research facilities.” Was that an indication that Ukraine did have biological weaponry, or the capability to develop it? Was Nuland really answering “Yes” to Rubio’s question? Rubio seemed surprised by Nuland’s answer. But he is the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. If the US is in fact assisting a Ukrainian bioweapons program, was the Senate Intelligence Committee not told of that? Why did Rubio cut Nuland off rather than following up and take the colloquy in a different direction? Why is the US urgently “working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces”? Is it perhaps because the materials would provide evidence of US involvement in a Ukrainian bioweaponry program? If the labs are working on Russian bioweapons, as the Pentagon claims, why has it taken so long to remove these biomaterials and why is Nuland worried that Russian bioweapons would fall into the hands of old Russians (who certainly would already have these bioweapons)? Rubio sought Nulan’s assurance that if there were an incident involving bioweapons, only Russia would be to blame for it. By asking that, Rubio heightened the risk of a “false flag” episode in which the Ukrainians used bioweaponry (assuming that there are such materials in the “facilities”), secure in the knowledge that the US would denounce the Russians for using it. Rubio seemed to be trying to close off any suggestion that Ukraine – and the US, if it is partnering with Ukraine in bioweaponry research – should be held accountable for any incident. How can the Republican chair of the intelligence committee be this irresponsible?

As Greenwald emphasizes, these are only questions, not claims of fact. We simply do not know, for sure, what is going on in Ukraine’s “biological research facilities.” The Ukrainian research program may well be designed solely for innocent and valid purposes such as animal health (e.g., combating swine fever virus) as Robert Pope, the Director of the Defense Department’s Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, has contended.

Mr. Pope affirms that the Russians may be seeking to gain control of the research facilities in order to fabricate evidence that would be used to substantiate their claims. Our urgency in preventing them from entering the facilities might be due to fear that that would happen. It would not be motivated by a desire to conceal or destroy evidence of Pentagon involvement in illegal bioweapons research.

The Pentagon’s Cooperative Defense Threat Program originated three decades ago as, essentially, an effort to undo the work of the large-scale Soviet bioweapons program, find alternative employment for the 65,000 scientists who had worked for it, clean up and monitor the sites where the illegal research had been done and promote research that would contribute to public health in the countries, including Russia, where the Soviet labs had been located. (Russia was initially favorable to the program.) According to Pope, the US has worked with 26 labs, some large, others small, in Ukraine and provides direct material support to six of them.

The evidence may bear out the Pentagon’s account. But the mere fact that Russia and China are unreliable sources and may well be spreading disinformation does not mean that suspicions about our own government or Ukraine’s are unfounded. Our government may be trying to prevent the Russians from obtaining evidence that would back up their charges – and seeking to preempt the effects of such disclosures by putting out our own “disinformation.”

More investigation by Congress, the media, foreign governments, and international organizations is required. We cannot presume that State and Defense Department officials involved with Ukraine and its biological research programs are disinterested witnesses telling the world the whole truth and nothing but the truth. There are solid reasons to doubt the veracity of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s accounts of the NIH’s role in funding research in Wuhan; why not that of other officials with skin in the game? Which brings us to the reliability of Rubio’s witness: Victoria Nuland.

Who is Victoria Nuland?

According to Salon magazine, Nuland, Biden’s Under Secretary of State, “is stuck in the quicksand of 1950s U.S.-Russia Cold War politics and dreams of continued NATO expansion, an arms race on steroids and further encirclement of Russia.” Nuland is married to the prominent neoconservative writer Robert Kagan, and was a foreign policy adviser to then-Vice President Dick Cheney from 2003-5, later migrating to Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy staff.

She has risen in the State Department since then and even played a role in the Russiagate conspiracy. Her activities included pushing Fusion GPS conspiracy theories in the State Department, and then disseminating these conspiracy theories into the broader Obama administration — all while she was planning on serving a Hillary Clinton administration if Trump lost.

If you are searching for an Avatar of the Deep State, dial Nuland.

Let’s go back to Ukraine’s “Maidan Revolution” of February 2014 — a US-backed coup or revolution that brought down the legitimate, elected (but also corrupt, dishonest, and “pro-Russian”) Yanukovych government of Ukraine.

The events marked a critical turning point in US-Russian relations. It sealed the end of President Obama’s fumbling attempt at a Russian “reset.” It helped confirm Vladimir Putin’s belief that US “democracy promotion” was a guise for extending the US sphere of influence and encircling Russia with hostile neighbors. And some of the key players in those events eight years ago — Victoria Nuland, Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden — are running US policy on Ukraine today.

Architect of the Second Cold War

When Nuland was an Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, piloting US policy in Ukraine in 2013 and 2014, she revealed that the US had “invested” over $5 billion in democracy promotion in Ukraine since 1991. She also took it for granted that Ukraine had a “European future” – from which, apparently, Russia would be excluded.

Then in February 2014, as the Yanukovych government began to crumble in the face of popular demonstrations, Nuland had a telephone conversation with the US Ambassador in Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt. The conversation was intercepted (presumably, by Russian intelligence) and released. (The US has not denied its authenticity). The transcript is available online.

Together, Nuland and Pyatt began to handpick the personnel to lead the post-Yanukovich government. According to Richard Sakwa, a leading British scholar of Russian and Ukrainian affairs, “[a]lthough the mantra of the Atlantic powers was that Ukrainian sovereignty should be respected, the tape revealed that the US had clear ideas on who should assume power… [I]t reveals a high degree of US meddling in Ukrainian affairs.” Nuland rejected one opposition leader, Vitaly Klitschko and nominated another, Arsenty Yatsenyuk (who indeed was anointed as the next Prime Minister).

Then Nuland and Pyatt discussed how to bring this result about. Nuland wanted to bring in the UN, to put an international seal of approval on the deal, and expressed – using the traditionally nuanced language of diplomacy – her dissatisfaction with our European allies’ efforts: “I think, to help glue this thing and to have the UN help glue it and, you know, fuck the EU.”

Nuland also informed Pyatt that the US would wheel in then-Vice President Joe Biden at the appropriate time to bless the regime change. The BBC’s lightly edited version of the transcript reads:

When I wrote the note [US vice-president’s national security adviser Jake] Sullivan’s come back to me VFR [direct to me], saying you need [US Vice-President Joe] Biden and I said probably tomorrow for an atta-boy and to get the deets [details] to stick. So Biden’s willing.

Reflecting on this episode in his magistral 2018 book “Republic in Peril“, the international relations scholar David Hendrickson writes:

The renewal of the cold war with Russia in Europe was the most lamentable, and perhaps even most inexplicable, blunder of the Obama presidency. Victoria Nuland marched into Kiev with as much élan as any neoconservative could muster, successfully encouraging the February revolution, but the grim and predictable result was a stark deterioration of U.S.-Russian relations and the breakdown of the post-Cold War peace.

What is to be Done?

Nuland and many D.C. politicians including Rubio are not in search of the truth here, rather they have an agenda of military confrontation with Russia. This agenda is both wildly irresponsible, and completely ignores the overwhelming will of the American people to stay out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Because of the lack of honestly from the D.C. political class, honest politicians and media professionals need to be dogged in their search for answers. Recall that China, as well as Russia, has accused the US of promoting bioweaponry research – and not only in Ukraine. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, “The US has 336 labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in Ukraine alone. It should give a full account of its biological military activities at home and abroad and subject itself to multilateral verification.” And Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has argued that “the United States, as the party that knows the laboratories best, should release relevant specific information as soon as possible, including what viruses are stored and the research that has been carried out.”

That seems like a perfectly reasonable request: if the US and Ukraine truly have nothing to hide, why not disclose what viruses have been stored and what research has been carried out in Ukraine? And why not submit to independent, international verification of the kind we demanded when Iraq was suspected of creating weapons of mass destruction?

Moreover, why shouldn’t the US welcome Russia and China to submit their alleged evidence to international scrutiny? Russia has called for a special meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the purported US bioweapons program. If this is merely Russian propaganda distracting from Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, America should have the means to thoroughly demonstrate this fact before the world. It could call for a special Security Council meeting itself.

And meanwhile, let the global community, including the US, call on Russia not to take control of – still less, to damage – Ukraine’s biological research facilities. Let the facilities be isolated, as far as possible, from both parties to the ongoing conflict and from us, and let them be cordoned off (like a crime scene) by some kind of international police force.

If Russia and China are lying, the world needs to know. If the US is lying, the world needs to know that too.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/11/deep-state-veteran-victoria-nulands-answer-on-alleged-bioweapon-labs-in-ukraine-is-cause-for-concern/,2022-03-11
"In Ukraine, Escalation Risks Pulling NATO Into The War","There’s a growing chorus of voices, mostly in Washington and among the corporate press, arguing the United States and our North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies need to do more to assist Ukraine against Russia. Providing the Ukrainians Javelin antitank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, as well as small arms and munitions, we’re told, isn’t enough. Nor are the unprecedented and devastating economic sanctions we’ve leveled against Russia, which arguably amount to a declaration of war.

They say we need to send warplanes, tanks, and advanced weapons systems. Some particularly enthusiastic neocons are even arguing that NATO should impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, directly engaging Russian fighter jets and targets on the ground in a tactical air campaign against the Russians. But, at the very least, NATO allies should send Ukraine some MiG-29 fighter jets, and maybe even U.S. Patriot missile-defense systems.

These arguments tend to gloss over whether the United States and our allies can safely do any of this without embroiling NATO in a war with Russia. Even setting aside the question of a no-fly zone, which the Biden administration has for now ruled out, we are nevertheless trying to get as close to the line of belligerence without crossing over it. It very likely won’t be possible. On our current course, whether our leaders realize it or not, we’re mindlessly marching toward war with Russia.

Proponents of escalation wave this possibility away with appeals to history. Our experience over the past 70 years, they say, shows that Moscow will back down in the face of aggressive measures by the West. Look at the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Look at the U.S. strategic airlift operation to Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, even as the Soviet Union was resupplying Egypt and Syria. Much more recently, look at the 2018 Battle of Khasham, in which hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed when they attacked U.S. special forces in Syria.

These historical examples are often paired with others that purport to show a pattern of Russian and American tolerance for the arming and training of one another’s battlefield enemies. The Russians have tolerated the West arming their enemies before, so why should this be any different?

Consider Washington’s intensive support of the Afghan mujahedeen during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. On the Russian side, consider the Soviet advisors stationed in North Vietnam during the war, training and in some cases actively fighting alongside the enemy.

My friend Chuck DeVore cited this example in these pages recently, noting that some 3,000 Soviet advisors were stationed in Vietnam during the war, and that starting in 1964 they were training North Vietnamese fighter pilots and anti-aircraft crews, as well as actively manning anti-aircraft batteries themselves and shooting down American pilots.

Other historical examples along these lines abound, and together they form a rough, two-pronged thesis: Russia will back down when challenged by American power, and Russia will tolerate the arming of its battlefield enemies by the West so long as American soldiers are not the ones pulling the trigger or flying the warplanes. In all of these cases, war never erupted between the Soviet Union and the United States, so why should Ukraine be any different?

To this, one might reply that Ukraine represents a fundamentally different kind of conflict than those cited above. This is not Cuba in 1962, Israel in 1973, or Afghanistan in the 1980s. It is not Vietnam or Syria. All those conflicts, at least on the Russian side, were peripheral. (Cuba was not peripheral for the United States, but its usefulness as an historical precedent in the Ukraine war is rather limited.)

For Russia, the fate of Ukraine is a matter of national security. Its status is of paramount strategic importance for Moscow. One need not agree that it should be to acknowledge that as far as the Kremlin is concerned, it is.

So as the war in Ukraine drags on, and Russian and Ukrainian losses mount, we should not assume that Moscow will react as it has to more peripheral conflicts in the past. We should not take it for granted that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who seems to have staked his regime on the successful invasion and subjugation of Ukraine, will simply cut his losses and neatly withdraw the way Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989.

Awareness of all this should also inform policymaking in Washington about whether to encourage and materially support a prolonged Ukrainian insurgency if Russian forces destroy Ukraine’s military, as they likely will. Is the Biden administration willing to risk war with Russia on the assumption that Moscow will be as tolerant of American sponsorship of Ukrainian guerillas as it was of anti-Soviet Afghan guerillas?

So too, on the question of economic sanctions. Is it the policy of the United States and our NATO allies that Russia’s economy should be destroyed utterly and its people plunged into generations-long poverty over the invasion of Ukraine? Do they think a policy of prolonged economic warfare can be maintained without Putin at some point deciding that it constitutes an act of war? Are we making plans and preparations in the event he does?

More immediately, are we exploring off-ramps with Ukraine and Russia? Does the Biden administration have in mind post-war scenarios or negotiated settlements that it would not only accept but actively broker?

Or is the only vision of the war’s end the maximalist one that Secretary of State Anthony Blinken articulated earlier this month, in which a humiliated and defeated Russia withdraws completely from a totally independent and territorially intact Ukraine? If that’s the case, then it seems almost certain the war is going to widen beyond Ukraine, and perhaps, to avoid the end-state that Blinken describes, involve the use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

None of this is to advocate for the kind of isolationism propounded by some on the so-called New Right. Nor is it to foreswear any and all foreign intervention in the name of our national interest. But it is simply to recognize that this particular war is not easily explained by examples from the Cold War, when everything turned out alright, or by appeals to past events and conflicts on Russia’s periphery.

Rather, it is to acknowledge bluntly that if the West is not willing to back a negotiated compromise in Ukraine, then our continued military assistance to the Ukrainians, as well as our sanctions regime against Moscow, risks setting in motion a chain of events that we won’t be able to control and that could easily lead us into a war with Russia.

The West’s Real Ukraine Strategy Is Russian Regime Change,"“Threaten our homeland, our way of life, and most importantly our leader, and yes, we will nuke the sh-t of out you. I guarantee it.” That’s what a senior retired Russian diplomat told me on the sidelines of a Track 2.0 dialogue in 2012 when I asked him what would happen during a NATO-Russian war or a threat to the Russian government itself.

He was pretty clear: Threats Russia’s sovereignty, ability to control its territory, run its economy—and most of all, ensure leadership survival—were all things it might go to nuclear war over. Isn’t that what we are doing today regarding the Ukraine crisis?

While surely we should do all we can to help Ukraine in its time of need, we should also ask how far are we willing to go in that effort. To be clear, we are putting a historic amount of pressure on Russia, more than some countries endure in a real, kinetic war. In the months to come, that pressure will have a combined impact, and we have not stopped at all to consider the ramifications.

In fact, we have chosen by accident a new de facto Ukraine strategy. It’s so terrifying and stupid that it’s never been tried before on a nuclear-armed superpower capable of ending nearly all human life in 30 minutes.

The West’s undeclared goal is simple: Putin has to go. Or, Putin has to die, as some on right are now cheerleading.

Yes, that means regime change, wrapped in all of its fantastical failures, is making a comeback in Washington, and no one seems to notice or even care. No one also seems to understand that’s our new goal now, what that means, and the ramifications for our world—like a full-blown nuclear war if we push Putin too far into the geopolitical gutter.

Now, one would think the idea of trying to depose the leader of the largest nation on earth, with the third most powerful military and 140 million citizens, would be at least debated in full view. But clearly, in our rush for a moral victory, we have seemingly chosen the most damaging of actions against Russia time and time again.

We haven’t even stopped to grasp what sort of future awaits us mere months down the road. That’s because we don’t even know what we are doing, as feel-good hashtags on social media, trending topics, and activism-based policy lead us down a dark path.

How Many Arms Are We Sending to Ukraine?

Take, for example, our arms shipments to Ukraine, which, to be clear, is needed and is the right decision, are of a scale we haven’t even begun to grasp. The West has committed to sending 17,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, even though Russia has just 12,000 tanks in its entire military arsenal, a fraction of which are in Ukraine fighting.

Then there are the anti-air missiles. Again, while surely needed, the numbers are astounding, as the West has committed to at least several thousand shoulder-fired missiles, including the vaunted Stinger missile that gave the old Soviet Union such headaches in Afghanistan. We will indeed send more anti-air missiles than Russian fighter jets, bombers, and drones that Russia can place in the skies.

Western leaders are even now trying to secure older air defense systems of Soviet vintage to tighten up Ukraine’s air defense and shoot down more Russian planes—many of which could come from North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations, something that will surely enrage Moscow.

Then there are those Polish MiG-29s every so-called expert calls the Biden administration stupid for not wanting to send to Ukraine. The simple reality is that such fighters could be seen by Russia as NATO directly intervening in the conflict, especially if those MiGs decided to attack targets in Russia itself, which is highly possible at this point.

But of course—and maybe the only saving grace in this insane idea—the jets likely will never head to Ukraine in the first place, as they have been upgraded so dramatically they are not nearly the same as what Ukraine uses now. You can’t train for combat operations in what amounts to a new jet in a time of war against an enemy that has advanced air defenses. It could take weeks, maybe even months, to get pilots trained, ground crews trained, and make sure the systems on the plane aren’t in Polish but Ukrainian.

Western foreign policy elites surely have bigger dreams, and that of course is a no-fly zone or the newly repackaged idea of a limited no-fly zone, which is basically the same thing. Yet they won’t ever admit that to implement anything like this you would need to destroy any Russian air defenses that would threaten our pilots, some of which means attacking targets in Russia. That means war with Russia.

On top of all of this, the Biden administration will likely send another $6.5 billion in arms to assist Ukraine. Some are now even calling for Team Biden to send used F-15s and A-10 Warthogs to help Ukraine, turning out aid from something that is purely defensive to taking an offensive tone in nature, with no ability to control escalation, as is the case even with thousands of defensive missiles.

We Have Unleashed an Economic War on Russia

While gas prices here at home are already at record highs and could climb still further thanks to Biden’s banning of Russian energy, Putin is facing what is easily the most damaging package of sanctions any nation has ever faced in human history. Such sanctions, in their totality, aren’t designed to get Vlad to pull out of Ukraine but to slaughter Russia’s economy. Indeed, when combined with the amount of bleeding we want his forces to endure on the battlefield, declared or not, it’s clear Western elites want Putin’s regime to go down in flames.

The facts don’t lie. In just a few weeks’ time, we have kicked most Russian banks out of the SWIFT payment verification system, meaning trying to send and receive money from Russian banks has now effectively ended, a possible death sentence to Russia’s banking system.

Russia also has lost the ability to use its more than $600 billion in foreign exchange reserves to stop the death of its currency. Those two actions alone guarantee Moscow’s economy is now certain to not only go into a historic economic depression but lose as much as 35 percent of its current value, with Russia now even unable to even take out debt to try and save itself. Even Visa and Mastercard won’t operate in Russia anymore.

Then there are the more stealthy private economic sanctions that don’t get as much attention but could, over the long term, be even more damaging. Almost every major Western recognized brand is pulling out of any meaningful business operation in Russia or taking the dramatic step of divesting its assets there altogether, taking huge losses in the process.

Tech and computer chip companies won’t do business with Russia now. Banks are leaving in droves. Even oil colossus BP will take a $25 billion loss and exit its oil partnerships in Russia. With oil being Russia’s most precious and sellable asset, such actions should only be seen for what they are: something far beyond the size and scale to get Russia to back off in Ukraine.

This Means Regime Change Is the Policy

The sad thing is, even though we haven’t come to admit to what the world de facto collectively wants, we aren’t able to connect the policy dots and see the threat we have made against a nation with more than 5,000 nuclear weapons. Putin certainly gets it. And he is trying to remind us of that fact.

Just a few weeks ago, Putin put his forces on a strange “nuclear alert” that seemed to shock even his most senior military officials in the room, seemingly not knowing that was coming. His rationale was simple: he understood that the West, in all of its high-minded moral outrage, has placed so much pressure on his regime that they will only accept one outcome now.

He sees the number of weapons being placed in Ukraine, the financial nuclear war that has been unleashed on his country, and the calls to send fighter jets and set up no-fly zones as all targets on his back. His nuclear alert was to remind the world he will use those weapons if his rule is questioned.

Accepting An Unjust Ending in an Unjust World

Sadly, history tells us how the war in Ukraine will end if we are lucky. Ukraine will be destroyed. Russia will take parts of its territory. Kyiv will join the European Union and NATO but not officially, integrating itself economically and getting billions in weapons to deter another Russian invasion. Russia will be massively weakened and completely dependent on China for its economic survival, selling anything it can to Beijing, including its best weapons, to survive.

What if we aren’t lucky, and the war drags on for months? Putin will keep upping the pressure, and we will do the same. With every bomb Russia drops on Ukraine, the moral outrage will keep rising and Western nations will give Ukraine more and more arms and sanction Russia in every way possible to the point that Russia will come close to collapse.

At some point, when Putin sees the Ukraine crisis as not a giant mistake but instead a fight for his own survival, true hell will break loose.

"If It's 'Propaganda' That Zelensky Provoked Putin, NYT Is Guilty Of Spreading It","Tucker Carlson spouted more pro-Putin propaganda on his Fox News show this week, arguing that the “collision” between Ukraine and Russia was long coming and that it was provoked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with tacit approval from President Joe Biden.

Wait, I got that wrong. It wasn’t this week, and it wasn’t Tucker Carlson. It was The New York Times. My mistake!

The paper’s Moscow bureau chief, Anton Troianovski, made that exact case in an episode of the Times’ “The Daily” podcast on March 8. It’s apparently pro-Putin to say anything other than “I stand with Ukraine and Zelensky is hot,” but it’s worth recounting what Troianovski said: that Russia was initially hopeful of a cooperative relationship with Zelensky, but after Biden was elected, the Ukrainian president felt encouraged to take a more antagonistic position on Putin.

Troianovski said it was Ukraine’s rejection of a Covid vaccine developed by Russia in 2020 that first indicated Zelensky was “taking a pro-Western route and being skeptical, being cautious of getting too close to Russia.” And thereafter, Zelensky “became more outspoken” about Ukraine joining NATO, a notion that has always been treated by Russia as a security threat.

Troianovski said that then the transition from President Donald Trump, who was, at best, ambivalent toward Ukraine, to Biden, who had a heightened interest, created more tension. Biden, Troianovski said, “comes in, of course, with a message of much greater support for Ukraine to take a path that brings it closer to Western institutions and takes it farther away from Russia.”

For Zelensky, Biden’s inauguration was a green light, the reporter said. And just so there’s no mistake that these are the words of a high-level New York Times correspondent and not some Russia State television message I’m relaying on my own, here’s what Troianovski said in full:

“So what happens is just days after Biden is inaugurated, Zelensky cracks down on a business tycoon in Ukraine named Viktor Medvedchuk. And that’s important because Medvedchuk is basically the closest link remaining between Ukraine and the Kremlin. Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter. Medvedchuk runs a political party that is fairly pro-Russian. He was running several TV channels that were pro-Russian, and early last year, Zelensky closes those TV channels, starts an investigation into Medvedchuk. Last May, Medvedchuk was put under house arrest under suspicion of treason. So Zelensky took all these steps that were very aggressive, and that was something that clearly annoyed Putin greatly and in retrospect was likely one of the factors that exacerbated the situation between Ukraine and Russia.”

When Zelensky closed down those TV channels just after Biden’s inauguration, he added insult to injury by tweeting at the time, “Ukraine strongly supports freedom of speech. Not propaganda financed by the aggressor country that undermines Ukraine on its way to the [European Union] and EuroAtlantic integration.”

Troianovski’s colleague Michael Barbaro summarized. “So Anton, you’re saying the shift in the U.S. presidency from Trump to Biden represented to Zelensky that he had more Western support,” Barbaro said, “and that basically he had some backup if he wanted to cross Putin and so it’s then that he starts taking more and more aggressive steps to move away from Russia.”

“Exactly,” Troianovski replied, “and as [Zelensky’s] presidency progressed, he found himself more and more on a collision course with Vladimir Putin.”

Blowing air in the face of a dog doesn’t mean you deserve to get your nose bitten off, but it’s a possibility easily avoided by keeping your mouth shut. Likewise, to acknowledge reality isn’t to say Russia is justified in declaring war on Ukraine. But maybe it was a mistake for Zelensky, under the impression that Biden’s America was eager to fight Ukraine’s battles, to flex on Putin.

These Reckless Elites Wish War On The West With Calls For No-Fly Zone,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has begged President Joe Biden and NATO for a no-fly zone for weeks — and for weeks now, American neocons, hotheads, Russia hoaxers, sitting congressmen, and corporate media figures eager for escalation with Moscow are calling for it too.

A no-fly zone in Ukraine means NATO would prohibit Russian warplanes from flying through Ukrainian airspace. To do that, NATO fighter jets would engage and shoot down any Russian aircraft they encountered.

As noted by multiple lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle, as well as other experts, a no-fly zone in Ukraine would be an act of war against Russia. It would quickly usher in a conflict between multiple countries with access to nuclear weapons. A no-fly zone wouldn’t just mean NATO warplanes shooting down Russian aircraft, it would also throw the door open for Russian warplanes to shoot down American aircraft and take American lives in retaliation.

“It means starting World War III,” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said. “People need to understand what a no-fly zone means. It’s not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by. It’s the willingness to shoot down the aircraft of the Russian Federation.”

Despite the clear consequences of imposing a no-fly zone, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who was censured by the Republican National Committee for buying into the Democrats’ lies about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and targeting political opponents, is just one of the many proponents of this dangerous idea.

2) History teaches that taking a stand is inevitable and gets more costly with time. We own the skies, Russia cannot hold a candle to our Air power. Do this. Putin is too dangerous to hope he is satisfied with “just Ukraine.” — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) February 25, 2022

To Kinzinger, who has nothing to lose because he isn’t running for reelection, a no-fly zone is an opportunity for political grandstanding.

This is a good moment to renew my call for a no fly zone, at the invitation of the Ukraine government. I fear if this continues, we will have to intervene in a bigger way — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) March 4, 2022

Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, a likely candidate to become the next ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was also quick to call for “a strong coalition of like-minded nations” to “step in and seriously consider” a no-fly zone.

Some congressmen have yet to fully embrace such a rash strategy but have signaled a willingness to move toward an air campaign against Russia if the Ukraine conflict worsens.

“To take anything off the table, thinking we might not be able to use things because we’ve already taken it off the table, is wrong,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said when asked by NBC’s Chuck Todd if he would support a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently called for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he would endorse a no-fly zone if Putin turned to chemical weapons to fuel his invasion of Ukraine.

The Washington Post also amplified calls for a no-fly zone. Politico jumped on board by publishing an open letter by 27 foreign policy experts who claimed that the United States and NATO should enact a “limited” no-fly zone in order to provide humanitarian aid.

“What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation

with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive

loss of Ukrainian lives,” the letter states.

In addition to the propaganda press calling for a no-fly zone, some supporters have turned to psychological operations such as lullabies and manipulated videos to emphasize their desire for taking out Russian warplanes.

If you don't close the sky I will die.

Whether they believe it or not, these bureaucrats and talking heads claim that the only way to end the conflict is to choose the option that will escalate confrontation with Russia and might well lead to U.S. boots on the ground in a full-scale war.

Seventy-eight prominent professors, experts, and other foreign affairs pundits said as much in an open letter last week, which they penned in an effort to communicate just how volatile a no-fly zone would be.

“We deplore Russia’s aggression, admire the bravery of Ukrainians, mourn the loss of innocent life, and wish for a speedy end to the conflict. However, it strains credulity to think that a US war with Russia would make the American people safer or more prosperous,” the letter states. “To the contrary, going to war with Russia, a nuclear peer of the United States, would expose Americans to vast and unnecessary risks. A war that expands beyond Ukraine’s borders could also inflict damage across Europe and weaken America’s Nato allies. We call upon the administration to avoid such a gambit and continue to use appropriate diplomatic means and economic pressure to end the conflict.”

The type of escalation required by a no-fly zone in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is not only unnecessary, but it’s also unpopular with the American people. While propaganda press pollsters drum up support for a no-fly zone, which they promote as the best way to “protect Ukraine from Russian air strikes,” most Americans still do not want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.

In that, Americans have demonstrated better sense than our talking heads and neocon politicians, who are willing to go to war with Russia under the guise of imposing a no-fly zone.

The Ukraine Crisis Is A Wake-up Call For Taiwan And Japan,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has raised the concern that China’s leader Xi Jinping may be emboldened to invade Taiwan soon. Such fear has shifted attitudes and strategic thinking in Taiwan and its ally Japan.

The last time Taiwan faced military assault by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was in 1958. On August 23, under Chairman Mao Zedong’s directive, the PLA heavily bombed Quemoy, Matsu, and other surrounding offshore islands. The PLA’s bombardment of Taiwan only stopped after the United States demonstrated its will to defend Taiwan by sending six aircraft carriers, three heavy cruisers, 40 destroyers, and two air force divisions to Taiwan strait.

Since then, the Taiwanese people have enjoyed several decades of peace and prosperity. The Chinese Communist Party changed tactics and had hoped that deepening economic ties between Taiwan and mainland China would eventually “reunite” Taiwan with the motherland peacefully. To the CCP’s disappointment, a poll shows that most Taiwanese don’t identify as Chinese.

China’s Xi Jinping vowed never to rule out taking Taiwan by force. The PLA has increased both the frequency and the number of fighter jets it sent near Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), hoping to intimidate the Taiwanese people. Still, most Taiwanese didn’t take Beijing’s military threat seriously until Russia invaded Ukraine.

Taiwan’s People Prepare

The Taiwanese people are shaken by the brutality of modern warfare and the increased possibility that they could experience similar attacks by China. They have seen that the United States and its western allies didn’t send any troops to Ukraine. Instead, they have only imposed economic sanctions against Russia and provided economic and military aid to Ukraine.

The Taiwanese couldn’t help but realize that they could count on no one but themselves to defend their island if China invades. They have also found inspiration from Ukrainians’ ferocious resistance. Interest among ordinary Taiwanese in taking first-aid or self-defense training has jumped since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Taiwanese government officials and national security experts are reassessing the island’s defense strategy based on the tactics and weaponry Ukrainians deployed to hold off Russia’s advance. Some noted that “Russia’s difficulties getting paratroopers in shows how important functioning air defenses are… and how useful small, mobile systems such as Stinger man-portable missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles are in that situation,” according to the Financial Times. From Ukraine’s resistance, Taiwan’s defense officials learned that “lightweight and indigenously-developed Kestrel shoulder-launched anti-armor rocket” are some must-have weapons for urban warfare.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen favors the idea of “asymmetric warfare,” the same strategy the Ukrainian military deployed “to make its forces more mobile and hard to attack with, for example, vehicle-mounted missiles,” Reuters reports.

There is a debate about revising the island’s military conscription program, established in 1951. Since 2013, the conscription period has been reduced from two years to four months. Many defense experts have complained that the current conscription period is too short and the training inadequate.

In the past, since any discussion of extending the conscription period polled poorly, the Taiwanese government hesitated to debate the issue publicly. But now, the Ukraine crisis has shifted public opinion. More and more Taiwanese are willing to at least debate extending the conscription period to be better prepared to defend their homeland.

Japan Reacts to Ukraine

The Ukraine crisis has had surprising effects on Japan too. Since World War II, Japan has vowed to be a pacifist nation. Its post-war constitution forbids the country from raising its military and limits its defense spending to 1 percent of GDP. There is also a solid anti-military sentiment in large parts of Japanese society that makes any discussion of increasing defense spending unpopular.

But in recent years, the Japanese people have become uneasy with China’s increasing aggression in Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and the disputed Senkaku Islands. Japan has been vocal about China’s military threat to Taiwan. Given the geographical proximity of Taiwan and Japan, Japan regards a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as a direct threat to Japan’s security.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned that “A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency.” After Russia invaded Ukraine, Abe called on the Biden administration to abandon the U.S. government’s long-held “strategic ambiguity” position on Taiwan, which doesn’t commit the United States to Taiwan’s defense.

Japan Considers Increased Defense

Japan also found an unexpected source of inspiration: Germany. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany surprised the world by announcing that it would double its defense spending to 2 percent of GDP, a target set by NATO that Germany had resisted for decades.

Germany’s sudden change of heart ignited a debate in Japan about whether Tokyo should follow suit to increase its defense spending to 2 percent of GDP. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida recently said, “In light of the recent invasion of Ukraine, a new National Security Strategy (NSS) will be formulated, and we must firmly discuss what exactly is required to protect the lives and livelihoods of the Japanese people.”

Besides calling for increasing defense spending, former prime minister Abe also kicked off a debate on housing American nuclear weapons on Japanese soil under NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangement. Former U.S. President Trump had brought up this idea.

As the only country attacked by atomic weapons in the past, hosting nuclear weapons had been a non-starter in Japan. But the Ukraine crisis has compelled Japan to look for ways to shore up its defense against China.

For now, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is focused on increasing the defense budget while rejecting Abe’s call for nuke-sharing with the United States. Kishida may have to reconsider soon, since China announced that it would increase defense spending by 7.1 percent to $229 billion in 2022. Most China observers believe China’s actual defense spending is much higher than this official figure.

In addition, U.S. intelligence agencies released a report this week saying China “will continue the largest-ever nuclear force expansion and arsenal diversification in its history,” and it isn’t “interested in agreements that restrict its plans,” according to U.S. intelligence.

It is difficult for Japan to remain pacifist as Beijing enhances its military capacity to advance its geopolitical dominance in Asia and beyond. At the same time, from Afghanistan to Ukraine, the Biden administration has shown it is incompetent and unreliable during a crisis.

The Ukraine crisis has brought unconscionable suffering to the Ukrainian people, and it revealed some of the harm authoritarian regimes can cause. If there is one positive outcome of this crisis, Taiwan and Japan have begun to take China’s military threat seriously. The steps they are taking to strengthen their defense may keep the peace in the region by deterring China from launching military strikes against Taiwan.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/15/the-ukraine-crisis-is-a-wake-up-call-for-taiwan-and-japan/,2022-03-15
"While Vilifying Putin, The EU Punishes Democracy In Hungary And Poland","Last week, the European Union voted to withhold funding from member states Poland and Hungary for being out of step with “European Union values.”

According to one writer who supported the vote, these two countries’ “governments railed against what they saw as the EU’s promotion of social liberalism and gay rights and both have shown disdain for institutional constraints of liberal democracy such as independent courts and media freedom.” Because of this, Poland and Hungary have been portrayed as more aligned with Vladimir Putin’s Russia than Angela Merkel’s EU.

At the moment, Poland and Hungary are taking on the vast majority of refugees from Ukraine, so far 1.5 million and 215,000, respectively. Like the rest of the EU, both countries are also beholden to Russia for their energy. For this reason, it’s easy to imagine that both countries’ governments mainly wish to give the Russians what they want and end the invasion instead of supporting Ukraine’s resistance.

For all the talk of unifying the EU and reining in autocrats, this vote proved the opposite. EU leadership in Brussels saw an opportunity to cut down dissent, and they took it.

They exploited the anti-Russian fervor that came out of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to associate member states with the unpopular Putin regime as well as the great burden of refugees both countries are enduring. This gave them a plausible pretext to suppress these countries’ sovereignty, withhold much-needed funds, and diminish the power of socially conservative presidents Victor Orban and Andrzej Kaczyński.

This whole event is a perfect illustration of what the EU has become, which is probably why most corporate news outlets have not reported on it. It is an oppressive system run by unaccountable bureaucrats and officials who use economic and political pressure to overturn democratically elected governments that fail to follow the party line. This has less to do with protecting LGBT people and freedom of the press, and more to do with destroying populist conservatives critical of the EU.

To understand this system, it’s important to recognize that Western Europe has long since moved on from democratic liberalism towards a transnational oligarchy that uses identity politics and leftist ideology to consolidate power and eliminate freedoms. In these countries, an unaccountable elite controls unaccountable institutions (like the EU parliament) to squeeze ever more compliance from their populations. It was precisely this problem that led men like my father to leave France and seek a life here in the United States.

As David Harsanyi documents in his recent book “Eurotrash,” this system has left Western Europe poorer, weaker, less relevant, and much less free. Western European leaders routinely curtail free speech with catch-all hate speech laws and impose greater dependency among populations with confiscatory taxes and government monopolies. Rather than producing happier, safer, more harmonious countries, they have segregated, unproductive countries reliant on the U.S. military to protect them from invasion.

Nevertheless, in much the same way Justin Trudeau had to hypocritically vilify Canadian truckers as white supremacists threatening democracy, EU representatives will hypocritically vilify Hungary and Poland as autocracies threatening Western Europe’s liberal values. It is shameless projection, hiding an increasingly obvious fact that the classical liberal tradition is on the wane in much of the West.

Whether it’s because of Covid, the environment, sympathies with Russia, or protecting minorities, Western governments have been all too willing to take away their peoples’ rights. Either they do this directly by simply banning speech and rigging elections, or they do it indirectly by withholding funds, freezing assets, and restricting economic activity. All recourses for changing leadership are thereby removed, and people are forced to consume unchallenged propaganda and hope that the oligarchs are kind to them.

This is what’s at work in Poland and Hungary. Somehow, they are the ones to be sanctioned while an embattled Ukraine may very well be welcomed into the EU. Are we to believe that Ukraine is more in line with the EU’s values? Can one not support them in their current plight while acknowledging that they are a dysfunctional state in need of serious reform?

None of this is to comment on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but to see the EU’s duplicity in all of it. They just punished the two countries actually doing something to help Ukraine and having the most to lose.

In addition to taking the side of Ukrainians, Americans following this conflict should take the side of the Hungarians and Polish. Not only are they seeking higher ground in this conflict between two neighboring nations, but they are doing the same in the conflict with an increasingly intolerant, anti-liberal European Union.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/15/while-vilifying-putin-the-eu-punishes-democracy-in-hungary-and-poland/,2022-03-15
Covid Isn't Over Until Every Official Who Abused It Is Held Accountable,"When Russia invaded Ukraine two weeks ago, some were quick to quip that Vladimir Putin had single-handedly killed Covid. As the story goes, worldwide collapse of public support for Covid restrictions, abysmal approval ratings for the Biden administration, and internal Democratic party polling warning of a political bloodbath in November necessitated a shift in the news cycle away from the pandemic. In characteristic lockstep, jurisdictions around the world began hastily walking back their mandates because, you know, science.

Putin’s war in Ukraine certainly provided a much-needed diversion from Covid woes. Yet we should not conclude that the unconscionable precepts underpinning the pandemic response have been definitively shelved, and content ourselves with gawking at the unfolding disaster in Eastern Europe. Indeed, the hoaxers who used the pandemic as an excuse to crush fundamental liberties are the same warmongers who want you riled up over Ukraine’s borders and transfixed by a regional dumpster fire that their own meddling, grubby hands have been pouring gasoline on for years.

Those behind the trucker convoy that has descended on D.C. have proven less easily distracted. As we mark the two-year anniversary of “15 days to slow the spread,” the truckers understand better than anyone that Covid is not dead until every child’s face is uncovered, every emergency order rescinded, every public health edict shredded, and every worker fired over vax mandates reinstated or compensated. To prevent the Covid cartel from ever pulling this stunt again, every lockdown-advocating, mask mandate-imposing, vax pass-wielding politician and public health mystic needs to answer for the destruction they have caused.

At a press briefing last week with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and representatives of the People’s Convoy, one reporter seemed confused as to the point of the truckers’ protest, given that many mandated have now been lifted. Even conservatives like The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh have superciliously questioned what difference any of this makes.

Cruz explained it this way: “It makes a difference to everyone who’s lost their jobs over these mandates.” For Johnson, it’s about “bringing the truth to the American public.” He argued that although “our response has been a miserable failure … the people that foisted this response on us … will never admit they were wrong.”

Clinging to their Power

Many of these tyrants are not only failing to acknowledge wrongdoing, they’re also not even conceding defeat. The White House has stated that President Joe Biden will veto any resolution passed by Congress to repeal the federal state of emergency, claiming “the virus continues to pose a risk,” and the federal government must “be prepared to respond to potential future variants.” The Biden administration also just extended the mask requirement for airlines and airports.

The trickle-down effect of this belligerent fear-mongering is evident in school districts nationwide, including San Francisco and Boston, as well as institutions like George Mason University, that still cling to mandates. New York City Mayor Eric Adams just announced that masks will continue to be required for all settings for children younger than five. Worse, the city’s new color-coded system for the Covid alert level reveals that lockdowns are very much still on the table.

Elsewhere in the world, repeals of mandates conceal sneaky clauses permitting future draconian action if the despots so choose. Austria has already announced a U-turn on its egregious general vaccine mandate, which would have entailed roughly $4,000 fines for adults who refused to comply. Yet EU Minister Karoline Edtstadler emphasized this is only a temporary suspension, which allows the legal framework to be “kept in place in case another, more dangerous variant became dominant in the future.”

Similarly in Germany, where authorities announced the lifting of Covid restrictions by March 20, masks and testing will still be mandatory in some settings and individual states can continue to impose vax passes. The new legislation is supposed to guard against future waves.

Indeed, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach warned on Friday that the pandemic was certainly not over, the situation in Germany was critical, and the easing of restrictions was to blame for the record high daily case numbers. He also speculated that without a general vaccine mandate, autumn could bring a new surge of infections, a view shared by Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

This Covid forever hysteria is by no means confined to outliers. One hundred and thirty politicians, officials, Hollywood A-listers, and other grifters just signed an open letter insisting that the pandemic is not over, warning western leaders against complacency, and urging more spending on vaccines, testing, and PPE.

This attitude underscores the argument by People’s Convoy spokesman Brian Brase that this is not just an American but a global issue, describing it as “a renaissance of freedom.” States of emergency and mandates must be rescinded worldwide, and investigations launched into the public health measures adopted by our elected and non-elected officials. If not, the pandemic campaign will continue, with a continually-stocked arsenal of variants, surges, and boosters serving as weapons with which to dominate populations and punish dissenters.

There Must Be a Reckoning

It was never the prerogative of politicians, health agencies, and international organizations to snatch our rights away. Enormous suffering has been inflicted as a result, and the working and middle classes throughout the world are shouldering the burden of this outrage.

A 2020 UNICEF analysis projected that an additional 150 million children will be plunged into multidimensional poverty. UNICEF’s latest findings, using data from 35 countries, revealed that at least 68 percent of households with children have lost income since the start of the lockdowns. Roughly a quarter of adults living with children reported going without food for a day or longer. Among households with children who were attending school before the pandemic, only one-half reported children participating in any educational activities after authorities shut down schools.

Here in the United States, where millions of students were forced out of their classrooms for the better part of a year, studies warn of serious language and literacy deficits among children in the earliest grades. The long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical impact of muzzling our little ones against their will, including elementary school students, toddlers, the hearing impaired, and other special-needs children for several hours a day may never be fully comprehended.

Those who crowed about an overall 5 percent drop in U.S. suicides for 2020, did not seem particularly concerned by indicators that suicides for blacks and Latinos surged during that period. Another sobering statistic is the 30 percent jump in drug overdoses during 2020 to an estimated 93,331 deaths, the highest number ever recorded in a 12-month period.

Thousands of Americans have lost their jobs thanks to vax mandates, despite the admission by Centers for Disease Control Director Rochelle Walensky that vaccines do not prevent transmission and revelations the CDC has been withholding key data on vaccine and booster efficacy. Late last year, the largest health care provider in New York fired 1,400 doctors and nurses who didn’t want the injection.

Corporations including Google, Facebook, Tyson Foods, Verizon, Nike and Columbia Sportswear have all imposed vaccination requirements for staff. Even a Catholic Priest in Vermont, who has served as pastor of his parish for two decades, was just dismissed by his bishop for resisting the diocese’s intrusive vax and mask policy.

Now the authors of this debacle expect us to ignore the wreckage and ogle at Ukraine, or whatever freakshow they parade before us next, while they get to withhold and dispense freedoms as they desire, whenever the political moment is right.

Covid will not be “killed” by Putin’s war in Ukraine, or any other impeccably timed, amnesia-inducing catastrophe. It will be destroyed by ditching the fake science and superstition, recognizing the people’s sovereignty over their own lives, and holding accountable the gang of self-serving officials and petty tyrants who spent two years crushing us.

‘Faith With Feet And Hands’: Christians Bring Hope To Ukraine’s War Zone,"In the first 10 days of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, people I know there tell me, almost 400 babies took their first breaths in the capital city of Kyiv. Grocery shelves are still being re-stocked. Food is not being hoarded. Neighbors are helping neighbors.

Behind the scenes of Ukrainian resistance stands the church as a small but potent force punching above its weight. The church in Ukraine has galvanized support for freedom and democracy for three decades. Now it is intimately involved in both war and humanitarian efforts across the country.

One example tells a story being repeated in many places in Ukraine. An IT professional named Anatoly also ran his church’s media ministry. After evacuating his wife and family members to a neighboring country, he returned to serve with the church in the heavily-bombed city of Irpin.

A week ago, Anatoly volunteered to carry the suitcases of a young mother and her two children across the bridge to safety. All four were reportedly killed by a Russian bomb as they tried to cross, in what is supposed to be a humanitarian corridor to safety.

The Church Is on the Front Lines, Too

Indeed, there is no part of the Ukrainian resistance where the church has not been a major catalyst of influence and support. Churches still gather weekly to worship and pray. After the service, they put together Molotov cocktails for civilian defense.

Still, church leaders admitted they were shocked when Vladimir Putin invaded the country on Feb. 24. The Russian army had been contained for years in Ukraine’s eastern sector, although every year Putin assembled soldiers rattling sabers in military exercises.

“The mask is off now,” explained Sasha M., who leads a ministry team near Kyiv, to me recently. “This is evil undisguised.” Some Christians in Ukraine view the struggle with Russia as a recreation of the epic story of David and Goliath. They believe this war is Ukraine’s last chance to get rid of Russian aggression. “Putin tries to bring us ‘Russian freedom,’ but no one wants it,” said a Baptist pastor in Bila.

When full-scale war broke out three weeks ago, Ukrainian pastors with connections in the West had the opportunity to take their families and evacuate. Nick and Maia Mikhaluk head a church-planting network throughout Ukraine. They encouraged each pastor to weigh carefully his decision to stay in-country. Only two of nearly 20 have left. “If I leave, this will be very demoralizing for my people,” one pastor explained.

Ukrainian pastors and church members are involved daily in meeting overwhelming humanitarian needs. The largest Protestant church south of Kyiv houses and feeds 30-50 refugees every night. Church members host refugees and “territorial defense units” in their homes throughout the country. They drive people hiding under bridges in heavily bombed places like Irpin to safety. As one female chaplain said, “I lost 11 people I knew personally in the last few days, but I had to move on, the needs are so great.”

The Church Is a Source of Strength

One fascinating piece of unpublicized history provides a few clues to the growth of Christianity and its outsized influence in the formerly atheist Soviet country. When the Soviet wall fell, the minister of Education invited Christian groups in the west to come and teach “Christian morality and ethics” in Russian and Ukrainian public schools.

So more than 1,800 Americans and Canadians spent a year teaching in public schools in all 68 Russian and Ukrainian oblasti (states), trained by groups like one my husband directed. Russians seemed acutely aware then that the cause of their suffering under Communism was accurately identified by the heroic Russian figure, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: “Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.”

When Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 1999, he quickly expelled western missionaries from Russia. He began to stifle Christianity again. In an ominous sign, a suspected ex-KGB crony of Putin was appointed the Moscow patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. The handwriting was on the wall, so many Christian leaders migrated south to Ukraine.

When war broke out in 2014 in the eastern section of Ukraine, 55,000 men every three months were recruited to the front. They lacked ammunition, supplies, and even food and water. Jeff Laughlin, an American who organized training for Ukrainian chaplains for more than a decade, explained how vital the church has been to the war effort.

“The government was too poorly organized to keep up with the needs of these soldiers, so commanders of units would contact individual churches who raised the money to equip them,” he told me. Many pastors went to the front as chaplains for the army. A church that had been taught to be passive began to take great risks. As one pastor explained, “It’s better theology to defend the country. Either we do this together or we are history.”

Now that nightly bombing and shelling have made it nearly impossible to meet on Sundays in many cities, the church has been forced to go to the people. In the first days of the invasion, Archbishop Shevchuk of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church emphasized the church’s determination to bring the Mass to Ukrainians while they took shelter.

“Our priests will descend to the underground, they will descend to the bomb shelters, and there they will celebrate the Divine Liturgy,” he proclaimed in a video message. “The church is with its people!”

When The War Is Over

Ukrainian church leaders have few illusions that this war will be over soon. The Russian army appears to have outrun its initial supplies, and is now raiding the countryside. Many of Putin’s first recruits have reportedly been young conscripts, poorly motivated.

Ukrainians believe there is a massive assault coming. They also hope help of some sort will come from the West, and there’s anger that our response has been so weak. Our dependence on Russian oil is viewed as paying Russia to kill Ukrainians. Yet for good or for ill, Ukrainians have cast their lot with us.

One thing seven years of war in the eastern section of Ukraine have revealed is how important the church’s presence is. Church planter Maia Mikaluk insists the Slavic people are not impressed with ideology. “They need to see faith with feet and hands,” she said. “In hardship, this is when people turn their eyes to God.” Even if the war ended today, church leaders know there is a huge work of rebuilding ahead of them. More people will be destitute.

For now, their fight is one of survival. “At times, the fear just washes over you,” Maia said. People warn her that her name must be on a Russian “black list.” Her reply? I’ve been there for years. I’m certainly not going to stop now.

Every night Maia and her husband sleep in the hallway of a local bomb shelter with their son-in-law and daughter, who is 40 weeks pregnant with their first grandchild. They hope to make it to a hospital 10 minutes away when the baby begins to come. They hope the hospital will still be standing.

"If China's Pushing For US Involvement In Ukraine, Assume It's A Bad Idea","Image Credit Dong Fang/Wikimedia Commons

As the Russian onslaught against Ukraine continues, the Chinese state media has become the latest political entity to advocate for U.S. intervention in the conflict, including a push for troops on the ground and the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Following a virtual speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, Hu Xijin of the Chinese Communist Party’s Global Times began pushing for direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, saying the U.S. shouldn’t “just incite Ukrainians to die for American interest.”

“Just applause? it’s hypocritical,” said Xijin in a tweet responding to members of Congress giving Zelensky a standing ovation. “If the US really wants to show justice, it should send troops to Ukraine, or at least set up a no-fly zone, and fight Putin’s troops directly, even [if] that means sacrifice of US soldiers.”

Just applause? it’s hypocritical. If the US really wants to show justice, it should send troops to Ukraine, or at least set up a no-fly zone, and fight Putin’s troops directly, even that means sacrifice of US soldiers. Don’t just incite Ukrainians to die for American interest https://t.co/urOtDPQ7lt — Hu Xijin 胡锡进 (@HuXijin_GT) March 16, 2022

In his speech to Congress, Zelensky not only begged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to install a no-fly zone over his country, but also invoked some of the most historically horrific attacks on America to manipulate Congress into supporting such a policy.

“Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Americans, in your great history, you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us right now, when we need you right now,” he said. “Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the plains attacking you. Just remember it.”

Zelensky went on to compare the Russian invasion of his country to the deadly terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. “Remember September the 11th, a terrible day in 2001, when evil try to turn your cities, independent territories into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked,” he said, in a plea encouraging U.S. lawmakers to make emotion-based foreign policy decisions.

A no-fly zone would require NATO to “prohibit Russian warplanes from flying through Ukrainian airspace,” which would mean NATO fighter jets engaging and shooting down “any Russian aircraft they encountered.” These actions would also leave the door open for possible Russian retaliation, which could lead to further U.S. military intervention in the region.

China’s call for U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine isn’t based on any form of compassion for the Ukrainian people, but rather on geopolitical interests. Given Chairman Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) aim of making China a regional hegemon in the Indo-Pacific, it would strategically benefit them to have the United States occupied with fighting Russia in Eastern Europe.

With the attention of the United States directed towards the European continent, China would assuredly utilize such a conflict to advance its geopolitical goals throughout the region. In addition to allowing for greater military pressure on Taiwan, U.S. preoccupation with a war in Europe could provide Beijing with the opportunity to further expand its growing political and economic authority throughout the Asia Pacific region.

According to a 2020 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the United States is already falling behind China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia, with the results of the survey “paint[ing] a picture of clearly ascendant Chinese influence in Southeast Asia, complex and diverging views of China, and deep concerns over U.S.-China strategic competition and its impact on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).”

The responses from the various Southeast Asian nations were, however, collected prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China.

So, while America’s political leadership may feel inclined to embroil our country in another endless war, China’s push for U.S. military engagement in Ukraine should serve as a wakeup call to Washington’s elite that such a policy prescription is a disaster waiting to occur.

Polls Show ‘Bidenflation’ Is Killing Democrats With Minority Voters,"As the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Markets Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday to consider the fate of American monetary policy, they should consider the plight of people like Roger Stephens. The retired airline mechanic who lives in a Los Angeles neighborhood recently told a reporter inflation is taking a toll on his lifestyle.

Referring to the president, he commented that “Uncle Joe has put us on a diet….I like to have steak once or twice a month. I can’t do it now.”

A Wall Street Journal poll out this week shows Stephens’ situation mirrors those of millions of families across the country. Out-of-control federal spending and loose monetary policy are definitely having an effect—but not in the way Democrats promised. While people like Joe Biden remain firmly ensconced in their palatial estates, the working class continues to suffer from the harmful effects of leftist policies.

Disproportionate Impact

The poll results should make for bracing reading for Democrats, because they show how the party’s policies have not only harmed the economy, but alienated their political base. For starters, notwithstanding the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, twice as many voters (50%) consider “inflation and the economy” the top priority for the president and Congress as the Ukraine conflict (25%). (Only 5 percent of voters consider Covid the top priority issue.)

Nonwhite voters (60%) listed inflation as a top priority by a higher margin than white voters (47%), quite possibly because they reported suffering from inflation’s effects in greater numbers. A total of 35% of non-white voters in the Journal poll said inflation is “creating major financial strains” for their family, compared to the same from 28% of white voters. African American women and Hispanic men demonstrated the highest rate of major financial strains for their families, at 44 percent.

Just as telling: “Almost half [of respondents] with incomes of less than $60,000 reported major financial strain, while just 13% of those making $150,000 or more did so.” In other words, while elites in Washington—home to some of the wealthiest counties in the United States—face little discomfort from skyrocketing prices, ordinary families are getting their proverbial teeth kicked in every time they head to the grocery store or try to fill up at the pump.

Democratic Base Fracturing

Little wonder then that people like Stephens, an African American who voted twice for Barack Obama, “said he was more likely to back Republicans than Democrats in this year’s [congressional] election.” He has plenty of company. The Journal poll found that nearly three-quarters (71%) of independent voters think the economy has gotten off on the wrong track; almost four in five Hispanics (78%) take that view.

Because nonwhite voters have soured on Biden’s economic policies, the Democratic coalition could face a crack-up come November. Democrats’ lead on the generic congressional ballot among African Americans has shrunk by a whopping 21 percentage points just in the four months since the Journal’s last poll. Just as surprising, Republicans now hold a nine-point lead among Hispanics, 46 percent to 37 percent.

The poll results should shock Democratic consultants who for years believed in the mantra of “demography is destiny”—that growth of non-white populations would guarantee them political power for years and decades to come. Doubtless those consultants didn’t anticipate the way Biden’s policies would crush working-class households of all colors, in a way that could cause them to abandon the Democratic Party.

SOS: Stop Over Spending

Over the past year-plus, voters have gotten a (re-)education in the fact that the left’s big-government policies end up harming the populations that leftists claim to want to help. Yet, while the American people have seen how government spending and printing money leads to sky-high inflation, most (but thankfully not all) Democratic lawmakers still want to ram a $5 trillion spending bill through Congress that would raise inflation still higher.

Here’s hoping that the Federal Reserve has—after more than a year of dithering—finally come to its senses. Beginning the process of raising interest rates, and shutting the (metaphorical) printing presses that have created money for the past two years of the pandemic, would begin the long process of restoring some stability into fiscal policy in Washington—and the budgets of ordinary American families.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/16/polls-show-bidenflation-is-killing-democrats-with-minority-voters/,2022-03-16
Washington Ramps Up Campaign To Draw NATO Into War With Russia,"By now it should be obvious that a concerted and bipartisan effort is underway in Washington to escalate U.S. involvement in the Ukraine war. This effort has been ongoing since the war began three weeks ago, but now it’s entering a new and dangerous phase.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, a half-dozen top Republican lawmakers called for the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with “Soviet- or Russian-made strategic and tactical air defense systems and associated radars to Ukraine.”

That means long-range surface-to-air missiles, like the Soviet-made S-300 system, which is designed to shoot down enemy aircraft and intercept ballistic missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the United States to help Ukraine acquire S-300 air defense systems from countries that have them, like North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members Bulgaria, Greece, and Slovakia, and he might do so again on Wednesday when he addresses Congress.

In action, S-300 air defense systems look something like this:

The provision of such heavy weaponry to Ukraine, whether by the United States or our NATO allies, would represent an unprecedented level of direct military support for Ukraine that would undoubtedly — and rightly — be interpreted by Moscow as a sharp escalation by the West.

Top Republican lawmakers, though, are undeterred by such concerns. The letter, signed by GOP Sens. James Inhofe, Marco Rubio, James Risch, and Reps. Mike Rogers, Michael Turner, and Michael McCaul, also calls for an array of other weapons to be sent immediately to Ukraine, including more Javelin antitank and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, which the United States has been providing to Ukraine in large quantities, as well as myriad small arms, ammunition, and other supplies.

It also calls for the delivery to Ukraine of Polish MiG-29 fighter jets “in the near term,” and for the United States to “re-engage Warsaw” on ways to backfill those aircraft. The Republican signatories then declare: “We encourage the department to re-evaluate the flawed conclusion that the transfer of these fighter jets to Ukraine would be ‘escalatory’ in comparison to the weapons systems that have already been delivered to Ukraine by the U.S. and our allies and partners.”

On the contrary, it would indeed be escalatory simply because the weapons that have already been delivered to Ukraine are nothing compared to, say, dozens of advanced fighter jets. Poland certainly considers such a course of action “escalatory.”

After all, the entire fighter jet transfer scheme was abandoned last week when Poland, responding to some loose talk from Blinken about giving a “green light” to the transfer, offered to deploy its MiG-29s to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and place them at the disposal of the United States. Poland was essentially asking the United States to bear the risks of sending fighter jets into Ukraine, which Moscow would almost certainly consider an act of war. The Biden administration, recognizing these risks, declined Poland’s offer.

None of this seems to daunt these Republican lawmakers, though. They seem to think we should press ahead and arm the Ukrainians with everything short of NATO soldiers and nuclear weapons. The idea of sending long-range surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine is essentially identical to the MiG-29 transfer idea: funnel advanced weapons systems to Ukraine but somehow maintain the fiction that the United States and NATO are non-belligerents. At some point, we will cross the line of belligerence, and whether and when we cross that line isn’t something we alone get to decide.

It’s not enough, as these GOP lawmakers are doing, to wave away the risks that such policies carry. Moscow clearly views this war as existential, and it will not simply allow NATO to funnel increasingly more powerful weapons into Ukraine. As I argued last week, this isn’t Afghanistan or Syria. Controlling Ukraine is central to Moscow’s conception of its national security, and it won’t simply walk away from this war without widening it first.

Lawmakers in Washington aren’t the only ones who refuse to see this. Open the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal these days and you’ll see the same kind of hand-waving over the risks of escalation. On Tuesday, the Journal published an op-ed by Douglas Feith and John Hannah (along with a supporting editorial) that argued for a “humanitarian airlift” for Ukraine without acknowledging the risks involved.

What, exactly, would that look like? An international airlift, openly organized and funded by the United States, would “provide food, medicine and other nonmilitary supplies for days, weeks and maybe longer,” write Feith and Hannah, who both served as national-security officials in the George W. Bush administration. “Countries viewed as not hostile to Russia — perhaps Brazil, Egypt, India and the United Arab Emirates — could take the lead in flying planes into Ukraine.”

But since NATO and the United States aren’t willing to impose a no-fly zone (yet) it’s hard to imagine pilots from those non-NATO countries will be lining up to volunteer for the mission. What happens if they get shot down?

Feith and Hannah don’t say. Russian President Vladimir Putin, they argue, “would either consent and facilitate distribution of supplies or provoke more denunciations of Russia for its inhumanity.” Or he might shoot down a supply plane, launch a missile attack on the NATO airbase where the airlift is based, or do any number of things to widen the war in response.

Feith and Hannah, along with the Journal’s editorial board, make no serious attempt to grapple with the risks involved in such an operation, let alone the potential for rapid escalation once things go sideways. Like the aforementioned Republican lawmakers, they refuse to engage in even the most rudimentary risk analysis.

Why? One possible explanation is that perhaps the people making these arguments want the United States to get involved as a belligerent, and don’t really believe their hand-waving about the risks associated with their schemes. Feith and Hannah, for example, laughably assert that there is “little to no downside” to their proposal, which they also note “doesn’t preclude efforts to arm the Ukrainians better, or eventually to establish a no-fly zone, but because the airlift is far less risky it should be more readily doable.”

Well, yes, a humanitarian airlift into an active warzone is certainly less risky than a no-fly zone, which is indistinguishable from going to war with Russia, but that doesn’t mean it’s risk-free, much less prudent. But maybe that’s the point: dial up the risk and see what happens.

As the war in Ukraine stretches into its third week, with heavy Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities intensifying and civilian causalities mounting, we’re going to hear more and more arguments out of Washington that the United States and NATO need to do more, that we can’t stand aside and let Putin do as he pleases in Ukraine. The people making these arguments will deny that their proposals for aiding Ukraine, however unprecedented, could risk escalation with or retaliation from Moscow. They will not even engage that question in good faith.

Instead, they will insist, with the force of what they believe is moral authority, that we keep plunging down a slippery slope that eventually leads to war between NATO and Russia — and that we do so without even acknowledging what we’re doing.

Why Is Putin Talking About ‘De-Nazifying’ Ukraine?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has proffered, as one of his rationales for invading Ukraine, the need to “de-Nazify” the nation. Russian propaganda, some people sympathetic to it, and others perhaps well-meaning, points to the Azov Battalion in Ukraine as proof of that nation’s Nazi leanings.

To preface this discussion, it’s important to put into context what Putin means by de-Nazification. Both the Nazis under Hitler and the Soviet Union, especially in the early years under Lenin, emphasized national identity.

Because the Soviet Union sought to be a global communist empire, it anticipated a host of Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) for everybody: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and even Germany, Hungary, and the rest of Europe. Under this construct, the SSRs would be united in their international communist ideology, but unique in their national identity. In this, Lenin and later generations of Kremlin leaders, rightly surmised that the larger an empire is, the more leeway it must grant its provinces, at the risk of fomenting rebellion.

It was in this early time of the U.S.S.R.’s history that Ukraine saw a resurgence of its language, literature, and national identity after decades of Russification under the Tsars.

Thus, when Putin speaks of de-Nazification, what he really means is to Russify — to return to the age of the Tsars circa the 1860s, when Russia imposed a 40-year ban on the publication of books and newspapers in Ukrainian.

About Those Neo-Nazis

Putin’s insular view of what it means to be de-Nazified aside, there appear to be some actual armed neo-Nazis in Ukraine in the form of the Azov Battalion. What is the Azov Battalion and how did it come into being? Just as importantly, is it uniquely Ukrainian, or are there similar groups elsewhere?

In late 2013, as Ukraine’s fourth president, the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych, approached his fourth year of a five-year term, political unrest — known as the Euromaidan protests — grew out of a public desire for closer integration with the European Union rather than Russia. By February 2014, Yanukovych had fled to Russia while Russia was invading Crimea and sending Russian officers to the Donbas Basin provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, in Ukraine’s east.

In the chaos of 2014, the Ukrainian military, which had been left in disrepair and hobbled by corruption and cronyism, was wholly inadequate to the task of defending the nation. Crimea fell almost without a shot, while Donetsk and Luhansk were rapidly brought under de facto Russian control. Mariupol, the second-largest city in Donetsk with some 430,000 residents, was abandoned under pressure by Ukrainian government forces in May 2014.

But five weeks later, government forces, including the Azov Battalion, retook the city. Three months later, the Russian-backed separatists of the Donetsk People’s Republic tried again to take Mariupol, and again, the Azov Battalion played a leading role in keeping the city under Ukrainian control.

At the time, the Azov Battalion’s insignia and the ideology of its leadership and rank-and-file wer openly neo-Nazi. The unit was also accused of war crimes, including using torture on their Russian-backed enemy. When confronted with the similarity between the Azov Battalion’s unit patch and that of the German Nazi 2nd SS Panzer Division, Azov officials denied the connection, claiming that their symbol is an abbreviation for the slogan “National Idea.” (In Ukrainian, the letters “H” and “I” are tilted to the right by 45 degrees.)

Chris Joyner, writing for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on March 4, quoted Prof. David Malet, an expert on transnational fighters with the School of Public Affairs at American University, who noted that as the Ukrainian military gained proficiency, it sought to tame the Azov Battalion and discourage foreign extremists from volunteering in Ukraine. Malet told Joyner, “A lot of Russian propaganda has focused on Nazi ties, trying to paint all the volunteers in Ukraine as Nazis, when again it’s probably been a pretty good mix of it on both sides.”

Of course, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish, as was the nation’s previous prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. This led Hans Jakob-Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, to sarcastically note of Putin’s claims of Ukraine as a Nazi state was, “apparently, a very new kind of Nazi that only a Russian understands how that works.”

Reinforcing Groysman’s view, the 450-member Ukrainian parliament, or Rada, only has one member from a party accused of neo-Nazi leanings. Svoboda, founded in 1991 at the dissolution of the Soviet Union, recruited skinheads and employed neo-Nazi symbols in the 1990s, only to later moderate. It reached its apex in the 2012 election, winning 10 percent of the vote and 37 seats. In the 2019 election, Svoboda received only 2 percent of the vote.

Returning to Malet, his contention that there’s a “good mix” of neo-Nazi-like groups in both Ukraine and Russia is important for context.

Putin has his own ultra-nationalist groups. For instance, in 2014, a Russian motorcycle gang with close Putin ties known as the “Night Wolves,” was used as the vanguard of the Crimea invasion — inaugurating a new era of so-called “hybrid warfare.” By streaming into Crimea, the Night Wolves showed that the Ukrainian central government was powerless. The gang’s ideology is based on contempt for a decadent and rootless West with its leader Alexander Zaldostanov admitting that “death to faggots” might be an appropriate motto.

The Rise of Neo-Paganism

In some sense, the rise of nationalism has paced the rise of globalism and the subsequent disorienting displacements of work and dilution of culture. One reaction to this can be seen in the concurrent rise of neo-paganism.

When I enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1983, I never saw pagan symbology. By the time I retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Army National Guard in 2007, it was noticeable, but not yet widespread. Interestingly, when I toured Folsom Prison in 2006 while a member of the California State Assembly, the prison chaplain told us the two fastest-growing faiths behind bars were Islam and Wicca, the latter being a revival of paganism.

There is a certain logic in this. Christianity is a global faith, making no distinction between people. Further, Christianity teaches forgiveness, to love one’s enemy, and to turn the other cheek. In the context of the profession of arms — or the dangerous reality of being incarcerated — Christianity may be seen by some as weak, whereas paganism can appeal to a warrior ethos.

Insofar as Ukraine and Putin’s Nazi accusations against the nation, the question is whether actual Nazis with real animus towards the Jewish people and other minorities can gain a foothold and use their power to persecute people. This prospect appears vanishingly small, and, if Ukraine survives as an independent nation, even less so.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/16/why-is-putin-talking-about-de-nazifying-ukraine/,2022-03-16
The Press Lied To Drag Us Into War Before. Don't Think They Won't Again,"The night of Feb. 15, 1898, the U.S. battleship Maine sat at anchor in Havana, Cuba. A few minutes after 9 p.m., the nightly ritual of “Taps” from Fifer C. H. Newton’s bugle descended over the ship. Some half an hour later, the forward end of the ship rose suddenly above the water.

“Along the pier, passersby could hear a rumbling explosion,” detailed author Tom Miller. “Within seconds, another eruption — this one deafening and massive — splintered the bow, sending anything that wasn’t battened down, and most that was, flying more than 200 feet into the air.”

The explosion, which killed more than 250 men on board, was quickly memorialized with cries of “Remember the Maine!” Without directly accusing Spain, which controlled Cuba at the time, a U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry decided a month later that the explosion was from a mine. (A U.S. Navy investigation decades later found it was likely an accidental coal bunker fire.)

Shortly afterward, the United States declared war on Spain, starting the Spanish-American War. One of the biggest warmongering forces in America, capitalizing on the Maine‘s explosion, was the press — a position American media pundits continue to hold as they work overtime to drag Americans into a war with Russia over Ukraine.

When you see talking heads uncritically parroting propagandist stories about Ukraine that turn out to be false, from the “Ghost of Kyiv” to that Snake Island story to old photos taken years ago, you should be asking why the corporate media is so willing to spread such fake news (while it censors conservatives for factual critiques of disproven Covid narratives, no less). It wouldn’t be the first time the press lied to pull Americans into war.

How Newspapermen Helped Start a War in Cuba

It was the so-called golden age of newspapers, after the influence of the Industrial Revolution gave rise to the “penny press” — newspapers you could buy at the street corner without a subscription. Competing magnates like William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer fought for readers, and they did so by trying to produce the most sensational news possible.

As the story goes, in the year before the Maine exploded, Hearst had commissioned reporter Frederic Remington to go to Cuba, where Cuban revolutionaries were skirmishing with their Spanish colonizers. When Remington sent Hearst a wire to explain he was leaving Cuba because there was no war to cover, Hearst reportedly replied, “You furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war.”

After the sinking of the Maine, headlines like “Spanish Treachery!” and “Destruction of the War Ship Maine Was the Work of an Enemy!” and “Invasion!” and “Who Destroyed the Maine? $50,000 Reward” splashed across front pages. The United States went to war in April, two months after the Maine perished.

The media’s eagerness to gin up a war mirrored the push for involvement from other voices in politics and culture. Some Americans had sympathy for Spanish-owned Cuba as fellow colonial revolutionaries, while others wanted to see U.S. influence and territory expand internationally.

Half a century prior, when the phrase “manifest destiny” was being coined, the United States had gone to war with Mexico over Texas but also ended the war with acquisitions of what is now California, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. By 1898, the United States had purchased Alaska from Russia and claimed several Pacific islands.

Many Americans saw a similar opportunity for territorial expansion in a fight with Spain over Cuba. Sure enough, the United States exited the Spanish-American War with new acquisitions from Guam to the Philippines to Puerto Rico.

While the warmongers weren’t limited to the press, they were certainly concentrated there. The State Department Office of the Historian writes: “Hearst and Pulitzer devoted more and more attention to the Cuban struggle for independence, at times accentuating the harshness of Spanish rule or the nobility of the revolutionaries, and occasionally printing rousing stories that proved to be false.” Sound familiar?

A Century of Dishonesty

“Remember the Maine!” may have been at the height of the yellow journalism era, but it was certainly not the last instance of dishonest reporting in favor of sensational warmongering. During the Spanish Civil War, which saw Nationalist revolutionaries clash with Republicans in the years directly preceding World War II, some Western outlets were criticized for covering the conflict sensationally. The New York Times devoted far more manpower to the war than papers at the time traditionally did, with “highly partisan” perspectives.

George Orwell, who fought alongside Republican forces, wrote in his memoir “Homage to Catalonia” that “for the first time, I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie.”

“I saw great battles reported where there had been no fighting, and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed. I saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors, and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as heroes of imaginary victories; and I saw newspapers in London retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional superstructures over events that never happened,” he recalled. “I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various ‘party lines.’”

Newspaper propagandists’ willingness to cover wars in self-interested ways didn’t always run in the same direction, either. Orwell’s contemporary and fellow writer Ernest Hemingway had similar criticism for propagandist writers who downplayed the carnage of World War I, insisting it was “the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that has ever taken place on earth. Any writer who said otherwise lied, So the writers either wrote propaganda, shut up, or fought.”

Later in the 20th century, The New York Times’ Berlin bureau chief Guido Enderis was providing friendly coverage of Hitler’s Germany, according to writer Ashley Rindsberg’s book “The Gray Lady Winked.” Meanwhile, the paper’s Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty, Rindsberg noted, was downplaying Joseph Stalin’s role in the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine because “at the time, The New York Times was actively pushing for American recognition of the Soviet Union.” President Franklin Roosevelt obliged, recognizing the USSR in 1933.

A more recent example is that of The New York Times and other corporate media outlets reporting baseless stories about the existence of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq to gin up support for President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. A year afterward, the Times editors admitted their lopsided reporting on the matter in a lengthy editorial piece.

“We have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been,” they wrote. “In some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged.”

“Administration officials now acknowledge that they sometimes fell for misinformation from these [Iraqi] exile sources. So did many news organizations — in particular, this one,” the editors continued. With the rapid dissemination of sensational photos, videos, and information via social media today, there’s no indication the corporate press is any less immune to disinformation when it fits their narrative.

When you see corporate outlets rushing us into war in Europe with sensational stories and flat-out dishonest polling, think twice. The corrupt media has lied to drag Americans into war before, and none of their recent lies on other issues should incline you to think they won’t do it again.

Will Joe Biden Oversee The Collapse Of The U.S. Dollar?,"Will Joe Biden oversee the collapse of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency? Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appears to think it’s a possibility, based on his recent quip: “It’s possible to have more than one reserve currency.” This is a staggering admission from the one person who wields the most influence over the dollar.

Then again, given the $30 trillion-and-counting federal debt, Powell’s comment should come as no surprise. Distilled, the chances are multiplying daily that the Biden administration is hurtling towards ringing the death-knell for the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.

The Wall Street Journal reported an exclusive on March 15 indicating another step towards the dollar’s loss of reserve currency status: Saudi Arabia is considering accepting yuan instead of dollars for oil sales to China. As the Journal noted, this “would dent the U.S. dollar’s dominance of the global petroleum market.”

It would be a profound shift for Saudi Arabia to price even some of its roughly 6.2 million barrels of day of crude exports in anything other than dollars. The majority of global oil sales—around 80%—are done in dollars, and the Saudis have traded oil exclusively in dollars since 1974, in a deal with the Nixon administration that included security guarantees for the kingdom.

Dropping the Dollar Would Hurt Americans Badly

Regardless of who the good guy is in the Russia-Ukraine conflict (if there is one), or what role the United States should play (if any), it’s vital to think through the consequences of the dollar losing its status as the world’s reserve currency. Simply, it would mean a dramatic drop in the standard of living and quality of life for middle-class Americans. For the world, it would mean a realignment of the global economic and financial order.

Reserve currency status means central banks around the world hold dollars in reserve, as an enormous amount of global trade is priced and conducted in dollars. For U.S. citizens, this means a greater quality of life and standard of living, at least in terms of purchasing and financing power, and greater incomes and general economic efficiency.

Reserve currency status also gives the United States a great amount of power and influence over world affairs. Amid the Russia-Ukraine war, Biden slapped economic sanctions on Russia, essentially denying Russia access to dollar reserves. In this, Biden has weaponized the dollar against Russia. Over the last decade or so, the United States has increasingly done likewise to countries that have failed to conform to the United States’s foreign policy goals.

The problem for the United States is, Russia and other countries are now looking for alternatives to the dollar. Sanctions coupled with the Fed’s massive inflation of the dollar supply since the economic crisis of 2008 ($25 trillion, including $9 trillion for the covid response), has shaken confidence in both the U.S. government and the dollar as the world reserve.

Many countries no longer trust the United States, and they are losing faith in the dollar as a stable medium of exchange and store of value. Simply put, the United States has abused the dollar’s standing as the world reserve.

The Fed Has Enabled the Dollar’s Destruction

For decades, reserve status has helped allow the Fed to inflate the supply of dollars. These are dollars backed by nothing, as President Richard Nixon severed the dollar’s convertibility to gold in 1971.

The Fed’s inflation of dollars has worked to destroy the purchasing power of the dollar, by increasing the prices of goods and services throughout the economy. Inflating the supply of dollars, along with artificially lowering interest rates, also sets the stage for boom-bust economic bubbles that crash into recessions.

The Fed’s dollar inflation acts as an invisible, pernicious tax on people who exchange in dollars, especially the poor, middle class, and those on fixed incomes (retirees). The U.S. government has also used inflation to fund its unsustainably enormous federal bureaucracy.

The growth of this welfare-warfare state has helped shake other nations’ confidence in the dollar, because it’s partly the Fed’s enabling of this state that has ballooned the U.S. national debt past $30 trillion. The welfare-warfare state adheres to the tried-and-true economic adage that “if you subsidize something, you get more of it.”

For decades, Congress has subsidized the welfare wing of the federal government, resulting in more Americans on welfare, for longer. Likewise with the warfare wing, or what President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned was the “military-industrial complex” more than half a century ago.

Funding Foreign Wars with Fake Money

It’s no secret that the more money the United States has poured into the warfare state, the more destructive military adventurism and wars of choice our leaders have committed the United States to. The recent examples of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya come to mind. It’s now clear we can add Ukraine to the list.

These kinds of “foreign entanglements” are exactly what the Founding Fathers warned us against. It would behoove Americans to remember what “not worth a continental” meant to the Founders, especially as in just the last two years alone, the United States has quadrupled the supply of dollars, which you can see in the chart below.

None of this has given pause to Congress, which just signed a $1.5 trillion funding bill last week, complete with $13.6 billion for Ukraine. It’s as if they’re destroying the dollar on purpose.

Serious Inflation Never Ends Well

This debasement of the dollar will not end well. It never does. Look to history. The collapses of all empires share a common thread: the inflationary destruction of their currencies, through government expansion; perpetual wars abroad; and bread-and-circuses and “let them eat cake” (or drive electric cars) on the home-front.

The United States had plenty of warnings over the years. Powell’s statement is mild in comparison to others. On the heels of the 2008 financial meltdown, Erskine Bowles, who led President Obama’s debt commission, said the obvious loud and clear: “I think today we face the most predictable economic crisis in history… I think it’s clear, if you do simple arithmetic, that the fiscal path that the nation is on is simply not sustainable… Deficits are like a cancer, and over time they are going to destroy our country from within.”

Since Bowles’ warning, the United States has more than doubled the national debt.

Even enemies of the United States have issued warnings. Osama bin Laden’s strategy of “Death by a Thousand Cuts” was to keep the United States in a permanent war, to economically bleed the United States dry over time. Of course, bin Laden’s dead. Nonetheless, his strategy is clearly still in play. The U.S. federal debt was some $6 trillion in 2001, as the United States commenced its “War on Terror.” Again, the national debt today is more than $30 trillion.

It’s been said that there are two ways to go bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. What can’t go on forever, suddenly won’t. So how close has Biden taken the United States to “suddenly”? We don’t want to find out.

There’s zero effective leadership from DC on the United States’s deficits, debt, and dollar madness. But’s it’s not too late. It’s just going to have to take a whole lot more Americans to focus on the issue to force our “leaders” to truly fix it.

The U.S. Is Mindlessly Marching Toward War With Russia,"The day after Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky addressed Congress, the American press was understandably filled with paeans to his courage and leadership, his clarity of purpose and firm resolve in the face of mortal danger. As Bari Weiss noted in a thoughtful response to the speech, Zelensky knows what he’s fighting for, and he stands as an inspiring counterexample of things we hope for in our own political leaders, but do not have.

But there is something else behind this celebration of Zelensky. His speech, after all, was a rather straightforward request for the United States and our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to intervene on behalf of Ukraine. “In the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,” he said, invoking Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and Martin Luther King, Jr.

He backed off, a little, from his repeated pleas for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and instead pressed for fighter jets and long-range surface-to-air missile systems — military aid of a kind that would be unprecedented, and would arguably bring the United States and NATO right up to and possibly over the line of belligerence.

Zelensky can’t really be faulted for wanting to draw the West into this war. He is trying to save his people, who are in desperate straits. But our leaders have a responsibility not to be pulled into the conflict, however unpopular that might be in the current media environment.

Instead, we’re seeing just the opposite: the emergence of a bipartisan, establishment consensus in Washington that the United States and NATO must ratchet up military aid to Ukraine, right now, without even trying to articulate an overarching strategy, what the off-ramps might be, or what an end-state to the conflict might look like.

On the same day as Zelensky’s speech, President Biden announced a new round of $800 million in antiaircraft weapons and other military equipment for Ukraine. That’s a small slice of the $14 billion in security aid to Ukraine that Congress recently passed as part of a massive spending bill. In a moment of rare bipartisanship, Congress is taking action. This is the bipartisan consensus at work. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., channeling the consensus, wants to send more of everything. “If it shoots, we should ship it,” he said.

Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., went a bit further on Thursday. During a rules committee hearing he blurted out, “We’re at war,” while talking about the need for a unified U.S. response to the conflict. Then, perhaps realizing his slip, quickly clarified that we’re not physically on the battlefield with the Ukrainians, “But we ought to do everything we possibly can to make sure they can meet this enemy and defeat this enemy.”

These lawmakers take the view that we can dance along a line of belligerence without actually becoming belligerents in the war, as if we alone get to decide where that line is and when we have or have not crossed it. They, along with their cheerleaders in the corporate press, offer no substantive arguments about why we won’t get drawn into the war. They simply declare that we have to do more, that we can’t be afraid of Moscow, without even attempting to persuade a skeptical American public that the risk inherent to doing more — getting into a shooting war with Russia — is worth it. They don’t even acknowledge the risk.

They need to. This isn’t a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iranian proxies in Yemen, or a civil war in Ethiopia. Russia is a nuclear power. It has tactical nuclear weapons that can be deployed on the battlefield. Its battlefield doctrine leaves room for their use. If western politicians are worried about what might happen if Russia wins, they need to consider what might happen if Russia starts losing, what Russian President Vladimir Putin might do if he thinks his war aims are slipping out of reach or that his regime is in danger.

That’s not to counsel appeasement, or to countenance Putin’s horrific bombardment of Ukrainian civilians. We can denounce Russian barbarism, and even continue aiding the Ukrainians, while maintaining a clear-eyed understanding of what’s possible in Ukraine, what’s not possible, and what the risks of escalation are for the United States and NATO.

Ukraine has fought valiantly, its people have done more to stymie the Russian invasion than anyone thought possible. The Ukrainians have paid a dear price for doing so, and as the war drags on, they will keep paying.

Western leaders can laude the courage of Zelensky and his people, but they also need to be honest with them. Washington should not assume that Putin will simply walk away from this war, or that he will accept a gradual defeat through the provision of NATO weapons and military aid to Ukraine. The assumption should be just the opposite: that Putin will widen the war if he thinks he’s losing it.

Seen that light, The United States is pursuing the most dangerous possible path right now by conveying confusion and irresoluteness to both Ukraine and Russia: devastating sanctions for Moscow but with no off-ramps or conditions for ending them; arms for Ukraine but not the kind or quantity that would turn the tide of war; contradictions and lack of coordination among the NATO allies, playing out in public for all the world to see.

This weak and desultory response to the war is partly why the United States is now marching mindlessly toward escalation, even if it’s not what President Biden intends. In many ways, Biden is being led by the nose. Top lawmakers in both parties, along with much of the corporate press, are talking themselves into going to war, and Biden is being carried along.

Even over the past 48 hours, there’s been a shift. The talk in Washington is no longer about sanctions on Russia or making Putin pay a price for Moscow’s aggression, but about how best to escalate our involvement and ensure a total and humiliating defeat of Russia, as if that’s a realistic end-state to this conflict.

But with apologies to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, this war isn’t going to end with Russia’s total defeat and complete withdrawal from Ukraine, or with Ukraine retaining its full independence and territorial integrity. It will not end with regime change in Moscow and Putin hauled before the Hague on war crimes charges. That is a fantasy.

Right now we need our leaders to be realistic, which means recognizing that at this point there really are only two courses of action available to the United States: we can urge Ukrainian leaders to negotiate and agree to some version of Moscow’s terms to end the war, as Israel has been trying to do, or we can continue down a slippery slope that eventually leads to war with Russia.

Without any deliberation or reflection, Washington is choosing the latter.

3 Corporate Media Gimmicks About Ukraine You Should Absolutely Ignore,"For much of the national news media, the situation in Ukraine isn’t about a deadly war involving a dangerous nuclear power so much as an opportunity to romanticize foreign conflict and signal their virtue.

That’s why it’s best to ignore a lot of what the media are saying, lest we find ourselves needlessly and irreversibly entangled in another costly, unwinnable struggle. Pro-war columnists and cable news people on the left and right are as excited as ever to push America to “do more” for Ukraine, even if it does nothing to advance our own national interests.

Avoiding that kind of manipulation isn’t hard if you simply ignore these three things:

Any journalist or talking head swept up by the sight of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a T-shirt. Zelensky has become an emotional hero for so many of these people and the mere image of him apparently makes their insides ache for more war. Last week, after Zelensky’s televised address to Congress pleading for additional military support, MSNBC host Jonathan Lemire, who is also White House bureau chief for Politico, could hardly contain himself. “Zelensky there, who has emerged as this really heroic figure,” he said, “there in his trademark t-shirt, on the front lines, a wartime leader…” The Washington Post’s Kathleen Parker has been similarly worked into a gooey mess, referring to the Ukrainian president as “the modern-day warrior-artist,” and “an Everyman in his trademark T-shirt and half-zip.” People who think about war in corny feel-good symbols can’t be taken seriously. All appeals to ideals of “democracy” and “freedom.” That much of Ukraine’s population is truly trying to be a free and democratic country is a good thing but that doesn’t make that nation’s problems our problems by default and it’s not a reason for America to promise unlimited military support in the fight. On March 10, the New Republic ran the headline, “We Must Defend Democracy in Ukraine—and Win It at Home Too.” E.J. Dionne Jr. in The Washington Post suggested that “Vladimir Putin’s aggression has, at long last, unleashed a come-to-democracy moment.” It’s all an attempt to assert that our own affairs are inextricably linked with the fate of Ukraine and that to suggest otherwise is anti-democratic. Well, no, it might just be an admission that we can’t recreate the world in our image and attempts of the very recent past have been disastrous. Every TV segment featuring Alexander Vindman. For weeks now, news shows have invited Vindman on air to say we should “do more” in Ukraine, or some variation thereof. You’ll recall Vindman as the government worker who took it upon himself to instigate a president’s impeachment because he didn’t think that president was sufficiently dedicated to the wellbeing of Ukraine. What else would he say? At the start of Russia’s invasion, he said on CBS, “There’s more that we need to be doing.” Last week, he said on MSNBC, “Our approach to supporting Ukraine is too incremental. … They need more.” Vindman has long made clear his personal devotion to Ukraine. He has signaled a desire for the U.S., along with NATO allies, to institute a no-fly zone, which would involve shooting down Russian aircraft. There is nothing he isn’t willing to risk, despite being in no position to risk anything himself.

Pay no attention to those three things, and what our position should be on the Ukraine-Russia war is a lot clearer.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/21/3-corporate-media-shticks-about-ukraine-that-you-should-absolutely-ignore/,2022-03-21
Congress Wants To Charge You Billions For Earmarks And Call It A Budget,"Vladamir Putin isn’t the only one seeking to fulfill corrupt ambitions while Joe Biden is asleep at the wheel of his presidency. Congress recently passed another omnibus spending package. It left taxpayers scratching their heads, while D.C. insiders and career politicians laugh their way to the bank, thanks to the 367-page surplus of earmark spending requests included in the bill totaling approximately $4 billion.

The $1.5 trillion government funding bill signed into law by President Biden is six months late and packed with nonsensical, state-specific projects for which federal taxpayers should not be on the hook. Congress has hedged its bet, hoping that the American public will be too distracted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the aid the bill sends Ukraine to notice lawmakers’ dubious attempt to snatch their tax dollars for things like lobster pot removals in Connecticut and LGBT senior housing.

Federal budget appropriations do not exist to pad the pockets of special interests or to fulfill lawmakers’ local pet projects. To use them in such a way is shameful.

While aid to Ukraine is important and urgent, its addition to an omnibus bill meant to fund the government through the next fiscal year is strange. A more thorough examination of the motivations behind its inclusion reveals an alarming truth.

Policymakers whose tanking approval ratings threaten their job security — thanks to policy fails that have led to rampant inflation, shrinking paychecks, skyrocketing gas prices, and the dream of homeownership becoming further and further out of reach for many hardworking Americans — are capitalizing on an opportunity amid the pressure of a government shutdown and an international catastrophe to pull a fast one on taxpayers and fund their pet projects.

If aid to Ukraine was the most important and urgent item on the legislative docket, the past-due 2022 federal government funding bill should have been passed independently. But instead, even though 62 percent of Americans don’t want to go to war in Ukraine, Congress is using the crisis to distract from a load of earmarks.

Powerbrokers in Washington apparently do not think Americans will notice the egregious spending provisions in this bill. To them, the “Wizard of Oz” approach will leave Americans satisfied, feeling as though the United States helped Ukraine while averting a shutdown. The American people will be left to foot a bill, however, that is much larger than they realize, with $4 billion in needless spending that is virtually meaningless to the average American.

Some of the more egregious earmarks in the bill include Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Deleware requesting $2 million to address renewable energy and reducing inequity to access to solar power. Rep. Colin Allred of Texas requested $1 million for LGBT-friendly affordable senior housing, while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for $765,000 to plan for “the future of Maine’s lobster industry.”

From Oregon, Rep. Kurt Schrader, Sen. Jeff Merkley, and Sen. Ron Wyden requested $100,000 to research “whale entanglement risk reduction,” and Merkley and Wyden sought $800,000 for wildfire smoke research and practice in the state.

An earmark by Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy seeks $569,000 to remove derelict lobster pots in Connecticut. Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey requested $995,000 for “grid resistance and equity in the energy transition.”

This is what the return of earmarks looks like. Congressional leadership is not focused on the issues Americans care about. The reality of funding “normal government operations” is that funding is very questionable and has become a cash grab for elected officials. We need to change that drastically or future generations of Americans will pay severely for our fiscal irresponsibility.

7 Times The Babylon Bee Reported History Before It Happened,"After USA Today named Rachel Levine, the male head of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one of its “Women of the Year,” Twitter suspended popular satire site The Babylon Bee for bestowing a similar award on Levine: Man of the Year.

The Babylon Bee's Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine https://t.co/mZdcXbUnmf — The Babylon Bee (@TheBabylonBee) March 15, 2022

Twitter threatened to keep the account locked until the Bee deletes the satirical tweet, something CEO Seth Dillon has pledged not to do.

We're not deleting anything. Truth is not hate speech. If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, then so be it. — Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) March 20, 2022

While Twitter struts its bully power to shut down free speech and keeps us all from our favorite source of satire accurate predictions of insanity, it’s a good time to reflect on all the times the Bee has proven a more reliable source of news than corporate outlets like The Washington Post and CNN. Here are a few of the most memorable times the Bee’s satirists predicted history before it was written.

1. Biden Briefs TikTokers on Foreign Wars

On August 16, 2021, the Bee wrote the satirical headline: “Biden Administration Deploys Elite Squad Of TikTok Influencers To Stop Taliban.”

As the Bee joked: “‘I’m sorry it has come to this, but I’m left with no other choice,’ said Biden to a chocolate eclair in the Camp David situation room as beloved TikTok star Benny Drama and others parachuted from a C-130 into Kabul. ‘If anyone can influence those Gen Z Taliban youth, it’s those flamboyant youngsters.'”

But truth is stranger than satire, and seven months later after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration actually did call in a TikTok brigade.

“We recognize this is a critically important avenue in the way the American public is finding out about the latest so we wanted to make sure you had the latest information from an authoritative source,” White House director of digital strategy Rob Flaherty said while briefing TikTok stars on the Biden administration’s talking points about Ukraine: specifically, blaming Russia for rising gas prices here in the United States that have been climbing for a year under Biden’s anti-oil policies.

2. Make Your Groceries Stretch Further, You Poors

Just two weeks ago, the Bee took aim at the Biden administration’s tone-deaf suggestions that rising gas prices and inflation create a great opportunity for Americans to cut back on our “dependence on fossil fuels” and buy expensive electric cars. “Biden Admin Suggests Adding More Water To Your Instant Ramen To Feel More Full,” the Bee headlined.

Someone at Bloomberg News’ opinion desk must have been reading the Bee, because three days later Bloomberg published Teresa Ghilarducci’s tone-deaf piece “Inflation Stings Most If You Earn Less Than $300K. Here’s How to Deal.”

While she didn’t mention ramen, Ghilarducci suggested Americans swap out eating meat in favor of lentils and beans. “Though your palate may not be used to it, tasty meat substitutes include vegetables (where prices are up a little over 4%, or lentils and beans, which are up about 9%),” she wrote, alongside recommendations like letting your pet die of cancer and selling your car.

3. Kamala Harris Goes to Hillary Clinton Charm School

After six months of Vice President Kamala Harris snipping at reporters and laughing awkwardly at all the wrong times (plus all of her cringy campaign trail moments), the Bee wrote a July 2021 piece entitled “To Improve Public Perception, Kamala Harris Taking Likability Lessons From Hillary Clinton.”

The Bee’s satirists wrote: “‘First things first Kamala,’ explained Clinton. ‘Next time you’re tempted to cackle uncontrollably, just call half of the U.S. ‘a basket of deplorables’ instead.'”

But in December, it came out that Kamala actually was turning to Hillary for advice on how to be more popular. “Faced with declining approval ratings, a series of staff departures and a drumbeat of criticism from Republicans and the conservative news media, she has turned to powerful confidantes, including Hillary Clinton, to help plot a path forward,” The New York Times reported. “The two speak every few months on the phone; in November, Mrs. Clinton visited Ms. Harris in her West Wing office.”

4. California Lets Men into Women’s Prisons

All the way back in 2017, the Bee wrote the headline “Inclusivity Win: State Of California To Make All Prisons Gender-Neutral.”

“I promise you that felt outlandish in 2017,” the Bee’s Editor in Chief Kyle Mann said in a video last year.

But sure enough, in September 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law to let “transgender, non-binary and intersex” inmates pick which sex to identify with and be housed accordingly. In the first few months after the law went into effect, the state received hundreds of transfer requests, mostly from men hoping to be moved to women’s prisons.

After fears and reports of rape, California’s solution was to pass out condoms to female inmates. Just in January, a leaked memo from Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services indicated the administration’s plans to follow suit in federal prisons as well.

5. People Who Thought 2016 Election Was Rigged Say 2020 Was Foolproof

“Study Finds Connection Between Believing Russia Rigged 2016 Election And Believing 2020 Election Was Foolproof,” the Bee wrote in mid-November 2020. “If you believed that Vladimir Putin somehow hacked voting machines, purchased a bunch of memes, and raised an army of millions of Russian bots to disrupt the election and get Donald Trump elected, you certainly now believe that our elections are completely safe and secure,” the Bee said, citing a pretend researcher.

Just days later, a poll reported that 91 percent of Democrats believed Biden’s election was “free and fair,” compared with 43 percent who said the 2016 election of Donald Trump was trustworthy.

6. Sources Say Trump Attacks Babies

A month before the 2020 presidential election, the Bee published “Anonymous White House Source Claims Trump Punched A Baby,” writing “The media has reached out to the baby, who chooses to remain anonymous. According to media investigators, the baby, in his first words, has anonymously endorsed Biden for president.”

But Mediaite apparently couldn’t take the joke about the insane, baseless attacks that corporate outlets and anonymous “sources” have ginned up about the former president. Four days later, Mediaite’s Tommy Christopher published a video and an accompanying article titled “WATCH: 98 Times Trump Disparaged Babies By Using Them as an Insult” and going to bat for the sensitivities of “infanto-Americans.”

“In the interest of posterity, especially all the babies who are currently too stupid or busy ruining America to understand them right now, we’ve compiled examples, which you can watch above,” he wrote in a piece that wasn’t satire (but should have been).

7. Anything Leftists Disagree with Is Violence (And Will Get You Deplatformed)

Way back in 2018, the Bee joked “Violence Officially Redefined As ‘Literally Anything At All That Makes You Feel The Slightest Discomfort.'” That was before the 2020 summer of rage, of course, when even literal silence was deemed “violence” while scenes of burning cities were described moronically by corporate journalists as “mostly peaceful.”

But Twitter’s own actions against the Bee have helped cement this once-comedic headline into reality. In its message threatening to keep the Bee’s account locked until its satirical-but-actually-factual story about Rachel Levine is taken down, Twitter invoked its rules against “hateful conduct.”

“You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of … gender identity,” the rules note, despite no indication that the Bee’s article did anything remotely resembling violence, threats, or harassment. “We applaud this precious and perfectly made child of God for all his accomplishments and hope he stays true to who God made him to be,” the piece noted.

The joke is on Twitter. Not only is the Big Tech bully showing its ridiculous vendetta and giving the Bee a lot of publicity, it’s also helping the Bee’s prophesies come true.

8 Joe Biden Scandals To Investigate After Admittal Hunter’s Laptop Is Legit,"Last week, The New York Times quietly acknowledged that the emails recovered from the MacBook Hunter Biden abandoned at a Delaware computer store were authentic. The admission came nearly a year-and-a-half late, after the corrupt media — legacy and social — buried the scandal the New York Post broke just weeks before the November election.

Merely admitting the laptop is legitimate is not enough. Rather, by concurring in the authenticity of the laptop and the emails, the supposed standard-bearers of journalism have also implicitly acknowledged the validity of the scandals spawn by the porn-filled MacBook. And notwithstanding the salacious source of the documentary evidence of the scandals, the scandals are not about Hunter Biden: They are about now-President Biden.

Here are the eight Joe Biden scandals deserving further coverage.

1. Pay-to-Play in Ukraine

The most obvious scandal bared by the emails and text messages contained on Hunter’s laptop concerns the influence profiteering Joe Biden apparently participated in during his eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president, with Ukraine featuring heavily in the pay-to-play scheme.

The New York Times, in its likely “get ahead of the story,” coverage from last week, touched on the Ukrainian angle by noting Hunter’s connection to Burisma and then quoting emails recovered from the laptop indicating the younger Biden leveraged his dad’s position — then as vice president. But the Times’ surface coverage of the Burisma scandal doesn’t nearly suffice.

Surface it was: The Times made no mention of Hunter’s appointment to Burisma Holdings Board of Directors at a reported salary of $50,000 per month during his dad’s time as vice president. Hunter Biden had no experience in energy. So, a deep-dive on the entire Biden-Burisma connection is a first step.

2. China Gets in the Game

Ukraine is but a patch on the influence-peddling undertaken by Hunter on behalf of “the big guy,” as the younger Biden referred to his dad. China also played a large role in the family enterprise, as demonstrated by, again, passing coverage in November 2021. Then, the Times reported, in brief, that Hunter Biden’s joint global equity firm, the Bohai Harvest Equity Investment Fund, had helped coordinate the purchase by a Chinese mining company of the world’s largest cobalt source in the Congo.

That deal gave China control over a huge chunk of the world’s known cobalt supplies — an ingredient necessary to make electric car batteries. And the role of Hunter Biden’s company, Bohai, in the transaction again connects directly to Joe Biden, as Hunter reportedly launched that new joint enterprise with Chinese business partners less than two weeks after he traveled to China on Air Force Two with his then-vice president father.

In exploring this scandal, the press needs to push beyond the emails recovered from Hunter’s abandoned laptop, and do what Tucker Carlson did when the pay-to-play scandal first surfaced: talk to Hunter’s former business partner Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski provides further proof that this scandal reaches the top of the Biden family.

3. Moscow, Kazakhstan, and More

While Ukraine and China likely hold the most significant revelations, once those threads are pulled, investigators should move on to Moscow, which according to a Senate report, holds another possible scandal. That report documents that Hunter also received a combined $3.5 million from the wife of the former Moscow mayor, a Kazakhstan investor, and several other individuals. After all, there is no reason to think that a person willing to let his son sell access to the vice president of the United States would close the money train to just a few countries.

4. Ukraine’s Firing of the Prosecutor Investigating Burisma

With the elite media now deigning coverage of Hunter’s laptop appropriate, the public knows the Burisma scandal was real and threatened to be spectacularly devastating to the elder Biden. That makes questions concerning then-Vice President Joe Biden’s demands that Ukraine fire the state prosecutor who was reportedly investigating Burisma ripe to revisit.

That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired, according to statements Joe Biden made during a 2018 event, after Biden threatened to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to ax Shokin. A video of the event captured Biden recounting the event:

I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours.’ If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.

While the Obama administration attempted to spin Biden’s push for the firing of Shokin, by claiming the international community had demanded Ukraine terminate the state prosecutor, a State Department official contradicted that claim during congressional testimony. George Kent, who worked on issues related to Ukraine at the State Department, reportedly told lawmakers it was the Obama administration that “spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine.”

Biden needs to answer questions anew over his threats to withhold money from Ukraine unless the country removed the state prosecutor responsible for investigating Burisma. Democrats have impeached a president for less.

5. Obama-Biden Administration Ignoring Conflicts of Interest

Biden also needs to answer questions about his decision to ignore the clear conflicts of interest involved with him negotiating with the same countries Hunter was shaking down. Of course, since “the big guy” was in on the scam, bowing out over conflicts of interest is the lesser of the evils, but it is still worth investigating to assess how Biden handled the concerns raised by the Obama administration’s State Department.

Here, the testimony of the State Department official charged with issues related to Ukraine again proves significant. Kent told lawmakers that after learning Hunter sat on the board of Burisma, he raised concerns with the vice president’s office about the relationship.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent testified before House members in October of 2019. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time … That was the end of that conversation.”

The question for now-President Biden, then, is whether anyone in his office raised concerns about the clear conflicts-of-interest with him personally, and if so, why did Biden ignore the problem?

6. The Intelligence Community’s Briefing of Biden

Another scandal reaching President Biden concerns his interactions with the intelligence community after the FBI, and presumably the CIA and other such agencies, learned in December of 2019, that Hunter Biden believed Russians had stolen Hunter’s laptop, rendering the Bidens susceptible to blackmail.

Here, it is important to understand that there are two separate Hunter Biden laptops at issue. The most-discussed laptop was actually the second laptop. That laptop was the one Hunter had abandoned at the Delaware repair shop. Then, after the repair shop owner discovered concerning material on the MacBook, the store owner handed it to the FBI in December of 2019. The owner of the repair shop, however, had first made a copy of the hard drive, which resulted in The New York Post’s coverage in October 2020.

But there was another laptop — one Hunter believed Russians had stolen from him when he was binging on drugs with prostitutes in the summer of 2018 in Las Vegas. While the public did not learn about the existence of this earlier laptop until August of 2021, the FBI knew about it as early as December 2019, when they took possession of the second laptop Hunter had left at the repair store.

Among other material contained on the second laptop was a video of Biden recounting the circumstances of his first laptop disappearing with some Russians. Significantly, on that video Hunter Biden said his first laptop contained a ton of material leaving him susceptible to blackmail, since his father was “running for president” and Hunter talked “about it all the time.”

It is inconceivable that the FBI and the intelligence communities did not brief Biden on this discovery and the risk of blackmail, given that former FBI Director James Comey briefed Trump on the fake Steele dossier. On second thought, that is the initial question reporters should ask the president: “Did the FBI brief you, Mr. President, on the fact that Hunter believed Russians had stolen a laptop containing compromising information?”

From there, an inquiring press should investigate to ensure that Joe Biden did not direct the intelligence community to bury this national security risk to protect himself or his son.

7. Possible Collusion to Interfere in the 2020 Election

An honest press should also investigate whether now-President Biden or anyone connected to his then-presidential campaign pressured reporters, media outlets, or companies such as Twitter and Facebook to censor the Hunter Biden story. And what about the “fifty former intelligence officials” who publicly declared the laptop resembled a Russian disinformation campaign—something clearly untrue? Did Biden or his campaign coordinate with those individuals, several of whom had endorsed the Democratic candidate, in the release of the letter?

Given that polls show that 17 percent of Joe Biden voters would not have voted for him in 2020, if they had known about the Biden family scandals, the collective burying of the laptop scandal represents the most significant interference in elections ever seen in our country. So, “Did Biden or his campaign have anything to do with the decision to kill the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter’s MacBook?” And “What about the ‘fifty former intelligence officials?’”

From there the follow-ups flow quickly: “Who was involved in the push to silence the story and who were the executives or ‘journalists’ who bowed to the demands?” “Who coordinated with the intelligence officials?” “Were any threats or promises made?” “What were they?” “What did Joe Biden know?” “What about other Democrats and the Democratic National Committee?”

8. Joe Biden Is a ‘Lying Dog-Faced Pony Soldier’

The final Joe Biden scandal the press should push President Biden to answer concerns his lies to the American public. While there are too many to count, two merit further questioning.

First, the media should demand Biden answer for lying to the country when he seethed, “I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period.” The evidence overwhelmingly shows that Biden not only knew of the family business deals but was part of them.

The second bold-faced fabrication from Biden came during his pre-election debate with Trump, when Trump raised “the laptop from hell.” When Trump asked Biden if he was saying the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” the then-Democratic candidate replied, “That’s exactly what [I] was told.”

Unlikely. Biden also countered with this doozy, which again raises the question of whether Biden had a role in the intelligence officials’ statement:

There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.

We can now add The New York Times to Giuliani. It remains to be seen, though, whether the Old Grey Lady and the other legacy outlets will report on the further scandals the laptop revealed—the ones that reach the president of the United States.

Ukraine's War Highlights Again That Men And Women Are Different,"Image Credit PxHere

A question asked in a recent Quinnipiac University poll sparked a national conversation: “If you were in the same position as Ukrainians are now, do you think that you would stay and fight or leave the country?”

Some commentators expressed alarm that only 53 percent of poll respondents said they would “stay and fight,” while 38 percent would “leave the country.” A partisan divide also drew notice.

More Republicans and Independents said they would stay and fight (68 and 57 percent, respectively), compared to 40 percent of Democrats. Twenty-five and 36 percent of Republicans and Independents would leave the country, compared to 52 percent of Democrats.

These responses reflect poorly on Democrats, but even more significant findings appear in the survey’s internals, which reveal striking differences between gender and age groups.

Gender Gap

A healthy 70 percent of male respondents said they would stay and fight, and only 24 percent said they would leave the country. Among women, 40 percent would stay, and 52 percent said they would leave.

These findings do not discredit women. They are signs of a civilized culture and values that we are seeing right now in Ukraine. Amid the violence of war, under official orders, thousands of manly men have taken up arms and, with broken hearts, sent their wives and children away, hoping for reunification when the fight is over.

These painful family separations are happening without public controversy. When was the last time we saw an entire nation of men showing respect for women and children in this way?

The women of Ukraine also are showing remarkable heroism. Fleeing bombed-out cities in desperate journeys seeking refuge, under the worst conditions imaginable, they are shouldering the burden of saving their children and sometimes parents.

Womanly women are making Molotov cocktails and talking to international media from bomb shelters. Some have joined the military to fight or to care for wounded troops and civilian casualties, doing so with courage rivaling that of the men.

Even elderly people have confronted Russian soldiers and found ways to slow or destroy Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tanks. Women have always stepped up to serve in times of national emergency, but not necessarily in ways identical to men.

Complementary But Different Strengths

Doctrinaire egalitarians do not understand or appreciate complementary differences between men and women. They keep demanding percentage-based female quotas to achieve “diversity” in the combat arms, failing to appreciate the womanliness of nurturing children.

Civilization would not be strengthened if women were expected to fight in numbers equal to men, leaving vulnerable children, like the Ukrainian girl in the center of this Associated Press photograph, to fend for themselves. Like the Afghan girl on the cover of National Geographic, her expression speaks for all the children — bewildered, frightened, and needing protection in the midst of chaos.

A generational divide in the Quinnipiac poll also requires analysis. Sixty-six percent of older respondents (50-64 years old) said they would “stay and fight,” but only 45 percent of younger respondents (18-34 years old) said they would. The trendline is concerning because of its implications for national security.

In the civilian world as well as the military, it is easy to understand why younger men might be less likely to defend America. Columnist Kathleen Parker has noted a growing intolerance toward “boy behavior” in general. School reading lists have replaced books about male knights and heroes with aggressive “girl power” books and movies that leave the boys out.

Neutralizing Maleness

In an interview, feminist Camille Paglia deplored gender politics being taught in universities. In a “very anti-male way,” she said, “it’s all about neutralization of maleness.” In 2019, the American Psychological Association defined “traditional masculinity,” meaning “stoicism, competitiveness, dominance, and aggression,” as “harmful” and conducive to unhealthy “behaviors.”

For years, pervasive Pajama Boy images have eroded manliness. Even at the U.S. Military Academy in 2020, a discussion program about “toxic masculinity” led one cadet to comment, “I’m being taught how not to be a man.”

At the same time, Colin Kaepernick kneeling demonstrations, combined with critical race theory (CRT) and 1619 Project instructions that distort history, have weakened patriotism. CRT ideology maintains that all institutions, including our Constitution, sprang from “white supremacy” and “systemic racism.”

No wonder some young people believe that America is not worthy of defense. The survey shows that increasing numbers would rather leave than fight.

Our history is not perfect; neither is Ukraine’s. But the valor and patriotism we are seeing there have earned the admiration of the world.

Zelensky’s Manly Leadership

Ukrainians are led by a manly leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, who channeled Winston Churchill while addressing the British Parliament in a green T-shirt and received a standing ovation. It is difficult to imagine anyone else in the world or history who could have done that with credibility.

Zelensky will not get everything he wants, but his public projection of courage is contagious. The men of Ukraine will continue to fight, and the women will do whatever it takes to ensure their families’ survival.

The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, on which I served, discussed cultural values in the military. Would assignments for women in combat (infantry) units be a step forward for civilization or a step backward?

Fellow commissioner Kate O’Beirne summarized the majority position succinctly: “Good men protect and defend women.” Now, in real time, we are seeing real men putting their lives on the line to protect and defend women, children, and the nation they love.

Putin epitomizes a society that does not protect and defend women. Putin’s deliberate bombings of a maternity hospital, a theater, and an art school sheltering vulnerable civilians in Mariupol were cruel attacks on women, children, and civilization itself.

It is good to know that 70 percent of men would stay and fight if America were under attack, but the lower inclination of younger men to do so is a matter of concern. For the sake of national security, society must reinforce respect for manly men and womanly women, on which our civilized culture depends.

The U.S. Should Have No Part In Fomenting A War Of Attrition In Ukraine,"The Russo-Ukrainian war, now in its fourth week, seems to be entering a new phase. The Russian advance on Kyiv has stalled, with Russian forces outside the city essentially in the same place they were a week ago. A grinding war of attrition is beginning to emerge.

Earlier this week, the Ukrainians reportedly recaptured a town called Makariv, about 40 miles from Kyiv, that has traded hands between Russian and Ukrainian troops several times now. In the south, the Ukrainians are said to be preparing a counteroffensive in hopes of reclaiming Russian-occupied territory.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the rubble of Mariupol, where food and water are running out. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the city is being “reduced to ashes,” and from the looks of it, he is not exaggerating.

What does the transformation of the conflict into a war of attrition mean for the West? Contrary to the predictions of some prominent interventionists, it almost certainly does not mean the Russians are on the cusp of defeat. It does not mean that regime change in Moscow, which Bing West advocated for this week in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, is on the horizon.

It does not mean that Sen. Lindsay Graham’s repeated calls for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin are about to be heeded. It also does not mean that Russia is as isolated and cut off from the rest of the world as the Biden White House and the corporate press would have us believe.

A war of attrition in Ukraine likely means a longer, drawn-out conflict in which Russia continues to bombard urban centers, killing civilians and swelling the ranks of war refugees that already number some 3.5 million. Such a conflict would entail not just the complete destruction of Mariupol but of vast swathes of Ukraine.

Contrary to what Biden administration officials have been suggesting to the press, and despite high casualties and loss of equipment, Russia is not going to run out of soldiers and war materiel anytime soon. A bloody war of attrition could drag on for months, which would mean the worst is yet to come for the Ukrainian people.

American leaders need to reassess what role the United States should play in this new phase of the war — not what role the neoconservative consensus in Washington wants the United States and its European allies to play, but what would best serve American interests. That is, what would bring about an end to the war and a political settlement that gives Russia as little as possible and creates a lasting peace in the region.

Sadly, the Biden administration does not even seem to be thinking along these lines. Instead, the White House is entertaining the dangerous fantasy that a prolonged war of attrition, or a western-backed insurgency inside Ukraine, would be preferable to a negotiated political settlement.

Earlier this month the Washington Post reported the United States and our European allies “are planning how to help establish and support a government-in-exile, which could direct guerrilla operations against Russian occupiers.” Over the weekend, the New York Times reported the Biden administration “seeks to help Ukraine lock Russia in a quagmire.” Indeed, the sheer volume of weapons and military equipment the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies are now sending into Ukraine might well sustain such a quagmire long after the conventional war grinds to a halt.

President Biden has to date said practically nothing about negotiations, and there is no indication the United States is engaged in a serious diplomatic effort to broker a settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, we are hearing about Biden’s plan to get U.S. allies on board for a new round of economic sanctions against Russia, as if sanctions will somehow change the reality on the battlefield (it will not, at least not in the near term, especially if the European Union continues to buy oil and gas from Russia).

The White House’s strategy, such as it is, seems to be to keep the war going by whatever means possible in hopes of bringing about a humiliating defeat of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the total withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine — a goal that Secretary of State Anthony Blinken explicitly laid out a few weeks ago — while somehow not escalating to the point that the United States and NATO are pulled into the war. How the Biden administration hopes to achieve that with a growing chorus of voices in Washington calling on Biden to do more, including the provision of more advanced weaponry, is unclear.

Setting aside the callousness of this strategy, which would mean tens of thousands of civilian casualties and the displacement of millions more war refugees, the assumptions underlying it are straightforward: as the war drags on it will weaken Putin, morale will plummet among Russian troops, anti-war sentiment inside Russia will destabilize the Kremlin, Ukrainian forces will continue to be effective and perhaps even recapture territory and cities. Ukraine might even win, just as the anti-Soviet Afghan mujahedeen won in the 1980s backed by U.S. arms and expertise. Putin might be assassinated or removed from office in a coup d’état, ushering in a truly democratic and peaceful regime in Moscow.

Heady stuff, but not very realistic. The reality of a war of attrition in Ukraine is that Russian forces will lay siege to Ukraine’s cities, bombarding them from afar. For an idea of what that will entail, of the terrible cost in human lives and suffering, look no further than Mariupol. How long could Kyiv withstand such a siege? Weeks, not months.

It is also not at all clear that a slow, grinding war will necessarily be to Russia’s disadvantage. Moscow has gambled everything on this war, so U.S. leaders should assume that almost nothing is off the table. As Michael Kofman noted on a recent War on the Rocks podcast, military forces from elsewhere in Russia could be brought into the fight to make up for casualties and equipment losses in Ukraine.

In addition, advanced weapons, like the hypersonic missiles Russia claims to have used on Friday and Saturday to take out munitions and fuel depots in western and southern Ukraine, could also be introduced. (If true, these missile strikes mark the first time hypersonic weapons of this kind have ever been used in war.) And of course, hanging over the entire conflict, and understandably constraining the West, is the specter of nuclear weapons.

If Russia is able to make gradual gains in the south and east, as seems likely, then Moscow’s stated demands — that Ukraine recognize the independence of Donetsk and Lugansk, accept Russian sovereignty over Crimea, and enshrine neutrality in its constitution — will harden and perhaps expand, making it much harder for the West to broker a settlement that forces Moscow to compromise. Likewise, Russian battlefield gains will increase the likelihood that Russia will insist on an easing of western sanctions as a condition of ending the war.

In other words, by prolonging the war, the United States and NATO would be strengthening Moscow’s position, not weakening it.

All of this is of course speculation. But based on what we know and what we have seen thus far in Ukraine, it seems reasonable to conclude that a protracted war of attrition is not in the American national interest, and that a U.S. strategy that enables and encourages such a war, in addition to the indifference it shows for the suffering of the Ukrainian people, is misbegotten in the extreme.

Why Does Ukraine Get More From U.S. Elites Than Their Own Nation?,"We are now in the second week of around-the-clock obsession by U.S. media and political leaders about Ukraine. The rhetoric has grown increasingly alarming, and the media reports are increasingly detached from reality.

About a week ago, a story spread like wildfire, boosted by some in the Biden administration and in Europe: Russia had attacked nuclear reactors, the reactors had caught fire, and the resulting meltdown could be far worse than the famous Chernobyl power plant disaster. This, it turned out, was a preposterous lie on multiple fronts, especially the threats of a Chernobyl-style meltdown. Yet U.S. media gobbled it up, and politicians gleefully used it as an excuse to further escalate an already tense situation.

I’ve come under some fire for asking the simple question about Ukraine: why is this in our interest? Why do we care so much about a foreign conflict 6,000 miles away while our own country suffers from a number of high-profile problems?

To put it in context, 200,000 Russians invaded Ukraine, give or take. That same number illegally pours across our southern border every month. While the Russians brought tanks and other deadly weaponry, the crisis at our border has brought plenty of its own misery: fentanyl, sex trafficking, and gang violence that has driven the murder rate in American cities through the roof.

The war in Ukraine has given Joe Biden political cover, taking focus away from inflation and his border policies, and too many Republicans have gone along. Biden has been able to go on TV, act tough, and pretend to be presidential, ignoring that his weakness and policies are key reasons Russia invaded Ukraine in the first place.

Amid the imagery of horrific war and carnage in Ukraine, Biden’s open borders have unleashed significant carnage in our own country that has received far less media coverage. America has a border crisis, to be sure, and it’s not some shifting demarcation 6,000 miles away, it’s our very own southern border.

Already in Biden’s first year in office, Customs and Border Patrol reports an astounding 1.9 million illegal migrants encountered or arrested. For January 2022, 153,941 illegal migrants were intercepted crossing our border, the vast majority of them working-aged men. Comparatively, in January 2020, pre-Covid, under President Donald Trump the total crossing number was 36,585.

What explains this nearly four-fold increase? Incentives matter, and Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the alleged “border czar,” promise generous benefits and even the promise of eventual citizenship to anyone who can get here to trespass into our homeland. American citizens be damned.

The illegal and unfair labor market competition from these economic migrants depresses pay while Biden’s inflation surge crushes real wages. Meanwhile, the lawless American border we now tolerate also facilitates a massive and regular flow of illegal drugs into America, including opioids and fentanyl, which poison many heartland communities and bring heartbreaking tragedy to emergency rooms and funeral homes nationwide.

Ohio has been especially hard hit. Per Centers for Disease Control data, my state ranks as the third-worst in America for per-capita overdose deaths. Nationwide, America hit a grim milestone in 2021, with more than 100,000 overdose deaths total. As I referenced in my Conservative Political Action Conference speech, I personally know the terrible toll illegal drugs take on American families, as my own mother suffered from addiction for years.

This fentanyl flows largely from Mexico. It often originates in China, but the cartels know the easiest and fastest way to smuggle anything illegal into America—whether a trafficked child or narcotics—is our porous and lawless southern border, thanks to the American left. According to New York Post reporting, “U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported a 1,066% increase in fentanyl seized at eight Southern Texas ports during Fiscal Year 2021.”

We rightfully empathize with innocent people caught in the crossfire in Ukraine and pray for peace, as Christians are obligated to do, but we should also ask: why does that crisis get more attention than one’s closer to home? Where’s the media empathy and compassion for the tens of thousands of Americans killed by fentanyl brought across our southern border? Or for the explosive sex trafficking increase in our own communities? Or for the inflationary crisis that has made many of our citizens unable to live prosperous lives?

Indeed, how we react as individuals to Ukraine is separate from how we ought to respond as a nation. Every argument offered for why we should care—Ukrainians are defensive, Russians aggressive; Ukraine is a democracy; Russia is not; Ukraine is liberal; Russia authoritarian—could apply to any number of conflicts over the last 20 years. Yet none of them have enjoyed the obsessive, bipartisan focus of American elites.

Some observers, including a number of my opponents in the Ohio Senate race, have suggested that we ought to focus on both. But if it’s so easy to focus on Ukraine’s border while fixing our own, why don’t we?

The simple answer is that Ukraine has given Joe Biden a political get out of jail free card. He can blame Russia for high gas prices when the truth is, it’s his own energy policies that have made us dependent on Russia. He can blame the conflict for driving inflation through the roof even though his own policies have done that for more than a year.

Republicans should demand passage of an America First border protection plan, which would provide $4 of funding for border wall completion for every $1 of aid we send to Ukraine. Predicate aid to Ukraine on solving America’s problems, and force Democrats (and many Republicans) to vote on whether they care for their own country.

It’s insulting to our own citizens, and strategically stupid, to devote billions of resources to Ukraine while ignoring the problems in our own country. Let’s stop doing it, and force the American leadership to answer the question of who they actually care about.

The Most Humane Goal For Ukraine Is The Quickest Settlement Possible,"As the war in Ukraine grinds on, there are mildly encouraging signs of a negotiated settlement. Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly has outlined to his Turkish counterpart Recep Erdogan a set of terms that might provide the starting point for a compromise peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s statement that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also opens the door to an agreement.

Nonetheless, the risks of a longer, larger war in which NATO forces confront Russian ones remain alarmingly high. The humanitarian consequences of a wider and more protracted conflict would be devastating — not only for the Ukrainian people, the Russian people, and the people of the West, but especially for the global poor. In their interest, a negotiated settlement is imperative.

But the attitude of the Biden administration to the promising signs of a settlement is unclear. It may well be that the Biden administration wants to decapitate Putin and force regime change on Russia.

The War Party inside the United States is still loudly beating its drums. Some Western analysts do not find the risk of nuclear war at all daunting. Only about 35 percent of the American public says it favors military action to help Ukraine even at the risk of a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine.

Purpose of Sanctions

U.S. sanctions, originally intended to forestall a Russian invasion and then to stop its advance, failed miserably in those objectives. If they serve any purpose now other than vindictiveness, that purpose seems to be to crash the Russian economy, inflict the maximum hardship on the Russian people, and provoke either a popular uprising against Putin, a military takeover, or a successful assassination of Russia’s leader.

What is expected to happen after regime change is anybody’s guess. A Russian version of North Korea, perhaps? A Russia that will become the satellite of China — China’s very own Belarus?

But because even extreme and unprecedented sanctions take time to produce their effects, the Biden administration appears to want to buy that time by encouraging the Ukrainians to fight to the bitter end — although without exposing NATO forces to the dangers of combat. Remember that during the war in Kosovo, NATO pilots were instructed to fire on their targets from altitudes that put them beyond the reach of Serb anti-aircraft fire, but that endangered civilians below. Some lives matter; others apparently not as much.

If this is the U.S. strategy, it may work — but at what cost?

The calls in the West for enlarging and prolonging the conflict seem on the surface to be motivated by humanitarian concerns. No one can look at the suffering of innocent Ukrainian people on the nightly news and not be moved by compassion. But humanitarianism requires peace, even a bad peace, rather than a longer and larger war.

Famine in the World’s Poorest Nations

The head of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization recently painted a frightening picture of the effects of the Russian-Ukraine conflict on global food supplies.

Consider wheat. Wheat is a staple food for more than 35 percent of the world’s population. Fifty countries depend on Russia and Ukraine for 30 percent or more of their wheat supply. Many of those countries are low-income, food deficit countries in North Africa, Asia, or the Middle East.

Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iran buy more than 60 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Lebanon, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, and Pakistan also rely heavily on those two countries for their wheat supply. A continuation of the conflict could severely disrupt agricultural production in both Ukraine and Russia.

Ukraine’s cereal crops would normally be ready for harvesting this June, but it is unclear whether Ukrainian farmers will be able to harvest and deliver them. If ports on the Black Sea are closed, the situation will be even worse.

In other words, mass starvation looms in many of the poorest and most vulnerable nations of the world if the conflict continues or intensifies. There is thus a humanitarian imperative to end it swiftly. If the war becomes a test of wills between Russia and NATO, the poor of Egypt and Bangladesh will be its silent victims.

U.S. Security Interest in Preventing Famine

It is not “appeasement” of Putin to try to find a negotiated way out of the war. It is elementary humaneness. But it is also hard-headed realism.

A famine in Egypt could destabilize the government of that major American ally and throw the Middle East into utter confusion. Acute food shortages in India could drive that great Asian democracy (and potential counterweight to China) away from the United States and closer to Russia and China. It is illusory to believe that U.S. actions have isolated Russia and left it an international pariah.

Even apart from humanitarianism, then, a sober calculation of America’s vital security interests requires consideration of the second- and third-order effects of our current strategy. Admiration for the courage of the Ukrainian resistance, indignation at Russian aggression, or compassion for its people should not blind us to the disasters, both humanitarian and strategic, that will result if the war does not end soon.

"To America’s Virtue Signaling Elite, Ukraine Is The New ‘Black Lives Matter’","Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began several weeks ago, America’s ruling elites have wasted no time in letting you know how much they so deeply care about the conflict.

Embark on a journey to your favorite social media network or news outlet, and you’ll find some of the country’s biggest corporations, media figures, and celebrities wrapping themselves in the blue and gold of Ukraine’s flag. While companies like Google and Skype employ their ubiquitous presence to encourage users to support relief efforts in Ukraine, American politicians have taken virtue signaling to a whole new level.

Skype is allowing its users to make free calls to Ukraine

As a callback to the viral clip of Ukrainian soldiers telling a Russian warship to “go f-ck yourself,” for instance, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse has not only etched the infamous statement in his Twitter bio, but has written it in Russian. Since the outset of the invasion, the Republican senator’s personal Twitter feed has been filled with tweets and retweets pertaining to the conflict, including a reposting of a tweet falsely claiming that the Ukrainians who told off the Russian warship “held their ground” and “were killed.”

Screenshot of a Google ad encouraging users to support Ukraine relief efforts

Democrats have also been just as unbearable in flaunting their self-righteousness on the issue, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reading a poem written by U2 frontman Bono on St. Patrick’s Day last week that pays tribute to Ukraine and the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Oh St. Patrick, he drove out the snakes with his prayers, but that’s not all it takes. With the smoke symbolizes an evil that arises and hides in your heart as it breaks,” Pelosi said. “And the evil risen from the darkness that lives in some men, but in sorrow and fear, that’s when saints can appear. You drive out those old snakes once again, and they struggle for us to be free from the psycho in this human family. Ireland’s sorrow and pain is now the Ukraine and St. Patrick’s name is now Zelensky.”

The bizarre moment quickly prompted comical reactions from major conservative figures, including a tweet from Federalist publisher Ben Domenech that questioned whether the performance was “a prank.”

“Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this?” Domenech asked.

Is this a prank? Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this? — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) March 17, 2022

While not uncommon for America’s elite to attach themselves to the latest cause that pops up on their Twitter feed, the overwhelming and collective rush to voice support for Ukraine is unlike anything the country has witnessed since the death of George Floyd in May 2020.

Within days of Floyd’s death, Black Lives Matter (BLM) became a universally recognized group and phrase, with nearly every major well-known business and public figure announcing their commitment to the Marxist group’s mission. Companies like Nike were quick to pledge their financial support to BLM’s cause, which included $40 million directed towards “organizations that put social justice, education and addressing racial inequality in America at the center of their work.”

Major entertainment platforms also joined in on the frenzy, with Netflix tweeting that “To be silent is to be complicit. Black lives matter” and Hulu proclaiming they “support Black lives.”

“Today, and every day. You are seen. You are heard. And we are with you,” Hulu’s official Twitter account tweeted.

Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris decided to take her support for the BLM movement a step further, saying that “All Black Lives Matter—that includes Black trans women.”

Ukraine Has Become Black Lives Matter 2.0

While it’s one thing to genuinely care about the plights of Ukrainians suffering from a Russian military onslaught, it’s another to utilize the ongoing invasion to project one’s own moral superiority. Americans need to realize that for elitists like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who previously marched with Black Lives Matter and now seemingly worried more about Ukraine’s borders than America’s, the conflict in Ukraine doesn’t represent a tragedy, but an opportunity for self-aggrandizement.

Much like publicly backing Black Lives Matter, repeatedly pronouncing support for Ukraine has become the latest form of virtue signaling that permits America’s ruling class to place themselves on a moral pedestal and demonstrate to the country how “tolerant” and “accepting” they are, without doing anything actually useful to their neighbors. Whether it’s posting a black square on their Instagram or slapping a Ukrainian flag emoji in their Twitter bio, the goal is always the same: to elevate their own social status.

Moreover, as part of their attempt to exemplify how truly committed they are to the cause, these same individuals will vilify anyone who dares question their narrative. Oppose Black Lives Matter? You’re a racist. Prioritize your own country’s needs above Ukraine’s? You’re a puppet of Putin. Whatever the subject, the tactics never change.

And just as America’s elites ignored the increase in black Americans killed in homicides after the BLM riots and defunding of police in major American cities, expect them to ignore the suffering endured by millions of Ukrainians after the fighting in their country has ceased. While those displaced by the war are left to pick up the remains of their fractured lives, America’s elites will move on with theirs, all the while patting themselves on the back for either doing nothing or making the situation worse.

"Opposing WWIII Doesn't Make You Pro-Putin, It Just Means You're Sane","While Florida Democrats have been running around the Sunshine State yelling “gay!” the rest of the Democrat Party has been busy yelling “Russia!” in the general direction of anything they don’t like. The 2016 election of Donald Trump? Must have been Russia! Hunter Biden’s damning laptop? Russia!

Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine in an attack that’s killed or displaced thousands of civilian innocents, Democrats are even more eager to accuse anyone they dislike of being a Russian plant. So that’s what they’ve resorted to instead of thoughtfully engaging arguments for why going to war with a nuclear power might not be the brightest idea.

It’s an obvious statement that shouldn’t need saying, but the willful distortion of common sense by manipulative media means not enough people are hearing it: Wanting to avoid World War III doesn’t mean you’re a Putin-lover, it just means you’re sane.

Sane people with any knowledge of world affairs aren’t saying that Putin is a great guy, that bombing civilians is totally fine, or that we should all go cheer the red army.

What they are saying is that communist China currently presents a far greater threat to American dominance on the global scale than Russia does and that tying ourselves up in a prolonged conflict in Europe is a bad idea that gives China free reign.

They’re saying that war is a somber thing, not to be entered into lightly or upon the emotional urgings of video game clips and old photos that turn out to be fake.

They’re saying that negotiations are a good thing for Ukraine and that trying to drag out the war (and thus a Russian siege on Ukrainian cities) is likely to cause more devastation while making Russia stronger and Ukraine weaker.

They’re saying that a no-fly zone is going to mean shooting down Russian planes, having the Russians shoot back, and likely finding ourselves in a full-scale war.

They’re saying that perhaps we should pause and consider the potentially devastating consequences if we do let ourselves get pulled into a NATO-Russia war.

They’re saying that the United States is in a power competition with China and that we shouldn’t rush to send Russia over to China’s side to tip the balance; we should remember that the Soviet Union, unpleasant bedfellow as it was, was an arguably necessary ally to defeating Hitler’s Nazi regime in World War II, and we would be unwise to send such a potential scale-tipping country into the arms of a more threatening enemy.

They’re saying that, commendable as the courage of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is, Americans should think twice before mindlessly applauding his efforts to drag us into a world war.

These are all thoughtful concerns held by people who want to see American strength and American lives stewarded carefully and wisely. But instead of acknowledging those concerns or responding to their merits, the leftist media and their neoconservative allies prefer to accuse those who question the warmongering narrative of being Putin puppets.

“Russia and Far-Right Americans Find Common Ground With Ukraine War,” headlined a New York Times piece on Wednesday.

A February op-ed in the Times was even blunter: “How the American Right Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Russia.”

Meanwhile, “The View’s” Ana Navarro suggested the U.S. Department of Justice should investigate Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for challenging the media groupthink.

It’s maliciously dishonest for the corporate media to characterize the right’s hesitation to tear guns-blazing into Ukraine as Putin worship — or to elevate and lend credence to the few fringe crackpots who actually are praising the Russian dictator, while pretending rational critics of war with Russia don’t exist.

A conglomerate of American institutions wants you to believe the only two camps of this fight are those working to drag the United States into another foreign war and those who love the Kremlin. As always, you should be asking yourself why.

Hunter Biden’s Laptops Are Now An Active National Security Threat,"On Friday, The Daily Mail reported that emails recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop show he helped an infectious disease research company pursue projects in Ukraine. Those emails confirm portions of charges Russia made the previous day that an investment group run by the now-president’s son had funded a company conducting research at biological laboratories in Ukraine.

While these developments add another scandal to the long list of Biden family dirty laundry, the more urgent concern for the country should be the continuing threat to our national security posed by a compromised President Biden and the possibility that Russia has access to the catalog of compromising material contained on Hunter’s laptop.

Mere weeks before then-President Donald Trump and Joe Biden faced off in the November 2020 presidential election, The New York Post published emails obtained from a laptop Hunter Biden had abandoned at a repair shop in Delaware. Those emails revealed that during the elder Biden’s time as Barack Obama’s vice president, Hunter engaged in a pay-to-play scandal, trading off his father’s position to strike deals with players in Ukraine and China. The venture was a family one, with Joe “the Big Guy” Biden listed in one email as set to receive a 10 percent cut of one pending deal and Hunter telling his daughter in another message that “pop” took half of his earnings.

Even after a former business partner of Hunter Biden’s confirmed the authenticity of the emails, the supposed standard-bearers of journalism buried the scandal and social media outlets censored both the story and The New York Post. Worse still, “more than 50 former senior intelligence officials” signed a letter framing the Hunter Biden emails as Russian disinformation.

Among others, former CIA directors or acting directors John Brennan, Leon Panetta, Gen. Michael Hayden, John McLaughlin, and Michael Morell signed the letter. In doing so they gave then-candidate Joe Biden cover to lie to the American public, which he did when Trump confronted him about the scandal during a presidential debate.

Are you saying the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Trump asked Biden.

“That’s exactly what [I] was told,” Biden countered. “There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant,” Biden professed to the American public before they went to the polls and elected Biden our commander in chief.

But even The New York Times has finally admitted the laptop was real and the emails were legitimate. Initially, that admission proved significant because it likewise legitimizes the scandals spawned from the documents recovered from Hunter’s abandoned laptop. However, the trajectory of the scandal changed Friday with The Daily Mail’s exclusive.

“Emails from Hunter’s abandoned laptop show he helped secure millions of dollars of funding for Metabiota, a Department of Defense contractor specializing in research on pandemic-causing diseases that could be used as bioweapons,” The Daily Mail announced last week. The article continued: “[Biden] also introduced Metabiota to an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, for a ‘science project’ involving high biosecurity level labs in Ukraine. And although Metabiota is ostensibly a medical data company, its vice president emailed Hunter in 2014 describing how they could ‘assert Ukraine’s cultural and economic independence from Russia’– an unusual goal for a biotech firm.”

The Daily Mail added more details about Metabiota and Hunter Biden’s role in brokering relationships for the research company in Ukraine. Included throughout the article were copies of the emails ostensibly obtained from Hunter’s laptop that confirmed The Daily Mail’s reporting. The article also added details shedding light on Hunter’s “business” dealings in Ukraine during the time his father served as vice president and America’s point person on issues related to that country.

Friday’s exclusive is not the first time The Daily Mail has published never-before-seen material from Hunter Biden’s laptop. Last August, the outlet published “unearthed footage” of Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that, in the summer of 2018, another laptop went missing and he believed Russia had stolen it. At the time, Hunter also expressed concern that the laptop might prove fodder for blackmail since it contained compromising material.

What distinguishes the emails contained in last week’s Daily Mail article from those published last year is that the most recent release came the day after Russia’s State Duma speaker, Vyacheslav Volodin accused President Biden with being “involved in the creation of bio laboratories in Ukraine,” with Volodin claiming that “an investment fund run by his son Hunter Biden funded research and the implementation of the United States’ military biological program.”

Soon after Volodin made the charge on Thursday, the Telegraph called Russia’s accusation of Hunter Biden funding Ukrainian biological laboratories an “unsubstantiated claim” “designed to build on negative coverage about [the] president’s son in Right-wing US media.” But with Friday’s release of previously undisclosed emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop, Russia’s claim, at least concerning Hunter Biden’s connection to Ukrainian biological laboratories, appears accurate.

While none of the emails released on Friday support Russia’s claim that the Ukrainian labs were used to research or create bioweapons, propaganda need only hold a sliver of truth to serve its purpose. And the cache of emails contained on Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop provides Putin and his comrades enough evidence to seemingly confirm the Russian government’s earlier claim that Hunter Biden helped implement a bioweapon program in Ukraine. This false framing also provides Russia ammunition to justify its attack on its neighbor to the west.

Russia’s ability to point to the Hunter Biden emails as confirmation of its claims of a biolab in Ukraine raises a serious question with huge national security implications: How did Russia know the day before The Daily Mail’s exclusive that the Hunter Biden’s investment fund, Rosemont Seneca, had invested in Metabiota and been involved in Metabiota’s operations in Ukraine?

The timing of events last week suggests Russia has access to the same emails as The Daily Mail or that Vladimir Putin’s agents might well have obtained access to Hunter Biden’s first laptop—the one the president’s son believed Russians had stolen in 2018. In either case, the Biden family corruption documented on the laptops has gone from a potential national security risk to a real one—and in the midst of a war launched by Russia on a country bordering North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.

Together, the Biden family, the intelligence agencies, and the corrupt media—social and legacy—hold full responsibility for the danger Americans now face. Biden knew full well how compromised his family was, and that there were two laptops, not one, with evidence of the corruption floating about. Yet Biden lied to the American public, with an assist from the former high-level members of the intelligence community who signed the letter suggesting the laptop scandal represented Russian disinformation.

Then there is the FBI which, by December 2019, had access to the abandoned laptop and thereby also knew that Hunter believed Russians had stolen his laptop in summer 2018. To date, there has been no indication that the FBI provided Joe Biden a defensive briefing on the national security risk posed by those laptops. Or if FBI agents did brief Biden on the risks in a timely manner, that means he nonetheless lied to the American public and ran for president knowing the propaganda at Putin’s fingertips.

Even when coupled with the complicity of former members of the intelligence community, all of Joe Biden’s lies would mean nothing if the media had done its job and reported the story when it still matter. It’s too late now, however: Biden is our commander in chief and Putin potentially holds a cache of compromising information perfect for propaganda purposes.

Here Are All The People Who Advocated For Regime Change In Russia,"President Joe Biden advocated for regime change in Russia this week, but before his administration could soften his statement, plenty of people consulted by the corporate media to speak about the overseas crisis as “experts” agreed with the president’s original comments.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden declared about Vladimir Putin during his formal speech in Warsaw, Poland.

The corporate press called the outburst a “gaffe” to cover for Biden, who couldn’t decide between standing by his comments or downplaying them as simple “moral outrage” toward Putin. While the president flip-flopped, the White House scrambled to paint Biden’s bold statement as a mistake and quickly clarified that the sitting president of the United States was not, in fact, calling for regime change in Russia.

Even Biden’s eventual insistence that “nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin,” however, was contradicted and undermined by Twitter blue checkmarks, talking heads, and the corrupt corporate media, who say that toppling Putin’s regime, even if it means escalation, should be the U.S. government’s official stance.

In addition to trying unsuccessfully to compare Biden’s off-script declaration to President Ronald Reagan’s iconic “tear down this wall” charge, multiple warmongers tried to justify Biden’s radical regime-change remark with their own reasoning about how bad Putin is.

“Did Biden’s Gaffe About Putin Contain a Kernel of Truth?” one headline in the New York Magazine’s Intelligencer stated.

“Biden’s Putin ad lib wasn’t a gaffe. He was right,” The Washington Post’s Eugene Robinson wrote.

“Biden’s support for Ukraine and opposition to Putin were no ‘gaffe,’” Max Boot argued in the opinion pages of The Washington Post.

National Review’s senior editorial staff also collectively argued that while Biden’s comments were a “mistake,” they invoked an “understandable sentiment.”

“It will come as no surprise to Vladimir Putin that the U.S. would prefer to see someone else in charge in the Kremlin. And the U.S. is right to want this,” the article lede states.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul made several corporate media appearances following Biden’s comments where he argued that Biden wasn’t calling for regime change but that there’s nothing wrong with expressing that “Putin should not be in power.”

“Millions of people agree with the President of the United States, including millions of Russians,” McFaul said on MSNBC. “Every time we mention this moment, let’s remember that Vladimir Putin is not just saying things like Mr. Zelenskyy shouldn’t be in power. He has invaded Ukraine to try to do regime change there.”

One day earlier, McFaul tweeted that “Biden expressed what billions around the world and millions inside Russia also believe.”

Several different rationales were used to justify calling for Putin’s removal including labeling the drastic action as “basic humanity.”

Others such as disgraced Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson parroted the Russia collusion hoax as justification for considering U.S.-backed regime overthrow in Russia.

One Daily Beast columnist joined Wilson in hinting that it might be okay to escalate the overseas crisis in the name of replacing Putin because the Russian head “sought to effect regime change here in the United States– as our entirely intel and law enforcement community concluded.”

Other Biden allies didn’t quite call for Putin’s assassination, as Sen. Lindsey Graham did a few weeks ago, but they did express approval for finding ways to get rid of Putin.

Will The GOP Establishment Enable Another Disastrous Iran Deal?,"Image Credit LBJ LIBRARY/FLICKR

With corporate media focused almost exclusively on the war in Ukraine, the country is largely ignoring another impending foreign policy disaster with consequences that are potentially as great, if not greater, than what’s happening in Eastern Europe. The United States is on the verge of cutting another nuclear deal with Iran that is, if anything, even more wrongheaded than the one that was the signature foreign policy accomplishment of the Obama administration.

The poor performance of American negotiators isn’t the only similarity between what’s happening now and the original deal that former President Barack Obama struck with Tehran’s theocrats. The Republican establishment in Congress appears to be just as unwilling to take effective action to try to stop the Biden administration’s appeasement of Iran as they were in 2015.

While the details haven’t been officially released and last-minute disputes have caused delays, multiple legacy media outlets have been reporting for weeks that the United States and their P5+1 diplomatic partners (China, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Germany) are close to reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that former President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018.

Trump’s goals were to strengthen Obama’s deal by eliminating the sunset clauses that give Iran a path to a legal nuclear weapon by 2030, and to rein in Iran’s illegal missile building and support for international terrorism. There’s no way to know if his “maximum pressure” campaign of re-imposed sanctions could have succeeded had he been re-elected.

Dangerous New Deal

Former Secretary of State and current climate czar John Kerry advised the Iranians to simply sit tight and wait for Democrats to win in 2020. Now the Iranians have exhibited the same tough negotiating tactics that led to Obama and Kerry giving away their store in the 2015 deal.

The problem is that all of the restrictions the JCPOA imposed on Iran came with sunset clauses. At best, it kicked the nuclear can down the road to the following decade. The West was going to have to try to renegotiate it or face up to the fact that Obama had guaranteed that Iran would get a bomb.

But the U.S. team, led by special envoy and veteran Iran appeaser Robert Malley, not only failed to get Iran to give up the sunset clauses, reports from the negotiations indicate Malley has made further concessions. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — an organization that controls a significant portion of the country’s economy and guides its efforts as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism — would be delisted as an officially designated terror group by the U.S. government under one of the concessions that Malley offered in order to entice the Iranians to consent to rejoining the accord.

On top of that, in a development that has similarly attracted little corporate media attention, Biden has undermined his stand against Russian President Vladimir Putin by agreeing to demands that the new accord exempt Moscow’s business with Iran from the sanctions that Western nations have imposed on it as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.

Republican Response

The question then is what, if anything, Republicans will do about this. The answer is that they are as helpless to stop Biden as they were to halt Obama’s efforts.

Since the Obama administration didn’t go through the constitutional process of submitting the Iran deal to the Senate as a treaty where the Constitution would have required the assent of two-thirds of the Senate, they say that, regrettably, Biden also can’t be stopped. The subterfuge employed by Kerry, who openly mocked the GOP by boasting of evading the treaty ratification process as well as the executive branch’s control of foreign policy, will be the excuse in 2022 just as it was in 2015. But this preemptive surrender is just as indefensible now as it was then.

Demonstrating the appalling weakness in dealing with the Democrats that would lead a year later to the GOP electorate choosing Trump as their presidential nominee, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and then Foreign Relations Committee Chair Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., allowed themselves to be bamboozled into accepting a process by which the pact would theoretically be given congressional oversight.

The GOP leaders should have thrown down the gauntlet to Obama and told him that they would defund the State Department and refuse to confirm any diplomatic appointments until he respected the Constitution and submitted the deal for a treaty confirmation. But instead they agreed to pass the Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 that allowed the deal to go into effect so long as one-third plus one member of either house of Congress approved it.

Like so much of what the GOP establishment has done on a variety of issues that are important to the conservative base but not a priority for officeholders solely interested in retaining power, that act was a sham intended to make voters think congressional Republicans were doing something while, in fact, they were doing nothing.

Republicans Must Act

But now that Democrats are back appeasing Iran again, the response from congressional leaders is just as ineffective. Even though, unlike the case in 2015, the GOP doesn’t control the Congress, Republicans can still make a lot of trouble for Biden if they want to.

They can use their leverage in a 50-50 Senate to undermine funding for the State Department and to put a hold on all diplomatic appointments so long as Biden is flouting the Constitution by concluding a treaty without submitting it to the Senate.

But as they have at virtually every point when Obama or Biden stood their ground, Republican swamp-dwellers are showing again that they prefer to let their opponents get their way rather than act in a way that might cause themselves to be inconvenienced or called irresponsible.

In 2015, that meant allowing Iran to be enriched and empowered by a dangerous nuclear accord. But in 2022, it’s even worse, since we are far closer to the moment when the sunset clauses in the deal will expire and a terrorist-supporting state intent on achieving regional hegemony in the Middle East with the aid of Russia will be allowed by the West to get a nuclear weapon.

If that isn’t enough to jolt the congressional Republican leadership into taking drastic action, even if it means they will be branded as obstructionists (as was the case when many of the same leaders backed down and let Obamacare become law), then rank-and-file Republicans may be forgiven for asking why they are being asked to give the same people control of the House and Senate in the midterms later this year.

"America Shouldn't Go To War For Ukraine, But It Should Sell Weapons","History, analogy, logic and morality are all useful in weighing policy decisions — including those involving national security and war. But while useful, these have their limitations. Regarding national security, the bottom line is, as Henry Kissinger once said, “America has no permanent friends or enemies — only interests.”

Defining those interests and then balancing them with risks, considering tradeoffs, building public support to sustain policies: This is the hard part. Given America’s nature, morality often informs our foreign policies, and sometimes drives them, yet our national interests should always have primacy.

Defying Expectations

In his essay on March 23, Federalist Senior Editor John Daniel Davidson said “a protracted war of attrition is not in the American national interest, and that a U.S. strategy that enables and encourages such a war, in addition to the indifference it shows for the suffering of the Ukrainian people, is misbegotten in the extreme.”

How Davidson arrives at this conclusion is important. First, he acknowledges that the war “seems to be entering a new phase” — by which he means the Ukrainians are effectively resisting the Russian invasion of their nation. This comes as a surprise to much of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, including the CIA, which expected that Russia’s military campaign to topple the Ukrainian government and install a puppet would be over in three days. To be fair, Russian President Vladimir Putin expected this as well.

Now, with the war apparently transformed from a war of decisive maneuver into a war of attrition, Davidson suggests this doesn’t mean an eventual end to the war via the collapse of Putin’s rule, one way or the other. Rather, Davidson posits, “A bloody war of attrition could drag on for months” with the destruction of “vast swathes of Ukraine,” with Russia unlikely to “run out of soldiers and war materiel anytime soon.”

Davidson signals that America needs to reassess what role it is to play in this conflict, so long as it’s not based on the “neoconservative consensus in Washington.” He then says that role appears to be to force the conflict into a “prolonged war of attrition, or a western-backed insurgency inside Ukraine,” which the Biden administration seems to see as preferable to a peace agreement. But it is important here to understand that many conservatives who are not foreign policy neoconservatives also believe it is in America’s interest to help Ukraine stay in the fight.

Lastly, Davidson asserts that “Moscow has gambled everything on this war,” with Russia likely to draw “military forces from elsewhere “to make up for casualties and equipment losses in Ukraine.” He also cites the Russian use of “advanced weapons” such as hypersonic missiles while suggesting that the “specter of nuclear weapons” remains on the table.

A Crucial Debate on the Right

There’s a lot to unpack here and doing so is important for our national debate, especially for the vitally needed reassessment of conservative foreign policy in the post-Afghanistan, post-Iraq, post-Arab Spring interventionist era. If conservatives can generally agree now that, regardless of the initial rationale for going into Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, staying there, and in some cases, attempting to introduce democracy and rule-of-law in ancient, tribal lands, was a bloody, costly fool’s errand.

For the record, I have consistently warned against American interventions and nation-building for more than 30 years. I agree with John Quincy Adams that America “goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.”

Many conservatives have maintained since the end of the Cold War that it is in the U.S. national interest to stay focused on existential threats and that only nations with the military-industrial means to support conventional armies and deploy nuclear weapons can truly threaten America’s national existence. Thus, China and Russia are major threats — Libya and Afghanistan aren’t.

Returning to Ukraine, many, myself included, have advocated for sending the Ukrainian defenders military equipment they can use to better defend themselves, such as the MiG-29 fighters and S-300 long-range antiaircraft missile systems they already know how to use.

Davidson, however, opposes such weapons transfers, arguing that Ukraine is a core Russian interest with Davidson repeatedly referencing the possibility of Putin using nuclear weapons or starting a war with NATO if we “escalate” the war.

There are two problems with this approach, which parallels the Biden administration’s conduct in vetoing the transfer of Polish MiG-29s to Ukraine. First, it allows Putin to determine what is escalatory. Second, it risks fulfilling Davidson’s fear of “a bloody war of attrition” by denying Ukraine the equipment needed to preserve its national sovereignty while minimizing its own casualties.

Core interest or not, it makes close to zero sense strategically that Putin would seek to add enemies when he can’t easily vanquish the one he invaded a month ago. Putin will not knowingly provoke NATO into intervening directly in its war in Ukraine with combat forces.

In 10 years of combat in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union lost 15,000 soldiers, while killing up to 2 million Afghan civilians and fighters and displacing more than half the population of 13 million, generating 7 million refugees, 5 million of whom fled outside of their homeland.

In one month of fighting, Ukraine has reportedly killed 15,000 Russian troops. Russia may be pulling in forces from other parts of the nation, even the Far East, but some 55 percent of Russia’s ground combat power was committed in the initial invasion of Ukraine — they simply don’t have much more.

What’s more, the purported Russian use of hypersonic missiles betrays weakness, not strength. Such systems are no magic bullet and were likely used because a corrupt Russian regime has unexpectedly exhausted its stocks of precision-guided munitions (the money for weapons procurement having been long ago skimmed for the superyacht fund). Relatedly, we hear that up to 60 percent of Russian missiles are malfunctioning.

Ukraine has already shown the world that it has the will to fight and that it can fight effectively against Russia. As the great strategist Edward Luttwak recently tweeted, “Nations are forged in war — if they prevail against the odds as the Americans did against the Brits…” and “Ukraine is now doing, they are empowered to achieve great things.”

Self-defense is the first of the natural rights. Helping Ukraine defend itself, so long as it has the will and the capacity to do so, is moral. But warfare is brutal. It’s the nature of war. At its core, the object of war is to, as Carl von Clausewitz (someone the Russians take care to read) wrote, “…impose our will on the enemy… To secure that object we must render the enemy powerless.” Russia seeks to render Ukraine powerless to defend itself. The object of our policy ought to be to deny Russia that object — so long as the Ukrainians have the capacity and the will to resist.

Anticipating What Russia Will Become

Ukraine has successfully resisted Russia’s attempt to impose its will on Ukraine in a stand-up conventional fight. But Ukraine may eventually lose a conventional war. Even if Russia manages to occupy Ukraine, Ukraine may still prevail as did the Algerians against the French, or the Afghans against both the Soviets and the United States. This is why small nations often defeat the large, for what is a small war to a big nation is often a war of national survival to a smaller nation.

Returning to Clausewitz, “War is a trial of moral and physical forces by means of the latter… In the last analysis it is at moral, not physical strength that all military action is directed… Moral factors, then, are the ultimate determinants in war.” In Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have witnessed the clear moral superiority of Ukraine vs. Russia. We see it in the low morale of the Russian invaders and in the high morale of Ukrainians defending their homeland. We also see it in the reaction of the international community to Russia’s aggression.

It is in America’s national interests to block an ascendant alliance of dictatorial nations, with China and Russia at the forefront. This is also the moral policy — moral for America and for the world because a victorious and confident bloc of China and Russia would, necessarily, threaten all democracies.

Whatever Russia may become as the result of launching its invasion, we can be sure of one thing: it won’t become a nation willing to so cavalierly invade and kill its neighbors. Further, there may be a sympathetic realization in Beijing that invading Taiwan would levy an unbearable cost.

As for Ukraine, if it survives this crucible of conflict, as I expect it to, look for a dynamic, self-confident nation to emerge from the ashes — one confident enough to reform its corrupt institutions and attract investment.

Sometimes dissent is patriotism, especially when much of the neoliberal push for foreign entanglements stems from feminists’ globalist pipe dreams — as evidenced by the odd accusations of “toxic masculinity” against American foreign policy realists.

A recent Twitter reaction exemplifies this undercurrent in foreign policy positions. University of Chicago international relations professor John Mearsheimer has been long arguing that the West cozying up to Ukraine would push Russia to war. After that recently happened, he became a target among liberal foreign policy types who claimed he had provided Russia a pretext for its aggression.

“As a woman covering foreign policy, and simply as a woman in society who sees regular justification of male violence, in this case it’s Putin’s toxic masculinity against Ukraine — but Mearsheimer’s position isn’t just a ‘take,’ it is morally deplorable and based on misogyny,” tweeted Washington Post contributor Melissa Chan last weekend, adding that “Mearsheimer’s argument is basically the ‘she wore a short skirt’ justification.”

The tweet is eye-opening. It demonstrates America’s social hierarchy and explains how a country’s foreign policy blob is tied to the societal revolution in its universities.

Chan isn’t the only example. Students recently tried to “cancel” Mearsheimer on an American campus for the heresy of promoting “anti-Ukrainian ideology.” There is relentless propaganda insisting everyone from Tucker Carlson to J. D. Vance and most of the current Republican Party are Russian apologists because they do not want the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) involved in a nuclear war over Ukraine.

Why is this new line of attack important to understand? Because the elite disdain and animus for working-class conservatism (and all that entails) is reflected in the public outrage towards Russia. The same instinct that led to Mearsheimer being called a “toxic male” for arguing for caution against foreign intervention is the same instinct that leads to left-wing columnists equating Vladimir Putin with Republicans. The instinct for sacrificing working-class blood to promote a global feminist revolution is the same one that argues all truckers are fascists and terrorists.

Feminists: Everyone Else Is an Authoritarian

Consider a recent essay from Erica Chenoweth and Zoe Marks in Foreign Affairs, titled “Revenge of the Patriarchs: Why Autocrats Fear Women.”

“Understanding the relationship between sexism and democratic backsliding is vital for those who wish to fight back against both,” Chenoweth and Marks write, adding that both autocracy abroad and conservatism at home represent “nationalist, top-down, male-dominated rule” while “feminist movements are a powerful weapon against authoritarianism.”

Not just women, but “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people are seen as undermining the binary gender hierarchy celebrated by many authoritarians,” they continue. In short, Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, Putin, and the Taliban are all the same.

The last few paragraphs of the essay provide some guidelines. Those who wish to stop authoritarianism (both at home and abroad) should make “promoting women’s political participation central to their work,” and further, “Democratic governments and international institutions must also put defending women’s empowerment and human rights at the center of their fight against authoritarianism worldwide.”

Put simply, they want to see a global feminist revolution, with American working-class blood and treasure.

The Girlboss-ification of our Modern Foreign Policy

In a March 2020 article titled “The Best Foreign Policy Puts Women at the Center,” Rachel Vogelstein, Jamille Bigio, and Rebecca Turkington declared that “A foreign policy vision that announces itself as feminist has the advantage of making gender equality an implicit and explicit priority.”

There are think tanks dedicated to this vision. Glossy videos are produced for propaganda. NATO calls for a “Gender & Hybrid Deep Dive” which is “the first among a series of future sessions, including Gender & Resilience, Gender & Deterrence and Gender & Climate Change.”

The official U.S. Army Twitter account quotes Lana Del Ray, while Russia and China ban “sissy men” and “LGBT propaganda.” Mark Malloch-Brown, the president of George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, recently wrote that the crusade against a misogynistic Taliban must continue and:

…donor governments and private funders must back the local Afghan groups and individuals who have been courageously speaking up for good governance, the rule of law and human rights. They include women’s groups, independent journalists, and voices representing religious and ethnic minorities whose views must be reflected in any negotiation between the government and the Taliban.

Bad theory that is considered profound within the academy is often practically useless in policy. But sometimes, bad theories can lead to bad policies. Remember well that a disastrous Afghanistan crusade in part to promote female education, at the cost of trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, now lies in a sandy Bamian grave.

The common theme is that working-class conservatism, at home or abroad, is traditional and hyper-masculine, and therefore bad even when it leads to a balance of power and peace. Meanwhile, multilateral leftist and feminist policies are good — even when they are impossible to achieve and inevitably fail — because they are internationalist, egalitarian, and revolutionary.

It’s an aesthetic where logic is irrelevant. One cannot argue or debate with an aesthetic; it is impervious to realism. And the result is for all to see.

Feminists Want American Men to Fight Their Global Crusades

Just why should British and American taxpayers fund female empowerment across the globe, not just with treasure, but at times even with blood, and “stare down autocrats” ignoring the principles of Westphalian sovereignty so academics can write op-eds about “empowerment”?

What level of “empowerment” dictates asking men to go and fight foreign theocrats to promote a global foreign policy ensuring feminism? What benefit can working-class men suffering from lockdown-induced job losses gain from ensuring rights in every corner of the world? These are serious questions that need serious national debates.

Clintonist liberal feminists dream of a world ruled by “girlbosses” — dependent on working-class foot soldiers, whether they are truckers or Marines — maintaining and operating a neo-feudal global security state to perpetuate a sexual revolution from Afghanistan to Ukraine.

The rhetoric of “we must do something, or babies will die!” is used to perpetuate that worldview. The leftist rhetoric abroad is all about saving churches, defending borders, guarding statues, and defending women and babies from vandals. At home, the same people cannot define women, promote abortion, and are at the forefront of tearing down statues and patrimony.

As the story goes, a Roman patrician once came up with the clever idea of putting an armband on slaves, only to be shot down by his fellows, as then the slaves would know how much overwhelmingly greater in number they were and would rise up and topple the ruling class.

Conservatives are the silent majority. They are also patriotic, and often romantics who seek a noble cause — to fight the next battle between good and evil. Therefore, they can be susceptible to clever rhetorical manipulation by those who want them to fight wars on their behalf for utopian and revolutionary causes. But there are times to yell stop, and this is one of them.

Power is power. If the feminist-globalists feel so “empowered,” they should test that out on a foreign battlefield, instead of urging someone else to fight and die for them. Working-class conservatives should refuse to fund or fight for utopian revolutions around the world.

Biden's Lack Of Strategy On Ukraine Shows He's Got None For U.S. Either,"The White House said this week it plans to release up to 180 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves, a million barrels a day for 180 days, to help bring down near-record gas prices that were climbing before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but have since spiked. It will be the largest release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve since it was established in the early 1970s, and it probably won’t work.

The specific reasons it probably won’t work — congestion on the Gulf Coast, a possible reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia and other oil producers, the fact that 180 million barrels over the next six months isn’t enough to offset the loss of Russian oil exports — are not as important as what the announcement tells us about the Biden administration’s plan for Ukraine and how it fits into an overarching national security strategy for the United States.

What it tells us is this: Biden has no plan for Ukraine, and no overarching national security strategy for the United States.

The forthcoming release of oil is not unique in this respect. It’s just the latest in a string of seemingly haphazard, impromptu policies and pronouncements from the Biden administration that have sown confusion among our allies and projected weakness and indecision to the wider world.

Some fault Biden for not doing more to help the Ukrainians, some for doing too much and risking open war with a nuclear power. What these critics should share, though, is the belief that Biden’s contradictory signals over the past month — halfhearted and constantly shifting military aid to Ukraine, the absence of any off-ramps for Russia, total economic war on Moscow, virtually no effort to facilitate or encourage negotiations —have been perhaps more dangerous than any clear and consistent policy might have been.

As the war drags on, this problem is getting worse, not better — more chaos, less clarity. Consider the past week’s fusillade of so-called “gaffes” during Biden’s trip to Europe. He told members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in Poland they would see the bravery of Ukrainians “when you’re there,” suggesting U.S. troops would soon be going into Ukraine.

He said the U.S. would respond “in kind” if Moscow used chemical weapons in Ukraine, implying we would launch a chemical weapons attack on Russia. Then in his big Warsaw speech he blurted out that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” which sent White House aides scrambling to clarify that no, Biden was not announcing a policy of regime change in Russia, he was just saying Putin can’t be allowed to invade his neighbors. (But then on Monday, Biden said he makes “no apologies” for his statement and he’s “not walking anything back.”)

At this point, no one is sure what the Biden administration’s plan is to help end the war in Ukraine, what it thinks a stable peace might look like, or even if regime change in Moscow is really off the table as a matter of White House policy. Biden has announced no conditions for the easing of sanctions on Russia, articulated no vision for how Ukraine might “win” or what that might look like, and with each new Biden “gaffe” the window for the United States to take the lead in a negotiated political settlement narrows.

All this suggests Biden has no idea what the American national interest is or what our national security strategy should be — in Ukraine or anywhere else. He seems only to have a vague sense that large and powerful countries should not invade their smaller and weaker neighbors. But when they do, how should America respond? What goals or national interests should guide our response? What should our priorities be? Biden and his advisors don’t seem to know.

They had better figure it out. The Ukraine war heralds a new era in geopolitics, one in which rival powers like China will press their claims and pursue their ambitions with every tool they have. It’s not enough anymore to hide behind the platitudes of a “stronger-than-ever NATO alliance,” as if that alone encompasses the American national interest. It’s not enough to insist, as then-Secretary of State John Kerry did when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, that “you just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped up pretext,” as if just wishing it would make it so.

What we need now is that which we have least: clarity and resolve. We need clarity about our chief adversary, China, and the resolve to prioritize containment of China above all else.

Elbridge Colby noted recently in Time that a return to global military dominance, such as the United States enjoyed in the “unipolar moment” after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is not feasible now even with increased military spending. While we do need to spend more on defense, he says, what we need above all is a strategy that prioritizes “being able to deny China, our greatest challenge by far, the ability to subordinate Taiwan or another U.S. ally in Asia, while enabling us also to modernize our nuclear deterrent and sustain our counterterrorism efforts.”

If news reports about the Biden administration’s recently completed, classified version of the National Defense Strategy are accurate, then we’re in trouble. According to Foreign Policy, the administration apparently delayed rolling out its national security and defense strategies because the Pentagon was making last-minute tweaks in light of the war in Ukraine, “suddenly shifting focus from a U.S. defense strategy that had eyes on China.”

Shifting our focus from China is one thing we should not do. The war in Ukraine has underscored the need for a clear-eyed assessment of what the United States can and can’t do overseas, and what the national interests really are. We can condemn Moscow’s predation on its neighbor and work to ease the suffering of the Ukrainian people while also recognizing that our great security challenges aren’t in eastern Europe but in the Asian Pacific.

Indeed, we need not just a defense strategy to contain China but an economic strategy as well. That includes policies aimed at U.S. corporations that do business in China, allies that trade with China, and indeed a wholesale reassessment of global trade and global supply chains. China is in effect our only peer competitor, and without a laser-like focus on containing Beijing, even if it means letting Europe take more responsibility for its own security, we will likely find ourselves before long watching another large country invade a smaller one.

If that happens, let’s hope we have people in the White House who won’t be caught by surprise, wondering what to do, and making it up as they go along.

Why Did Biden Charge That Putin Might Use Chemical Weapons?,"The contrast between President John Kennedy’s mature statesmanship during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and President Joe Biden’s inflammatory handling of the Ukraine conflict was stark.

Kennedy and his Soviet counterpart Nikita Khrushchev edged back from the brink of nuclear war and negotiated a solution that respected the vital interests, and saved the faces, of both parties. Biden, perhaps deliberately, exacerbated the conflict, made negotiations between Russia and Ukraine more difficult, and raised the odds of a general war. Where Kennedy was self-disciplined, Biden revealed himself as irascible and irresponsible — a danger to global security. His administration has brought us to the point where, if we are lucky, the Second Cold War has begun or, if we are unlucky, the Third World War is about to start.

In Europe, Biden made three (supposed) “gaffes”: he called for regime change in Russia; he indicated that NATO forces would be in Ukraine; and he threated to reply “in kind” if Russia used chemical weapons.

Although his controllers attempted to walk back each of these statements, it is unclear whether Biden a) inadvertently blurted out what he and his controllers are actually planning; b) was suffering a flashback to his years in the Senate, when he could say anything without anyone’s paying attention; c) was floating trial balloons; or d) misunderstood the policies of what is nominally “his” administration.

Chemical Warfare?

It is worth exploring one of these “gaffes”: that Putin is considering chemical warfare.

This is a serious charge made at a serious moment. It came not long after Russia charged that the United States had sponsored bio-weaponry research in Ukrainian facilities. But Biden cited no evidence to support his claim.

The United Kingdom was more circumspect. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said that “Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation.”

Where Is the Evidence?

The world was left to wonder what evidence Biden had. The Biden-collusive media shows little interest in exploring that question. The Biden administration itself, as is its habit, expects us to believe that it has evidence merely because it says it does. Just a few weeks ago, when an Associated Press reporter pressed State Department spokesman Ned Price to disclose what evidence he had for a claim Price had made about Russian “disinformation,” Price repeatedly replied that the bare fact that he had made the claim was sufficient proof.

Yet it is doubtful that Russia, even if it possessed chemical weapons, would or even could use them. In a CNN interview, Gregory Koblentz, an authority on the subject, noted that if Putin did use chemical weapons, “it would not be too hard to trace back the use to Russia” and that it wasn’t clear “what the military value would be.”

Koblentz said that if the Russians were trying to kill Ukrainian civilians, “which is what chemical weapons are really good at, unfortunately the Russians have lots of conventional weapons that they can use very effectively,” and that “there’s some question about if Russia had chemical and biological weapons ready to go … Could they even use them effectively, given … how poorly they performed in … just supplying their forces with conventional firepower?”

Should We Trust Our Intelligence Agencies?

Biden’s defenders might retort that he based his charge on intelligence information — and that the disclosure of such information would compromise “sources and methods.” Or as Ring Lardner put it, “Shut up, he explained.”

U.S. intelligence agencies do not have a good record in matters like this. Maybe they got it right that Russia would invade Ukraine. But not long before, they (or the political masters to whom they reported) got it wrong in predicting when Kabul would fall to the Taliban and how strong a fight the Afghan military would put up.

And who can forget Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction? The Senate Report on Pre-War Intelligence in Iraq found that “[m]ost of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community’s October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) … either overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting.” Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, who chaired the investigation, said that “nobody inside the U.S. government had ever actually spoken to” Curveball, the source who provided “98 percent of the assessment as to whether or not the Iraqis had a biological weapon,” “except [for a single] Pentagon analyst, who concluded that the man was an alcoholic and utterly useless as a source.”

Russian ‘Disinformation’

Defenders of Biden’s claim might also point to Russian “disinformation” that the U.S. was sponsoring bio-weaponry research in Ukrainian laboratories.

Let’s assume that that was indeed “disinformation” — not because Biden says so, but because independent scientists, including some Russian scientists, reviewed the evidence that Russia produced and concluded that it didn’t support the claim.

Even so, that wouldn’t establish Biden’s counter-claims: it is a simple non sequitur to deduce that if Russia falsely accused the U.S. of developing bio-weapons, then the U.S. is right in alleging that Russia plans to use chemical weapons. At least the Russians produced “evidence” of a kind to substantiate their charges and convened a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss them. By laying out the “evidence” for its claims, Russia invited independent scrutiny of the kind that appears to have refuted them. But the U.S. hasn’t documented Biden’s charges. Let Biden disclose his “evidence,” summon the Security Council to meet, and permit independent experts to review it.

Why Did Biden Go Public with His Charge?

Biden need not have made his charges on the world stage. If he genuinely feared that Putin planned to use chemical weapons, he could have spoken privately to Putin and warned that the U.S. would respond “in kind.” Why did he go public?

Biden purported to be pre-empting a “false flag” operation that Putin could have used to make it appear that Ukraine had made first use of chemical weaponry. But (to speculate): what if Biden’s “false flag” allegation was itself a false flag? What if his purpose was to cover a U.S. “false flag” operation that staged a chemical incident, blamed Russia for it, and used the pretext to justify military intervention and regime change in Russia? If Putin can play mind games, so can we.

Finally, we are just starting to learn about the president’s son Hunter Biden’s activities in financing Metabiota, a Pentagon contractor sponsoring Ukraine-based research into lethal diseases. Possibly that research had no connection with bio-warfare; but possibly the product was weaponizable, not only toxic. Either way, we urgently need more knowledge about Hunter’s financial ventures in Ukraine — and how they might have influenced his father’s remarks.

Kamala Harris Is Everything The Media Warned Sarah Palin Would Be,"After more than a decade away from electoral politics, former GOP Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is going back on the ballot for the at-large House seat left vacant by deceased Rep. Don Young who died last month. It’s past time for the former vice-presidential candidate reclaim her stardom as a serious policymaker after the media nearly killed it in 2008.

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is everything the media frantically portrayed Palin was about to be 14 years ago. Ignorant, extreme, unprepared, and merely one 70-year-old’s heartbeat away from the presidency. Except while Arizona Sen. John McCain was 71 in 2008, President Joe Biden governs today at 79.

Harris offered her latest word salad this week in what’s become routine for the vice president dragging the administration down with abysmal favorable ratings. Watch what she had to say at a White House event with the prime minister of Jamaica on Wednesday:

VP HARRIS: ""One of the issues that has been presented as an issue that is economic in the way of its impact has been the pandemic… we will assist Jamaica in COVID recovery by assisting in terms of the recovery efforts in Jamaica that have been essential."" pic.twitter.com/fVSr8Km6co — Newsmax (@newsmax) March 31, 2022

If it were Palin at the podium, Saturday Night Live (SNL) would lead this weekend’s program with Tina Fey returning to reprise her role as the 2008 vice-presidential candidate. In fact, Fey will probably be back on the late-night skits as Palin once again by the end of the year mocking Palin’s run for the House of Representatives as the comedian did when the conservative lightning rod endorsed Trump in 2016.

Wednesday’s nonsense from Harris at the White House was relatively tame compared to the prior 14 months of nonsensical commentary from the nation’s president on stand-by.

Just last month, Harris appeared to confuse Ukraine as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), despite its pending membership of the western security apparatus at the heart of the conflict in eastern Europe.

“I will say what I know we all say and I will say over and over again: the United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance,” Harris said at the annual DNC meeting.

Harris made the same mistake again in a tweet days later.

Palin, in contrast, was depicted as a dunce when she suggested governing the state closest to the Kremlin-controlled landmass along its arctic border enhanced her foreign policy credentials with Russian land visible from Alaskan territory.

“I can see Russia from my house!” Fey mocked the governor on SNL who returned to the weekly comedy program to play the part.

Just 55 miles with islands in between on the Bering Strait however, even Slate conceded that yes, Palin’s was right when she claimed on ABC “you can actually see Russia from land, here in Alaska.”

Palin was asked again later in the campaign by Katie Couric, then at CBS, how governing Alaska equipped her to navigate complex global affairs. Her response wasn’t well-articulated, but it wasn’t outright inaccurate either, certainly not on the scale of misidentifying Ukraine as a NATO state when Russia’s invasion was launched over that very issue.

Palin, the most popular governor in the country wasn’t treated fairly in 2008, whose folksy attitude on the campaign trail was the subject of mockery from reporters who often trapped her in “gotcha questions” in nearly every memorable moment of the election. The same could not be said of Harris, whose unpopularity and extremism failed to propel her own presidential campaign even to the Iowa caucuses. GovTrack rated Harris, not Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, as the most liberal senator in 2019.

Harris’s pattern of quotable moments, on the other hand, has almost always come unprovoked in prepared speeches, or, as shown above, in a written tweet, with few exceptions. One exception stands out below where Harris explains the crisis in Ukraine as if she were a kindergarten teacher to an audience who are not kindergarteners:

Even after the media’s hostile coverage of the former Alaska governor in 2008, Palin’s popularity never dipped below 50 percent among constituents during her time in office despite her national reputation wrecked by the beltway circus. No vice-presidential candidate ever faced the kind of viscous and sustained character assassination as Palin did, by both the media and her own campaign.

While Biden’s team protected Harris on the trail, Palin’s handlers, Steve Schmidt and Nicole Wallace, were working to undermine the success of their own ticket selling out stories to reporters before the election was over. Wallace didn’t even vote for the campaign that employed the future MSNBC host.

If Palin’s run for Congress pans out, we can expect more of the same.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/02/kamala-harris-is-everything-the-media-warned-sarah-palin-would-be/,2022-04-02
Focusing On Russia Instead Of China Would Be The Biggest Mistake Ever,"Image Credit Aleksei/Flickr.

As we reach a month of the Ukrainian war amid talks of possible peace, a strategic appraisal is in order. It appears the Russians thought the war would be easy and fast, the Ukrainians would simply roll over and surrender, and the common people would rise up to greet Russians as liberators. Russian strategic decision-making, worsened by ideological bubbles, turned out to be as haunting as British and American misadventures in Iraq and Libya.

The Russian officer attrition in this war is on a level rarely observed in any recent conflict, partially because this level of high-intensity, state versus state, multi-domain total war hasn’t occurred in the last few decades. Russia did not foresee that its old-fashioned special operations tactics are obsolete satellites and drones track their movements.

The fact that Moscow did not calculate this in their battle plans is a sign of decline, a far cry from its prestigious officer corps training during the Soviet era. The bulk of the Russian navy and air force are still bafflingly underused and functionally unavailable given the intensity of the conflict, giving rise to the suspicion that the Russians are preserving their top-tier weaponry and platforms in case the war spirals to a continental conflict.

But, somehow, they are still grinding on. If their objective was to stop Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus from joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), they have achieved it already. They have also managed to cut off the entire east and south of Ukraine. Russia might still win the war and achieve Ukrainian zonal neutrality, given Russia’s sheer weight.

The Russian rhetorical “denazification” was also recently dropped quietly from the rhetoric. But the demand for Ukrainian neutrality remains and will remain. It was the single major Russian demand. All the other demands were maximalist and malleable, aimed towards negotiation.

Ukraine should have taken the opportunity to do a Cold War-era, Austrian-style “neutralitätserklärung,” which would have resulted in the country constitutionally turning neutral, in order to get funding from the European Union and NATO and flourish. Ukrainians have also swallowed their non-achievable EU and NATO membership dream and are currently just as ideologically inflexible and rigid about compromise as Russia.

Long-Term Ramifications

Unfortunately, the long-term ramifications of this war, for the west, are also bleak. Every single conservative restraint and realist gain from the last few years risks being reversed if realists continue to play defense on the rhetorical field of “values” instead of focusing on a narrow, populist interest.

The absolutely mindless idea of a no-fly zone in an active warzone with a nuclear great power was narrowly avoided by 78 experts writing an open letter against it. Incidentally, support for a no-fly zone declines among Americans the moment it is explained.

But the war hysteria in the first few weeks of the campaign, aided by the usual suspects, demonstrated just how close to power and catastrophe these ideologues were. When a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and a former supreme allied commander of NATO argue for a no-fly zone, one needs to remember they are one step away from real advisory power and might be so again in the future.

A conservative realist grand strategy that focuses on America’s southern borders and argues for Europeans to pay for European defense first needs a realist rhetoric and public relations strategy. It must discuss the public interest, in a language common people will understand and appreciate.

Pursuing such a strategy would require a total clean-up of the administrative state and Obama-era holdovers next time Republicans are in power. The hold-outs of liberal internationalism are deeply embedded within the ever-expansive national security bureaucracy.

War Is Burying Liberal Internationalism

Rampant war hysteria has resulted in limited diplomatic maneuverability, a realization that is slowly emerging. As the Financial Times noted, “since Feb 24, the west has been galvanised into more unity than it has shown in years. Yet most of the world is on the side lines waiting to see which way it goes. Not for the first time, the west risks mistaking itself for global consensus.”

No matter how many times fanatical liberal internationalists cry about this war suddenly rejuvenating liberalism, the reality cannot be further from truth. The war proves great powers can deter other great powers and are the only actors that matter, that nationalism is the strongest social force, that interests trump values, norms, and laws. Thus, the war is quite clearly not saving “liberal internationalism” but burying it.

Two of the largest non-western powers are either neutral or tacitly supporting Russia, simply because of the idea that great powers should have their own spheres of influence. The balancing powers in Europe also argued against NATO being a co-belligerent.

Realism Isn’t Isolationism At All

Anglo-American foreign policy realists are not pacifists or isolationists. They simply prioritize a greater strategic threat in China. Wars have their own momentum. The chance of a great power being dragged into war due to foolish or overzealous mistakes of smaller peripheral allies is a far bigger threat, as the current world is functionally similar to a multipolar system prior to the First World War than a relatively binary and Manichean conflict of the Second.

Russia, bogged down in Ukraine already, is not a hegemonic threat comparable to Nazi Germany. The EU’s total population is around 450 million, more than the United States (339 million) and much more than Russia (144 million). The EU’s gross domestic product also dwarfs Russia’s, and just the top four European defense budgets combined are larger than Russia’s. Yet, instead of an actual material pivot to Asia, the United States currently has more than 100,000 troops deployed in Europe.

Globally, the biggest future rival is China. China is almost incomparable in size and power next to previous rivals such as Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and even the USSR. There is nothing they would prefer more than the United States being dragged back to Europe.

Ultimately, the U.S. objective should be not to prolong the war, but to focus on China as a rising threat. Ukrainian neutrality would have sorted the issue for good. But Russia has already been pushed into the arms of the Chinese due to the war.

By not allowing an amoral balance of power, wherein we let Russia have a small sphere of influence as a grand bargain instead of being over-committed to Europe, Washington risks undercutting its long-term strategic interests by unknowingly accelerating China’s. In a twist of fate, President Joe Biden is now mirroring former President Donald Trump.

Biden’s old Cold War equilibrium instinct is under siege by his own activist administration, determined to defeat Russian “reactionary imperial patriarchy” and defend foreign borders, statues, and churches — instincts they would never allow at home. The almost theological focus on being a part of a conflict in the far corners of Eastern Europe to ensure the continuation of a liberal democratic revolution is fundamentally undercutting American grand strategy, which historically tried to split Russia and China.

Ultimately, pushing Russia to be a Chinese satellite might turn out to be our greatest historic blunder.

Why Energy Security Is National Security,"Image Credit GPA Photo Archive/Flickr.

In December 2008, Marine Corps Gen. James Jones (retired) wrote in a Wall Street Journal article that “You can’t use the word energy independence. It is not a valid phrase. It is designed to excite people. But it is simply not going to happen.”

That was a factually unsupported statement then, and remains so. At the time that Jones made this pronouncement, the U.S. Minerals Management Service was estimating that there were approximately 18 billion barrels (BBls) of oil and 77 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas in the Outer Continental Shelf. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that there were at least 10.6 BBls of oil and 8.6 Tcf of gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The potential for U.S. dominance has not abated. Texas, which currently leads U.S. states in oil production, has massive proven oil (11.1 BBls) and gas (93.5 Tcf) reserves. North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado round out the top five in terms of oil production. Crude oil is produced in 32 states. The top five natural gas-producing states are Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

Wyoming leads in coal production, and West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and North Dakota are critical coal-producing states as well. In 2019 it was estimated that Wyoming had 1.4 trillion tons of total coal resources.

The USGS has estimated there are likely 1 billion pounds of known and potential resources of uranium in deposits throughout Texas, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Arizona. Uranium is used in the 93 operable nuclear reactors in the United States, providing 20 percent of the nation’s electricity.

Although the United States led global uranium production in 1980, almost none is being produced domestically today. Almost 50 percent of our uranium fuel supplies now come from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The United States has massive amounts of domestic energy that we can produce right here, thereby creating thousands of jobs and enriching our economy.

Moving U.S. Energy Dominance Backward

In 2018, the United States became the largest crude oil producer in the world, becoming energy independent for the first time in more than 60 years. That feat defied Jones’s predictions from ten years earlier and was accomplished through technological advances, as well as the pursuit of a public policy focused on energy dominance and the recognition that developing domestic energy supplies is always in the best interests of our country.

In just the last year we have gone from a 4 percent surplus of domestic oil and gas production to a 4 percent deficit — a swing of 8 percent in 12 short months. This state of affairs did not happen by accident or because of a lack of readily and economically accessible energy resources. We have more than enough oil, natural gas, coal, and uranium to power this country into the distant future, and the technology to do so, while protecting our environment.

This situation is instead the direct result of the misguided and destructive federal policy decisions that do nothing to protect the environment while empowering Russia to advance its plans for regional and international dominance.

It’s Hard to Come Up with a Worse Energy Policy

It is important to note that Congress had no involvement with the decision to instantaneously reverse the United States from energy independence back to energy dependence. This loss was not due to a change in the laws that apply to our energy industries. Nor was it because of new developments exposing additional dangers in fracking, oil production, coal mining, or construction of the related infrastructure (such as pipelines or deep-water ports).

We are in this situation for one simple reason: the current administration has chosen to punish America. It has put us last on the world stage, placing an embargo on new energy development here while enriching and empowering Russia to produce even more oil and natural gas to meet world demand, at the very time that Russia is invading the independent country of Ukraine.

Our energy policy, in other words, is not only making us poorer, causing rampant inflation, and weakening our position in the world, it is enriching and empowering one of the few countries on earth that is willing to invade another sovereign nation based on recognizing that the only countries that could stop its advance depend on it for their energy.

This administration was importing 600,000 barrels of oil a day from Russia, an amount that could have easily been replaced by the 800,000 barrels of oil a day to be carried by the Keystone XL pipeline, which President Biden killed with a stroke of his pen on his first day in office. Meanwhile, President Biden has approved billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine.

Paying for Both Sides of the War

To be more blunt: we are paying for both sides of the land war currently raging across eastern Europe, all because of the misguided energy policies of this administration.

The U.S. ruling class and their counterparts in Europe have, for the last 30 years, pursued a pact of mutual destruction, hollowing out our core of energy, food, and intellectual independence. We have empowered federal agencies to make law, enforce “laws” that don’t exist, declare millions of acres of land off-limits to access and production, and compromise private property and water rights.

The Biden administration has tried to convince people that we can continue to enjoy our historically high standard of living while destroying everything that makes that standard of living possible.

Dependent on Totalitarians

The world stage is now set: Our “liberal democracies” are dependent on totalitarian and destructive regimes, and the mad dash to try to deflect from that reality has begun. The saber-rattling, the tough talk, and the genuflection to “world order” are designed to gloss over the fact that if Western democracies had not chosen to destroy our energy independence, we wouldn’t be in this mess in the first place.

This is not complicated for those of us who have even the most basic understanding of reality. If you are dependent on another country to supply you with energy, they will control your policy. If you are dependent on another country to supply you with food, they will control your policy. If you are dependent on another country to supply you with everything your society needs to live (pharmaceuticals, etc.), they will control your policy.

Stated even more succinctly: Energy dependence = energy insecurity; energy insecurity = instability; instability = empowerment of rogue nations.

We are not going to get out of this quagmire anytime soon. We can, however, use all of our tools to expose how those energy policies that weaken America will ultimately strengthen countries that are willing to invade another country.

If we want to restrain tyranny, we must produce our own energy. If we want to enable tyrants, we continue down the path of dependence on their energy production.

More Receipts Show Depth Of Biden Family Profiteering With Foreign Enemies,"Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin released new documents on Monday indicating that President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden and his brother James Biden were extensively involved with and profited from business deals with companies that operate on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and other corrupt regimes.

These new findings support what Grassley and Johnson both documented in their 2020 investigation into the Biden family’s corruption, but they have yet to catch due attention from the corporate media.

“These new records support the findings in our reports from last Congress in September and November 2020 — reports that the liberal media and our Democratic colleagues said were Russian disinformation,” Grassley said in his address to the Senate floor on Monday. “Forget the facts, forget the evidence, forget investigative journalism. The liberal media wanted to provide cover for then-candidate Joe Biden. They did whatever they could to smear our investigation.”

Much of the blame for this lack of attention, Johnson added in his floor speech, lies with their Democrat colleagues and the former intelligence officials who penned the sham letter claiming that information discovered on Hunter’s abandoned laptop was Russian disinformation.

“By casting doubt on evidence of the Bidens’ corrupt practices, these former intelligence officials interfered in the 2020 election to a far greater extent than Russia could have ever hoped to achieve,” Johnson said. “Their willing accomplices in the press amplified this disinformation letter and by doing so were equally guilty of egregious election interference.”

The Bidens Profited from CCP-Linked Business

Grassley and Johnson previously established that the Bidens were deeply involved with an energy company controlled by the CCP. As a result, that company, CEFC, funneled millions to Hunter to offer legal representation to the “spy chief of China,” Dr. Patrick Ho Chi-Ping. The same month that money was transferred to Hunter’s company Owasco through a middleman company, Ho was arrested for corruption and bribery.

Ho contacted James when he was arrested, but new documents released by the Republican senators show that Joe Biden’s brother, too, is guilty of receiving vaguely attributed funds from some of communist China’s biggest players.

Combined, James and Hunter’s companies received upwards of $4.8 million from CEFC, “an arm of the Chinese government,” between August 2017 and September 2018. James’s company Lion Hall Group alone received $1.4 million from CEFC via at least 20 wire transfers from Hunter’s company Owasco, something The Washington Post only recently admitted.

In addition to receiving money from CEFC, Hunter and James both profited off of numerous deals with CCP oligarchs and operated companies that shelled out tens of thousands of dollars to communist-connected businesses.

James was named a manager at Hunter’s company Hudson West Three in August 2017. At the time, the agreement designated $100,000 to Hunter and $65,000 to James every month. This lucrative deal was made possible after Northern International, a company with deep connections to communist China partner and CEFC founder Ye Jianming, wired $5 million to Hudson West Three that same month.

At the same time that Hunter’s company Hudson West Three was making payments to a CCP-controlled company, Hunter and James were also receiving wire payments with thousands of dollars. Recently released receipts show Owasco was entitled to several $165,000 wires from Hudson West Three in January of 2018. James’s company The Lion Hall Group also received nearly $18,000 from Hudson West Three the same month that several CEFC wire payments were made.

Receipts from April 2018 show that Hudson West Three, under the leadership of James and Hunter, wired tens of thousands of funds to Coldharbour Capital. This company was connected to Ye Jianming’s associate Mervyn Yan, who has strong ties to the communist regime in China.

“These transfers aren’t by accident. There’s clearly a scheme here,” Grassley said. “There’s a plan among and between all these individuals and their respective companies.”

The April receipts also show Hunter’s Owasco received another payment of $165,000 and James’ Lion Hall Group accepted a wire for roughly $34,000 for “office expense and reimbursement.”

In addition to presenting the sketchy payments from Hudson West Three, Grassley and Johnson produced bank records and credit card authorizations from September 2017 that confirmed that Hunter and James “went on $99,000 global spending spree courtesy of Gongwen Dong,” a Chinese executive and one of Hunter’s associates.

“The spending spree included airline tickets, purchases at Apple stores, hotels, and restaurants,” Grassley noted.

“With these new records, there can be no doubt that James Biden was financially connected to corporations and individuals with extensive links to communist China,” Grassley said. “And that he and Hunter Biden were in it together, working to help a Chinese government-linked energy company pursue deals and expand its reach in the energy sector.”

The Bidens Made Sketchy Deals Outside China

As Johnson noted in his floor speech on Monday, the Biden family business extends far beyond just striking deals with Chinese energy companies. There is and has been plenty of evidence suggesting that Joe, James, and Hunter were monetarily involved with multiple foreign oligarchs, especially in Ukraine.

Hunter exploited his father’s political reputation to strike business deals with oligarchs in Ukraine and China, a fact that was apparent even before the laptop emerged. Hunter may have even possibly given a portion of his equity deals to his father, but the legacy press refuses to report on that significance.

Despite Joe’s adamancy that he knew nothing of his son’s overseas business dealings, documents suggest that the now-president was actively engaged with his son’s business partners during his vice presidency.

Mere months after the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine in February of 2014, Joe met with Hunter’s business partner Devon Archer at the White House. Days later, Joe jetted off on an official White House trip to Ukraine because he was considered the “public face of the [Obama] administration’s handling of Ukraine.” One day after Joe’s visit to the Eastern European country, Archer was named to the board of Burisma. Less than one week after that, Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky had $23 million from multiple accounts seized by British officials.

A timeline of the Biden family’s involvement also shows that Hunter’s investment firm Rosemont Seneca Thornton received $3.5 million to “the corrupt and now-sanctioned wife of the former Mayor of Moscow,” Elena Baturina, at the same time of the revolution. A few months later, Hunter joined the Burisma energy company board despite having no previous experience in the energy sector.

“It is quite interesting to see how much significant activity involving the Bidens and corrupt actors in Russia and Ukraine occurred within a six-week period only two months after the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity. It sure looks like they intended to cash in on the turmoil in Ukraine,” Johnson noted.

Despite these congressional and journalistic findings, the corporate media dismissed any and all allegations against the Bidens as disinformation. The press not only failed to report on these bombshell findings but also refused to ask the president about his suspect involvement with Hunter’s business partner, Burisma, and the CCP-controlled firm that offered Hunter a massive payout.

Even now, after The Washington Post and The New York Times reluctantly admitted that Hunter’s abandoned laptop publicized in 2020 was legitimate, Johnson and Grassley agree that the press is “not telling the whole truth.”

“My guess is that they learned a lot from their coverage of Nixon’s Watergate scandal cover-up. They learned that when you’ve been caught in a cover-up — and that is what has happened here — you try to limit the damage by telling a little bit of the truth,” Johnson said.

There is a long list of questions from Johnson and Grassley about whether the Department of Justice and the U.S. intelligence communities have collected information about Hunter, Joe, James, and their communications with elites in countries that are the sworn enemy of the U.S. These questions, however, have gone unanswered for nearly two years.

Despite mounting evidence that the president and his family are deeply entrenched with and financially bound to foreign oligarchs, the Republicans said that the Biden administration has “been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests.”

Those Most Willing To Risk War With Russia Are Less Likely To Fight It,"Image Credit Pexels

The threat of nuclear war looms over the war in Ukraine. A war between the United States or its North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia represents a credible potential threat of doom for much, if not all, of mankind. This should be an obvious opinion-shaping factor for the average person, but it seems frustratingly unmentioned or glossed-over in media coverage. We have become less aware and less intelligent than our Cold War predecessors.

And less intelligent we would be to embrace a potential nuclear world war. A casual review of my social media feeds has made this painfully clear. People who are educated, gainfully employed, and recognized as such have written terrifying vagaries like, “force will be used;” “more and more lethal aid;” “Americans will die. Europeans will die. Russians will die;” and, “It is time to directly confront Moscow militarily with all of NATO’s power and force.”

Unfortunately, polling shows these attitudes are not merely anecdotal LinkedIn anomalies. A Rasmussen poll from early March revealed just 37 percent of Americans earning under $30,000 annually supported U.S. military involvement in the event of a wider war in Europe; a staggering 66 percent of those earning more than $200,000 supported such an endeavor in that poll. The most shocking – and, arguably, most troubling – numbers were the 51 percent of those earning $50,000-100,000, and 52 percent of those earning $100,000-200,000, who would support such military action.

The opinions of the upper and lower classes are easily understandable. Low-income individuals are unlikely to fare well in event of a global catastrophe; high-income individuals are most likely to find refuge in event of war and enjoy diversified financial portfolios and are least likely to send children into combat. Why, though, should a slight majority of the professional-managerial class support such a potential calamity?

I propose this partial explanation: many segments of our society are no longer capable of nuance. Everything must be black-and-white. If Vladimir Putin has engaged in an illegal, immoral, and irrational war in Ukraine (to be clear, he has), he must be “literally Hitler,” as some of the more profound Twitterati have declared. Or, at the very least, he must be some kind of one-dimensional Bond villain. These interpretations are unhelpful in a highly complex, interconnected world with nuclear weapons.

Furthermore, the professional-managerial class must stake a claim to its importance and moral superiority. Professor and author Catherine Liu suggests this segment of society is “convinced of its own unassailable position as comprising the most advanced people the earth has ever seen. Additionally, it insists on “its ability to do ordinary things in extraordinary, fundamentally superior and more virtuous ways.”

If the working class doesn’t want its children to go to war, the professional class must maintain they are simple-minded. If Russian political interference (whether facts support it or not) is connected to former President Donald Trump, then the professional class must despise Russia to maintain a place in polite society. Disappointingly, even something as terrible as nuclear war seems worth the effort of the professional class to separate itself from the working class.

To be clear, a significant percentage of the professional-managerial class, from both left and right, is deeply opposed to escalating this war. Many of us within the younger part of its ranks have never seen the United States win a war, even against relatively inconsequential countries in the developing world.

The memories of 2008’s recession haven’t faded; nor have doubts over our entire electoral process. Neither party seems capable of governing for more than two years. In light of all this, why should we trust those urging us into a war that will inevitably further disrupt our lives, if not end them outright? Escalation of this war is an idea the professional-managerial class should reject unequivocally.

So I implore my fellow middle-class Americans to stop the irresponsible saber-rattling. This isn’t our war. This isn’t an excuse to send our children to slaughter. This isn’t worth nuclear missile attacks. Challenge Putin’s madness, but please don’t get us into a war we will surely regret.

Biden Admin Prioritizes Climate Fantasies While Global Famine Looms,"President Joe Biden says he is “working out” how to mitigate global food shortages. But action speaks louder than words — and so does inaction.

Global food supply chain chaos has increased due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Countries across the globe are scrambling to increase food production. However, America is not one of them, because President Joe Biden would seemingly rather virtue signal about climate change than act on the near-term implications of a global famine.

Ukraine is the breadbasket of Europe, with soil similar to that of the American Midwest. It is one of the largest exporters of wheat and corn in the world. Those exports were a lifeline for millions of people, including many who live in “global crisis zones” and have no reliable agriculture of their own — until now.

The World Food Program warned Ukraine’s supply chain is “falling apart.” Those problems will worsen if Ukrainians cannot plant crops this spring.

On top of this, Putin threatened to restrict food sales from Russia — also one of the world’s largest exporters — to only “friendly” countries. Understanding the impending crisis, the European Commission has opened up conserved agricultural land for cultivation and distributed $550 million to European farmers to increase production.

Last week, I asked the Biden administration to take similar steps by opening “approximately four million acres of high quality farmland” for production that are currently held under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).

President Biden refused. As an explanation, his Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told the National Grain and Feed Association that re-opening the farm land would have “a significant and detrimental impact on producers’ efforts to mitigate climate change.”

This is not the first time President Biden placed his environmentalist image above common sense and human life. U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry’s obsession with cutting a Green New Deal with Communist China caused him to overlook slave labor in Xinjiang. Moreover, President Biden refuses to expand domestic energy production because, in the words of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, additional domestic production would be “upending our initiatives to save the planet from the climate crisis.”

At every turn, the Biden administration embraces climate fanaticism as a means to enrich its favorite corporate donors and appeal to a small fringe of the Democratic Party’s base, while empowering monsters like Xi Jinping, Ayatollah Khamenei, and Nicolas Maduro — who have little regard for human life, labor standards, or the environment. Administration insiders may think their “out of sight, out of mind” approach is politically savvy, but their self-delusion has real-world consequences.

Opening up four million acres of CRP lands to cultivation will not destroy the climate, but it may save lives. Now is not the time to “monitor the crisis” in Ukraine — now is the time to harness America’s vast resources to fend off a global famine. Biden needs to rethink his priorities, and fast. There is no time to lose.

"Ukraine War Enters New Phase, With Russia Moving East","Image Credit Russian Presidential Executive Office/Wikimedia

It’s been six weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, aiming to topple the government in Kyiv in a lightning strike. But contrary to much of Western and Russian intelligence, the Ukrainians refused to be cowed. They fought back adroitly, exploiting Russian weaknesses in training, morale, logistics, maintenance, and command and control. And now the war is entering an entirely new phase, one that may grow more dangerous for Ukraine with time.

Military intelligence officers are taught to look at the terrain, weather, and the enemy threat. Ukraine’s border with Belarus and the westernmost portion of the Russian border is replete with marshes, rivers, and forests. In the best of weather, it’s not ideal for mechanized operations — tanks, other tracked vehicles, and trucks. During a mild winter with no hard freeze, with the Ukrainians having preemptively flooded much of the terrain, it’s even worse.

This is where the Russian main effort stalled. It could not be adequately resupplied, likely due to both Ukrainian efforts, the poor road network, and bad cross-country mobility. That Russia tried to attack through this area shows one or both of two things: utter contempt for Ukraine’s military capacity (likely a view Russia no longer holds), and a failure to conduct the most basic intelligence preparation of the battlefield.

Russia Moving East

Russia’s defeated forces in the vicinity of Kyiv have now mostly retreated or been pushed out of Ukraine by steady Ukrainian counterattacks. These forces are moving to the east, likely in the vicinity of the Russian cities of Kursk and Belgorod, to refit, take on replacements, and undergo training before being assigned to Russia’s renewed offensive effort in the eastern Donbas Basin region.

Unlike the terrain north of Kyiv, this area features mostly open terrain except along the Siverskyi Donets River running roughly east-southeast from Izyum — recently captured by the Russians — to Lysychansk, which remains under Ukrainian control. And while the ground is still soft, it is still more amenable to cross-country movement, playing into the three main Russian strengths: artillery, tanks, and air support.

The next phase of Russia’s offensive will likely be aimed at dislodging the 70,000 well-equipped Ukrainians who have been fighting the Russian-officered separatist forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014. These 70,000 troops represent about one-third of Ukraine’s active-duty army. They benefit from high morale, excellent training, and extensive fortifications that allow them to readily block Russian penetrations. But fortifications are fixed, and if the Russians can get behind them, the Ukrainians will have to pull back to the west or risk being surrounded.

Putin’s Best Chance for Victory

Further complicating the situation in the east is the brutal siege of Mariupol, along the coast of the Sea of Azov. If Russia finally secures the city, it may be able to mount an assault from the south, presenting Ukraine’s defenders with a double envelopment. Or it may be that the Russian forces reducing Mariupol to rubble will themselves be spent — achieving a pyrrhic victory that can add little to follow on success directly north.

If Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army can adjust and overcome or compensate for its weaknesses, this will be the place and the battle that offers Putin his best chance for victory.

This new fight puts a premium on tanks and airpower — both areas of Russian superiority. This makes the Czech Republic’s provisioning of about a dozen Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine all the more important.

Additionally, both the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic have provided other tracked vehicles, artillery, and ammunition to Ukraine. Both nations are also said to be preparing to lend their military repair capabilities to restore battle-damaged Ukrainian and captured Russian equipment back to fighting shape. Ukraine has captured some 500 tanks and other tracked vehicles.

Ukraine will need all that assistance and more, if it hopes to withstand overwhelming Russian firepower. That the Czechs — where Russian agents were blamed for destroying some 150 tons of Soviet-era ammunition in 2014 — and Slovaks have provided Ukraine with armor shows that much more can be done short of sending NATO troops to Ukraine, the one action that is certainly a red line that Putin will not tolerate without a response.

"Without Uranium Mines, U.S. Runs Risk Of Reliance On Russian Energy","Europe’s fragile energy markets vulnerable to Russian interruption may soon be uncomfortably similar to the American power grid if policymakers aren’t careful about pushing a low-carbon future.

With a third of European oil and more than 40 percent of its gas provided by Russia, President Vladimir Putin has threatened to shut off the lights across Europe in an effort to counter western sanctions imposed in retaliation for the Kremlin invasion of Ukraine, demanding payment in Rubles instead of Euros.

“If such payments are not made, we will consider this a default on the part of buyers — with all the ensuing consequences,” Putin warned. “Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity, either. That is, existing contracts will be stopped.”

The deadline came and went, with Russian gas still flowing after European leaders called Putin’s bluff. The cold reality of European reliance on Russian energy supplies, however, has continued to handicap the diplomatic options available to western leaders while global markets face turbulence from sanctions on Moscow’s oil. Putin also trimmed exports to keep European reserves “below the minimum volume” for the first time in the half a decade preceding his invasion.

A ban on Russian oil, a financial gold mine for the Kremlin’s war machine providing more than 10 percent of global supply, was initially absent in the first sanctions package handed down by the United States and its allies following the assault on Ukraine. President Joe Biden unilaterally banned Russian oil imports for two weeks after the full-fledged offensive with European leaders slow to follow. It wasn’t until this week the EU proposed a ban on Russian coal while considering new restrictions on oil and gas. In the meantime, Europe is scrambling to replace its dependence on Russian energy supplies, with Germany even warning citizens to prepare for rations as it enters the official first stage of crisis management.

The United States was able to bar Russian oil imports with relative ease since only 3 percent of imported crude came from Moscow’s reserves. That’s still no small amount, and Americans are now coping with the highest gas prices on record as the Biden administration refuses to unleash domestic production to offset the interruption. If America truly embraces the long-term path of a sustainably fossil-free future, however, it has to go nuclear. Doing so without a re-assessment of the nation’s uranium suppliers could make the United States just as dependent on Russian fuel as Europe is today.

Nuclear power from 93 reactors currently generates 20 percent of the U.S. electric grid and is the source of 55 percent of carbon-free energy, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI). While the 2022 annual outlook from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) keeps the share of nuclear-generated electricity on the power grid consistent over the next 30 years, Daniel Turner, the founder and executive director of the non-profit Power the Future, faults the government’s forecast for being too optimistic about the ability of renewables to experience exponential growth as predicted.

The numbers, Turner told The Federalist, rely too much on capacity, explaining it’s “a false statistic because if the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine, it doesn’t matter how much capacity” exists. Europe’s recent low-wind winter while Russia weaponized its resource relationship gave the continent a rude awakening.

“Assuming full capacity is met, those numbers are great,” Turner said. Yet full capacity would also mean devastating impacts to wildlife given the sheer amount of land required to substitute conventional energy with wind and solar. Just this week, a wind power company was fined millions after executives pled guilty to killing at least 150 protected eagles by turbines.

Nuclear power, therefore, has become an attractive emissions-free alternative to wind and solar, drawing bipartisan support to meet the nation’s 21st-century energy needs without producing more carbon. Despite the endorsement of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the United States is a long way off from ramping up nuclear power without significant vulnerabilities in the supply chain.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. uranium production fell to an all-time low in 2019 while sourcing 46 percent of the mineral from Russia and Russian allies in 2020. Uranium was also dropped as a critical mineral by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) last year, a decision western senators have taken issue with as the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources holds a series of hearings to examine the need for domestically-sourced resources.

“I’m worried about our domestic reliance on imported uranium, specifically and especially Russian-imported uranium,” Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said as he began his questioning to an expert panel at a March hearing. “I think this poses a significant strategic risk to the United States. I’m also worried that the recent decision by the Biden administration to remove uranium from its critical minerals list is something that could have very real, harmful, lasting consequences.”

Scott Melby, the president of the Uranium Producers of America, said there was ample reason for concern.

“We’ve become a little lackadaisical about the supply of uranium,” Melby said, explaining the situation was borne out of commercial interest despite the U.S. being home to “over a billion of known and likely resources” which could be mined with “the highest environmental standards” of anywhere in the world.

As the Biden administration maintains an aggressive push for renewable energy, the White House has remained reluctant to draw minerals required for this from American lands, instead relying on trade with overseas adversaries and scaring off investment from U.S. projects. While Russia sources American uranium, China holds the monopoly on “rare earth” minerals required for electric cars.

“We’ve got to pay attention to our uranium industry,” Melby told lawmakers. “Countries like Russia, China are playing the long game. They’re acquiring resources all over the world.”

For the time being, Turner told The Federalist, “buying our uranium from Russia is no different from having 3 percent of our oil from Russia.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/08/without-new-uranium-mines-u-s-runs-risk-of-european-style-reliance-on-russian-energy/,2022-04-08
Elites' Human Rights Virtue-Signaling Doesn't Apply To China's Barbarism,"Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began nearly two months ago, American elites have taken the concept of virtue signaling to a whole new level.

Whether it’s comedian Amy Schumer’s ill-fated attempt to book Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for an appearance at the Oscars or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s bizarre performance of a Ukraine-inspired poem on St. Patrick’s Day, the idolatry of Zelensky and his country is in a league of its own. While this isn’t to say Russia’s violent acts aren’t grotesque, the purported concern for human rights among America’s ruling class remains weightless given their silence over another atrocity taking place on the opposite side of the world.

In China, the country’s ruling Communist Party (CCP) is engaged in a brazen assault on the natural rights of its civilian population. Following a reported rise of coronavirus cases in the city of Shanghai, the communist government has been pursuing a strict “Covid zero” policy, in which state authorities seek to contain and eliminate all cases of the respiratory virus. To accomplish this unrealistic goal, the CCP has shut down its largest city, with police forcing citizens to remain locked inside their homes against their will.

Such a policy has led to immense suffering among Shanghai residents, as reports indicate that “food shortages, lack of access to medical care, overcrowded quarantine centers,” and incidents of “infants [being] separated from their parents” are becoming widespread across the city. Citizens who demonstrate opposition to their government’s Covid approach face immediate detainment, with numerous videos showing state police harshly arresting individuals for noncompliance.

In addition to Shanghai, multiple other Chinese localities have begun to increase restrictions in anticipation of rising cases, including the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone, Xian, and Suzhou.

Despite such barbaric acts, American elites have opted for silence when it comes to criticizing the CCP over the societal shutdown. While corporations such as The Walt Disney Company were quick to offer condemnation of the Ukraine invasion and halt all theatrical film releases in Russia, the entertainment company infatuated with grooming children has yet to criticize the Chinese government for starving its own people. Hollywood is known for caving to China’s content demands.

The move from Disney is unsurprising, given that the company filmed its live-action “Mulan” reboot in China’s Xinjiang region, where the CCP is currently holding an estimated 2 million Uyghur Muslims in internment camps. In the end credits for the movie, Disney thanked multiple CCP propaganda departments in the region, evoking the ire of human rights activists and organizations.

In the political world, the willingness to turn a blind eye to China’s inhumane behavior is very much the same. Among the standouts is Democrat California Rep. Eric Swalwell, whose Twitter feed and media appearances include numerous examples of outcry over the Russian onslaught of Ukraine, but contain no mention of the CCP’s brutal treatment of Chinese civilians. Also noticeably quiet on China’s abuses is Sen. Mitt Romney. While the Utah Republican has time to tweet about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he’s apparently too busy to recognize the suffering of the Chinese people.

Put simply, the choice among America’s ruling class to remain silent over the human rights abuses in China has nothing to do with ignorance and everything to do with agreement. It’s not that our elites aren’t aware of what’s happening in China, it’s that they either don’t care or actively support the lockdown policies of the CCP. Just as these same entities and institutions sat idle while our Canadian neighbors to the north peacefully demonstrated against their government’s authoritarian Covid mandates, they will continue to do the same with respect to Shanghai.

No matter the amount of pain or anguish caused, the elitist belief that government is the answer to every societal problem will continue to persist, leaving millions to suffer in its wake.

Joe Biden’s Weakness Encouraged Putin’s Invasion Of Ukraine,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this week, two months after Russian troops invaded his country. Given this, it is important to underscore that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have sent his forces into Ukraine in the first place if President Biden had not demonstrated such weakness on the world stage in his first year in office.

Four U.S. presidents have been elected so far this century, and, with Putin effectively in power in his country for the entire time, Russia has invaded a neighboring country on the watch of three of those four presidents. In 2008, during President George W. Bush’s last year in office, Russia invaded Georgia. In 2014, under President Barack Obama, Putin sent his forces into Ukraine, annexing Crimea, and he did so again eight years later, one year into Biden’s tenure.

Say what you want about our 45th president, but Donald Trump remains the only U.S. president elected this century during whose term Putin decided not to invade a neighboring country.

The reason Putin did not do so was that Trump demonstrated undisputed strength on the world stage, in everything from knocking heads with his NATO partners and getting them to pay their fair share in that alliance, calling out Germany for its dependence on Russian oil and gas, eliminating the ISIS caliphate and killing its leader al-Baghdadi, deterring Iran, standing up to China, beginning the pullout from Afghanistan after 19 years of war in that country, forging the first peace agreement between Israel and several of its Arab neighbors in a quarter-century, and reducing illegal border-crossing from citizens of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by 85 percent, among other accomplishments.

Biden did the opposite. He demonstrated weakness early on with respect to China, whose leaders lectured Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Alaska on race relations. Biden also failed to hold Chinese Communist Party leaders accountable for possibly developing, and certainly spreading the virus around the world that has killed just short of 1 million Americans to date.

Similarly, Biden started up talks with Iran on re-entering the weak Obama nuclear deal that Trump scuttled while failing to add countries to the historic Abraham Accords with Israel. Perhaps most telling for Putin, Biden bungled the exit from Afghanistan, losing 13 of our bravest men and women in uniform in the process and turning over the country to the Taliban, this time armed with some $80 billion of lethal NATO-supplied military equipment, and failing to hold anyone accountable for that debacle.

With Putin himself, Biden gave in on completing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany that Trump had blocked, and Biden asked for nothing in return.

Now, two months into Putin’s second invasion of Ukraine in eight years, it is important to remember that Biden’s weakness on national security gave a green light to the Russian leader’s longtime ambitions for further military action in Ukraine that he held in check for four years under Biden’s immediate predecessor. In the wake of Blinken and Austin meeting with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president should bear in mind what, and who, set the stage for where we stand today.

Mr. Ullyot served as deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs and National Security Council spokesman, 2019-21. Mr. Grant served as senior adviser for strategic planning in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, 2019-21, and is author of “Aggression Against Ukraine: Territory, Responsibility, and International Law.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/26/joe-bidens-weakness-encouraged-putins-invasion-of-ukraine/,2022-04-26
Biden Is Openly Pursuing A Policy Of Escalation In Ukraine,"What are we to make of a comment Monday from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that the Biden administration’s goal in Ukraine is “to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine”?

Austin made the remark in a press conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken after the pair met with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, in what was the highest level visit by U.S. officials since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.

One obvious conclusion we can draw from Austin’s comment is that the Biden administration has now committed openly to a policy of escalation in Ukraine. The White House intends to keep the war in Ukraine alive, with the stated goal of weakening Moscow by continuing to pour new and more advanced weaponry into the war-ravaged country.

Indeed, Austin and Blinken announced a new round of military aid to Ukraine, bringing the total amount of U.S. assistance to about $3.7 billion since the invasion began. After resisting pressure early in the conflict to supply Ukraine with advanced weapons systems, the Biden administration has changed course. It is now preparing to send heavy artillery, helicopters, armored personnel carriers, antiaircraft radar systems, advanced attack drones and other weapons.

Austin told members of the press that the Defense Department won’t just send weapons, but “will expand military training for Ukrainian service members in the region on certain weapons systems being provided.”

Delivering all this aid is of course itself an escalation of U.S. involvement in the war. A Wall Street Journal report about the meeting in Kyiv included this detail, buried near the end of the story: “Senior U.S. military officers at a facility in Poland described an accelerating logistical network for supplying weapons and materiel to Ukraine, as well as a regional effort to increase troop levels and exercises with NATO members along the alliance’s eastern flank.

“Seven 155-mm artillery pieces, along with their tow vehicles, are being processed through the facility, adding to the 18 howitzers the U.S. has already provided to Ukraine, a senior defense official said. Six dozen U.S. howitzers are being sent to Ukraine under a new aid package, and rounds of 155-mm artillery were visible on pallets at the Polish facility.”

These weapons and munitions are getting into Ukraine for the most part via railway, which is probably why Russia carried out missile strikes on least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine early Monday, just hours after Austin and Blinken met with Zelensky.

How did Austin and Blinken get to that meeting? By railway. Politico reported that “Austin and Blinken traveled to and from Kyiv by train and crossed into Poland shortly before Russian missiles struck several railway lines — including one in the city of Lviv in western Ukraine, near the Polish border.”

If you’re wondering what is the significance of this deepening U.S. involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war, or how it might lead to a direct military confrontation between the United States and Russia, consider that the U.S. secretaries of defense and state might have just narrowly missed being struck by a Russian missile as they traveled to and from Kyiv by rail on Monday.

As the Biden administration escalates, the chances that something very much like that will happen are going to increase exponentially. Perhaps a crew of U.S. servicemen quietly sent into the country to train Ukrainian troops on the use of a new U.S.-provided weapons systems will get hit by a Russian missile strike. Perhaps U.S. diplomats, whom Blinken said are returning to Ukraine this week, first to Lviv and eventually to Kyiv, will be killed or injured or otherwise caught in the crossfire.

We can’t know what will happen exactly, only that if the United States continues down this path — sending Ukraine increasingly advanced weapons systems, training Ukrainian troops, underwriting Ukraine’s defense — it will lead, as it has already led, to ever-increasing U.S. involvement in the war.

At some point, it won’t matter that back in March President Biden said he wouldn’t send U.S. troops to Ukraine. The logic of U.S. escalation is already at work, moving us toward direct engagement.

After all, the Pentagon said in early March that a U.S.-facilitated transfer of Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine was not “tenable,” yet last week the United States and its allies took a step in that direction, providing Ukraine with aircraft parts it needed to get 20 grounded planes operational. Even now, Slovakia is in talks with its NATO allies about providing MiG-29 warplanes to Ukraine if the United States will replace them with F-16s.

Beyond the logic of escalation, there is a strategic dead-end looming for the Biden administration. Early on in the war, Blinken articulated the hoped-for end state in Ukraine: “We have to sustain this until it stops, until the war is over, Russian forces leave, the Ukrainian people regain their independence, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity. We’re committed to doing that.”

The best way to understand that is as a maximalist policy vis-à-vis Moscow: a total defeat of Moscow and a complete humiliation of the Russian armed forces. Since Blinken said that in early March, versions of it have been repeated in the corporate press and among unreconstructed foreign policy neocons.

A recent column by Daniel Henninger in the Wall Street Journal is representative of this view. The time has come, he says, for the West to declare its intention to “win” in Ukraine. After all, America’s “credibility” is at stake. “The moment has arrived in this war for Mr. Biden to clear something up with one presidential assertion: ‘We’re in this thing to win.’”

So goes the thinking among establishment types inside the Beltway. As far as they are concerned, the United States is “in this thing.” And if we’re in, then we’d better win. The assumption underlying this analysis is that Russian President Vladimir Putin, faced with U.S. escalation, will back down and accept defeat. An unmitigated Ukrainian victory is, according to these people, somehow a realistic outcome of this conflict.

But history, especially the unique history of Russo-Ukrainian relations, suggests otherwise. Indeed it suggests that Moscow will never allow for the kind of Ukrainian victory that Blinken and the White House are working towards. To the extent U.S. policymakers are relying on, say, historical comparisons to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan as a guide for the creation of U.S. policy in Ukraine, then we’re in trouble.

Put another way, this is not a peripheral conflict for Russia. As far as the Kremlin is concerned, the fate of Ukraine is inextricably tied to Russia’s core strategic national interests. The chances that Putin will accept total defeat in Ukraine without escalation that involves the use of nuclear weapons, or that involves widening the war, are probably lower than most Americans are comfortable with.

To bring it back to Defense Secretary Austin’s remark about the U.S. wanting to see Russia “weakened” to the point it cannot field a military capable of invading a much smaller country, one has to ask: how does Russia, a country with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, get weakened to that point? Do Austin and his generals really think that a U.S.-backed Ukraine is going to be able to do that? Or do they have something else in mind? The evidence suggests they have something else in mind, and that something else is direct U.S. and NATO involvement.

Instead of barreling toward a clash between Russia and the West, a wiser course of action for the Biden administration would be to ensure the United States doesn’t get drawn into the war at all, and takes the lead in urging both sides to come to a negotiated political settlement that puts an end to the fighting.

But with each passing week, that wiser course of action becomes more remote and less possible, while a far more dangerous and increasingly inexorable course of events, for the United States and Russia and the entire world, draws ever closer.

If Only Americans Could Be As Patriotic As The Left Is About Ukraine,"In increasingly deep blue Northern Virginia, the outlandish virtue-signaling of support for Ukraine has reached a fever pitch. There are pro-Ukraine bumper stickers, pro-Ukraine lanyards and ribbons, and pro-Ukraine lawn flags.

One guy in my neighborhood has installed a ribbon of blue and yellow lights around his garage. Yet however silly the tokenism by managerial elites with no real stake in war, one must admit the reality of a Ukrainian patriotism that has coalesced since Russia invaded on 24 February.

Ukrainian civilians by the thousands have taken up arms to fight Russian soldiers. Citizens have helped destroy Russian supply lines, fuel, food, and ammunition. Hundreds of Ukrainians across the world have returned to fight for their country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offers nightly addresses to the Ukrainian people that have bolstered morale and a shared sense of national identity.

Now of course some of this is Ukrainian propaganda. The soldiers on Snake Island who cursed their Russian attackers didn’t actually die, but were captured. The “Ghost of Kyiv” was likely a myth. And, concernedly, some of the fighters defending the besieged city of Mariupol appear to be members of the Azov Battalion, which uses Neo-Nazi symbols (ironic, given that Zelensky is Jewish and so are perhaps more than 100,000 Ukrainians).

Nevertheless, one cannot deny the reality of a shared Ukrainian patriotism and its effect not only on the people of Ukraine but the world. It’s even inspired some enough to say that perhaps not all nationalism is bad.

This, despite the fact that Ukraine took a “patriarchal” and “anti-female” stance on conscription, banning nearly all men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country. Ukrainian men have in fact overwhelmingly been the leaders during this crisis. (This is something, bizarrely, Western feminists have decried as perpetuating unjust “gender systems”).

Much of what makes the Ukrainians’ defense of their homeland inspiring is that it is theirs as a unique people. Pace Vladimir Putin’s comments that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people,” the Ukrainians have a unique culture, which, though it often overlaps with that of their Russian neighbors, is decidedly their own.

Ukranians speak their own language, possess their own customs and cuisine, and are members of their own church. Although their history is intimately tied to that of Russia, it is also their own, with its own heroes and tragedies. Also, as Ukrainians well know, Soviet Russia is to blame for much Ukrainian suffering, such as the 1930s government-caused famine during Communist Joseph Stalin’s regime that killed almost 4 million Ukrainians.

Celebrate American Patriotism as Much As Ukranian Patriotism

Might there perhaps be a lesson for the United States in Ukraine’s resurgent patriotism? I would say yes. The war in Ukraine should crystallize what’s at stake in our own nation’s recent fights over our national identity. For the very things that have united Ukrainians against an external aggressor are what our nation’s ruling class institutions seem most eager to dismantle.

Perhaps most egregious is the proliferation of a revisionist history of America as a systemically racist, unjust society that oppresses “persons of color.” (We might note that this theme is one the Soviets also sought to push with their propaganda throughout the Cold War.)

The popular 1619 Project has claimed that our nation’s true founding can be traced not to the Plymouth Bay Colony in Massachusetts, but the purchase of slaves at Point Comfort, Virginia. It further fallaciously claims that the American Revolution was not a battle to preserve colonists’ natural rights and institute a republic built on eternal truths about man, but to perpetuate the institution of chattel slavery.

Likewise the proliferation of critical race theory across our education institutions, corporations, and government bureaucracies, teaching that all human interactions must be interpreted primarily through the lens of race and racism to reverse historical injustices.

That is not all. Activists from Black Lives Matter to many pundits aim to undermine the nuclear family and parental rights. “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,” said former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year — and many on the left came to his defense.

The recent dustup over anti-grooming bills further exposes how entrenched liberal institutions are in their desire to influence the next generation with aggressive, abnormal sexual ideology that can leave permanent scars. Much the same can be said for the left’s catechesis of “global citizenship,” which vitiates responsibility for republican government, or its legal and cultural attacks against conservative religious institutions, which aim to undermine what influence they retain over some parts of the country.

Another Warning, From France

France just had its presidential election and once more chose liberal Emmanuel Macron. That is instructive here, for the French are farther along in the self-imposed destruction of a national identity.

French writer Alexandre Goodarzy speaks to this in his recent book “Kidnapped in Iraq,” which is not only the story of his harrowing experiences in the Middle East, but an indictment of milquetoast French culture. “We no longer believed in anything, especially not in ourselves,” he writes. He continues:

There was not a day without repentance: public and widespread apologies for being who and what we were, and for the so-called crimes of the generations of our people who had come before us. This included repentance for being French, for being white, for having colonized countries…. We all had to lower our heads and castigate ourselves.

Goodarzy ends his tale — which included 10 weeks of captivity by Islamic militants in Iraq — by warning that France has become soft, its people no longer proud enough to do the “manual labor, garbage-collecting, building, cleaning, and sweeping that kept our country running.” He warns that the French secular republic is not strong enough to “face aggressive Islamism,” that it lacks a foundation with enough meaning and purpose to defend itself. (More than 10 percent of France is Muslim, and many embrace radical strands of Islam.)

In other words, America’s self-hatred and radical social engineering are not far behind France’s. Goodarzy is worried about his people, who suffer increasingly violent attacks at the hands of native-born Muslim extremists. They seem incapable, and perhaps unwilling, to address what’s really at stake: a nation collapsing in on itself because of a lack of identity and sense of purpose.

If America wants to avoid the fate that awaits the French — a threat from both within and without — we need to start thinking more like the Ukrainian patriots who know what their country means and are willing to fight and die for it. And that doesn’t mean putting up pro-Ukraine bumper stickers or blue-and-yellow ribbons.

J.D. Vance And The New Right Are Racking Up Wins Amid Backstabbing,"“What is conservative?” columnist Bret Stephens asked in Tuesday’s New York Times.

“It is,” he posits, “above all, the conviction that abrupt and profound changes to established laws and common expectations are utterly destructive to respect for the law and the institutions established to uphold it — especially when those changes are instigated from above, with neither democratic consent nor broad consensus.”

Stephens was responding to the broad conservative and Christian excitement that America’s extreme abortion regime might finally be struck down by the Supreme Court; but Stephens might as well have been writing about J.D. Vance’s hard-fought Tuesday night victory in Ohio’s Republican primary. Or Blake Master’s primary race to represent Arizona. Or Tucker Carlson’s intellectual ascendancy. Or the rise of a young and invigorated American New Right.

Stephens is wrong, of course. Conservatism isn’t remotely about process: It’s about traditional wisdom and values; it’s about conserving things of generational, transcendent value.

It means understanding that man is fallen, and society must protect families, workers, traditions, and, yes, the unborn from being wiped aside; oppressed from above.

It means conserving the truth — the truth about men and women, the truth about the unborn, the truth about human equality, and the necessary limits on government power.

That’s not to say there isn’t still an important place for process: In a civilization governed by prudent and benevolent institutions that buttress and strengthen traditional wisdom and values, process protects those cherished things from rapid change.

In a world governed by imprudent and vindictive institutions, however, that claw, gnash, and tear at traditional wisdom — that usurp traditional values — the “process” merely fools us into believing that what these institutions are doing is normal, when in reality it is profoundly abnormal.

In the September 1961 issue of Young Americans for Freedom’s New Guard magazine, a young M. Stanton Evans asked, “Can a conservative be a radical?” Yes, he concluded: “Confronted with an established revolution, the conservative must seek to change the status quo; he has no other means of affirming his tradition.”

Vance understands this. That is why, Axios’s Jonathan Swan and Lachlan Markay report, “The Republican establishment privately regards [him] with the same disgust many felt toward Donald Trump when he entered the White House on Jan. 20, 2017.”

It’s why Senate Minority Whip John Thune looked forward to reading the coverage of Vance’s loss.

It’s why one “senior Republican aide told The Hill 70 percent of Senate Republicans share that sentiment.”

The reality is, they should all fear Vance. He’s a man who doesn’t “care if Google is a private company, because they have too much power; and if you want to have a country where people can live their lives freely, you have to be concerned about power — whether it’s concentrated in the government or concentrated in big corporations.”

He thinks our corporate overlords would happily satiate us with whirling gizmos and gadgets while capturing our culture and selling us out to China. This places him directly at odds with tired, established Republicanism, which would prefer to slander the ghost of Ronald Reagan while they simp for corporations that work to undermine our national economy, our traditions, our families, and even our children’s sexuality.

Vance is also a man who doesn’t “really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” and thinks “it’s ridiculous that we are focused on” their border over our own.

Far more than Ukraine, he cares “about the fact that in [his] community right now, the leading cause of death among 18- to 45-year-olds is Mexican fentanyl.” This places him directly at odds with all of established Washington, where $5 billion for our country’s border security is too much to ask, but politicians crow about sending six times that amount to defend the sacred territorial integrity of another’s.

Vance is a man who thinks, “If any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.”

“So much of what we want to accomplish,” he recognizes, is “…fundamentally dependent on going through a set of very hostile institutions, specifically the universities, which control the knowledge in our society, which control what we call truth and what we call falsity, that provides research that gives credibility to some of the most ridiculous ideas that exist in our country.”

This once again places him directly at odds with Washington, which every years sends billions in federal aid to colleges and universities, with nary a whimper of a fight.

More broadly, “Vance,” Harpers editor James Pogue writes, “believes that a well-educated and culturally liberal American elite has greatly benefited from globalization, the financialization of our economy, and the growing power of big tech.”

“This,” he continues, “has led an Ivy League intellectual and management class… to adopt a set of economic and cultural interests that directly oppose those of people in places like Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up.”

In other words, Vance knows what time it is.

Cracks In The Wall

He’s joined in this understanding by Blake Masters, another New Right candidate for Senate who Republican leadership would rather see lose his primary.

They’re joined by Tucker Carlson, whose influence over the New Right was enough to trigger The New York Times into putting 10,000 words, 1,150 hours of television-watching, nine reporters, and three pieces toward taking him out.

They’re joined by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose fights with teachers and corporate America have earned him the ire of process-loving conservatives.

They’re joined by the broader American New Right rising across the country.

And there are signs that together, we’re beginning to earn wins: that the rock of the permanent, institutional left-wing-revolution is showing cracks. In the past month alone, we’ve seen a bellwether American state choose an outspent New Right candidate to run for Senate, adding a young face and new voice to conservative leadership.

We’ve seen elected politicians in Florida stand up and say, no, you won’t get corporate carve-outs and perks, and use those to attack the parents and children of our state without consequence.

We’ve seen the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, pick a fight with the entire ruling class, causing them to get so angry they exposed how anti-free speech they really were — and then winning the fight to control Twitter.

We’ve seen The New York Times’ full-body blow on a New Right cable host land as impotently as a limp-wristed pat.

We’ve seen CNN Plus put down, with Chris Wallace finally (if only temporarily) off TV; his lasting legacy reduced to the Republican Party withdrawing from the liberal-dominated Commission on Presidential Debates.

We’ve seen a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court imply that finally — after a half century of political dodging and hiding — the Supreme Court might strike down Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood.

And we’ve seen Senate leaders sit silently, or chuckle along with reporters, as they anticipate the New Right’s failings. We’ve seen columnists like Stephens complain that curtailing one of the world’s most barbarous abortion regimes “would be a radical, not conservative, choice.”

That’s not surprising, though. These men aren’t actually conservatives: they’re simple institutionalists. And in an age where America’s institutions — her colleges and universities, corporate media, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, hospitals and medical associations, Pentagon, Hollywood, children’s entertainment — are dominated by the left, their acquiescing makes them what M. Stanton Evans derisively called “silent partners in the work of destruction”; “silent partners” in the left’s permanent revolution.

In this moment, we don’t need silent partners: We need rebels willing to break the institutions of the left; to battle their champions in their own halls of power. We need men and women willing to fight for traditional wisdom and values; men and women who understand mankind is fallen, and that our elected leaders must protect families, workers, traditions and the unborn.

In an age where our institutions have become so used to living in the dark that they hate the light, we need men and women who are willing to fight for the truth.

In America today, we need radicals.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/05/j-d-vance-and-the-new-right-are-racking-up-wins-while-the-establishment-stabs-at-their-backs/,2022-05-05
"By Giving Ukraine Real-Time Targets, U.S. Risks Stumbling Into War","The New York Times claimed this week that the United States is providing real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine that has enabled the Ukrainians to target and kill approximately a dozen Russian generals, and helped locate and strike the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet last month.

Described as a “classified effort,” the U.S. provision of targeting intelligence to Ukraine “also includes anticipated Russian troop movements gleaned from recent American assessments of Moscow’s secret battle plan for the fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine,” according to the Times.

The Times’ reporting relies on anonymous “senior American officials,” but if true it represents a sharp and unprecedented escalation of U.S. involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war, such that Congress should immediately debate and vote on whether to authorize the use of military force in Ukraine.

Indeed, providing real-time targeting intelligence brings the United States right up to the line of belligerence, and arguably over it. The Biden administration seems to understand this. According to the Times, the administration “has sought to keep much of the battlefield intelligence secret, out of fear it will be seen as an escalation and provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a wider war.”

The White House is right to fear this outcome, because it’s entirely possible that Putin will absolutely consider this level of battlefield participation by the United States tantamount to an act of war. That’s no doubt why the Biden administration snapped into damage control mode after the Times story about targeting intelligence published on Wednesday.

Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, criticized the Times’ headline and said in a statement that battlefield intelligence was not provided to the Ukrainians “with the intent to kill Russian generals.” Asked about the Times report on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby echoed Watson: “We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military.”

Then on Thursday evening, a second Times story dropped, again sourced to anonymous senior administration officials, detailing how U.S. intelligence helped Ukraine confirm the location of the Russian flagship Moskva, which on April 13 was hit by Ukrainian forces on the ground with two Neptune missiles and eventually sank. The Moskva is the largest warship sunk since World War Two, and a significant loss for the Russian Navy. Some U.S. officials cited by the Times said the American intelligence was “crucial” to the sinking of the Moskva.

The news coincides with reports earlier this week that Russia’s highest-ranking general and chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, was wounded while visiting the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. (According to the Times, the strike that wounded Gerasimov was conducted without the aid of U.S. intelligence.)

In addition to intelligence sharing, the United States is now providing Ukraine with new and better weapons, including heavy artillery, state-of-the-art tactical drones, and armored vehicles. And that’s just for starters. Last week President Biden asked Congress to authorize $33 billion in weapons funding for Ukraine, on top of the billions we’ve already provided. If the past few months are any indication, as the war drags on we will furnish Ukraine with increasingly advanced (and expensive) weaponry and weapons systems.

It’s time to have a debate about all this in Congress, so the representatives of the American people can at least have a say in the matter before we stumble into war with Russia over Ukraine.

Why? Because the news we might be giving Ukraine real-time Russian targets on the battlefield isn’t some trifling or technical thing. It’s a major development — and potentially a major step toward war. It’s true that the United States has been sharing intelligence with Ukraine since before Russia’s invasion on February 24, and indeed was sharing intelligence with allies in the runup to the invasion, but nothing close to what is described by the Times.

To understand the degree of U.S. escalation the Times report would suggest, a little background is in order. In early March, there appeared to be some confusion among Democrats on the question of intelligence sharing. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the United States was “providing some intelligence” but not “real-time targeting.”

Asked about this later, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki implied that Smith was wrong, saying the United States was providing the Ukrainians “timely intelligence” that “includes information that should help them inform and develop their military response to Russia’s invasion.” When Politico’s NatSec Daily tweeted this, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, replied on Twitter that Psaki’s answer was “truthy,” but that “it does not capture the full reality.”

What did Rubio mean? The most likely scenario is that the United States was providing battlefield intelligence to the Ukrainians with built-in latency, a delay of 20 or 30 minutes — enough to plausibly deny that we were actively helping Ukraine target Russian troops and thus avoid getting drawn into the war.

But if the Times report is accurate, we’ve gotten rid of that latency, with huge implications for the U.S. role in the conflict. The Times report goes on to say that “U.S. intelligence support to the Ukrainians has had a decisive effect on the battlefield, confirming targets identified by the Ukrainian military and pointing it to new targets. The flow of actionable intelligence on the movement of Russian troops that America has given Ukraine has few precedents.”

A level of intelligence-sharing that has few precedents might well have huge consequences. As a thought experiment, imagine that during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 we discovered that Moscow was relaying real-time battlefield intelligence about U.S. troop movements to Saddam Hussein’s Republican Guard, and that as a result of this intelligence a number of U.S. units and commanders had been taken out.

Would U.S. leaders have said nothing and done nothing? Let it go with a strongly worded statement? Probably not. There probably would have been some form of retaliation on our part.

Likewise, if U.S. involvement in this war continues to escalate — and especially if the United States continues to give the Ukrainians battlefield targets in real-time — we should expect and prepare for some kind of retaliation by Moscow.

In the meantime, it’s not too much to ask that Congress, as representatives of the American people, debate and vote on whether to authorize a U.S. march to war that’s now well underway.

Russia’s Annual ‘Victory Day’ Celebration Takes On A Different Meaning This Year,"On Monday, May 9, Russia will hold its annual celebration marking the defeat of Germany in World War Two. Since 1945, Moscow has hosted a grand military parade in Red Square with dignitaries reviewing the troops from atop the mausoleum than contains Vladimir Lenin’s tomb.

During the long twilight of the Cold War, there was an entire sub-branch of Kremlinology dedicated to analyzing who was invited onto the mausoleum, with its top tier having room for about 20 people. This will be the first Victory Day Parade ever to see Russia involved in a conventional war in Europe, hence, the symbolism of who is, or is not, on the mausoleum may take on greater significance.

Adding further intrigue are reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to soon undergo cancer surgery, temporarily transferring power to Nikolai Patrushev, a former intelligence and security officer who serves as Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. Patrushev is said to be even more ruthless than Putin.

For the past nine years, General of the Army Sergey Shoygu has presided as the parade inspector. For eight of those years, General of the Army Oleg Salyukov has been the parade commander. Will either reprise their roles, given the crippling corruption and incompetence hobbling the Russian military that occurred under their watch?

Of note, General Valery Gerasimov was the parade’s commander from 2009 to 2012. Putin ordered Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, to personally take command of Russia’s renewed offensive to the north of the Donbas Basin in Ukraine’s east, He arrived in the region on April 27. Reports suggest he was wounded in the leg on May 1 by a Ukrainian artillery strike.

But Russia’s war against Ukraine has not gone according to plan. The initial attempt to topple the government in Kyiv in the days after the Feb. 24 invasion failed. Expectations for a quick victory were built on a wobbly three-legged stool.

The first leg was Putin’s own extensively prepared claim that Ukraine isn’t a real nation and that it’s always been a part of Russia. The second leg was Russia’s relatively easy victory in 2014 in Crimea and in the eastern majority ethnic Russian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk at a time when Ukraine’s pro-Russian president had neglected the armed forces, leaving the nation largely defenseless. The third leg of this now broken stool was built from Gerasimov’s theories on modern so-called “hybrid warfare.”

In speeches and papers, Gen. Gerasimov suggested that successful Russian operations achieve information and psychological dominance over the enemy. To do this, chaos must be sown in the initial period of war — even before the first kinetic shots are fired. This can only be done by ignoring the traditional lines between war and peace, and politics and war. Further, and this is important to Western nations that are now finally sending Ukraine the military equipment, ammunition, and spare parts needed to fight, is the fact that hybrid warfare sees the synergy of chaos (nonlinear and nonmilitary tactics) as no longer merely supporting of conventional force, but equivalent to it.

Thus, the widely reported Russian and Chinese cyber-attack on Ukrainian networks initiated before formal hostilities were a form of chaos-seeding, as well as aggressive exploitation of social media to spread false reports and undermine Ukraine’s standing with Western democracies.

That these hybrid tactics weren’t enough to win on the cheap doesn’t mean that they don’t have value. It simply means that Ukraine, having had a near-death experience in 2014, reformed and upgraded its defenses. Regeneration is an advantage held by representative governments such as Ukraine over security states like Russia. Even imperfect representative governments are more adaptable than the most perfect of security states.

So, Putin is said to need cancer surgery, Gerasimov is wounded, and Russia’s war on Ukraine is faltering. As I look at the situation — more as a former elected lawmaker than as a retired intelligence officer — here are the things I’ll be watching.

First, is Putin truly ill, and will he go under the knife? For such a powerful, paranoid man with many enemies who likely ordered the assassinations of scores of opponents and dissidents, this decision must weigh heavily. Who can be trusted? While he is vulnerable, any one of a number of people could kill him — including Nikolai Patrushev himself.

But the claimed illness brings an upside to Putin. Putin took personal command of the war in late April, handing domestic authority over to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. Putin’s direct involvement in a war that hasn’t panned out, though Russia is firing more long-range missiles deep into Ukraine, means “cancer” could be a graceful exit or a way to salvage a reputation and a retirement. For Putin, the war might be over, though not likely the war itself.

Russians place great significance on special dates, and few dates are more special than May 9. Not long ago it was suggested that Russia’s retooled offensive against Ukraine in the east and the south might have borne enough fruit by May 9 to declare victory, real or symbolic. Those thoughts have sailed through the air like a Russian tank’s turret, landing with a thud in muddy, bloody reality. Thus, this Victory Day Parade will be devoid of triumph.

Americans Don't Want War With Russia But Republicans And Democrats Are Forcing It,"Since the conflict in Ukraine and Russia began, high-profile elites have demanded that the United States back Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky with finances, food, weaponry, and even the threat of war against Vladimir Putin, but this is out of step with the will of the people.

What started as a call to fund and defend a nation against an invasion from a dangerous dictator, however, quickly morphed into a quest to undermine the Russian regime by whatever means necessary including ordering NATO warplanes to shoot down Russian aircraft and issuing full-blown declarations of war.

A majority of Americans do not want the U.S. to go to war with Russia over Ukraine. Recent polling from The Washington Post and ABC News suggests that 72 percent of U.S. adults “oppose the United States taking direct military action against Russian forces.” Even in the early days of the overseas conflict, only 17 percent of Americans were willing to “risk a direct war between the U.S. and Russia” to “do whatever it can to help Ukraine.”

Congress has yet to vote to officially authorize acts of war against Russia, but that hasn’t stopped some of the most high-ranking officials in the U.S., from President Joe Biden and sitting members of Congress to intelligence agencies and even institutions such as the corporate media, from promoting a clash in Eastern Europe.

Just this week, sitting Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., admitted that the United States is in a proxy war with Russia.

“At the end of the day, we’ve got to realize we’re at war. And we’re not just at war to support the Ukrainians. We’re fundamentally at war, although, it’s somewhat through proxy with Russia and it’s important that we win,” Moulton said.

Similarly, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., claimed this week that “we can win this war on behalf of Ukraine.”

“There is no off-ramp in this war. Somebody is going to win and somebody is going to lose, and I hope and pray and do everything in my power to make sure Ukraine wins,” Graham said.

Graham’s march toward war has significantly increased in the last few months. In March, he called for the assassination of Putin by Russians to end the conflict.

“The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,” Graham tweeted.

Now he says it’s up to the U.S. to fight for Ukraine and other nations such as Taiwan, which faces a threat of invasion from China.

Even though some legislators haven’t engaged in the same kind of reckless rhetoric to promote war with Putin, they have fed into the escalation narrative by voting to forward the nation’s role in the conflict. On Tuesday, just weeks after authorizing $13.6 billion of aid money to Ukraine, the House of Representatives voted to send nearly $40 billion more to the Eastern European country.

Only 57 House Republicans and no Democrats voted against the spending package, which lacked regulation and specification.

So far, neither Biden nor the Republicans or Democrats in Congress have laid out a peace plan or spending limits for Ukraine. Instead, they’ve used reckless rhetoric to escalate U.S. involvement and explicitly signaled their intent to take down a nuclear power against voters’ desires.

Congress Could Double Homeland Defense Budget With $40B For Ukraine,"The $40 billion package that the U.S. House of Representatives just voted Tuesday to send to Ukraine could have nearly doubled the budget for our own Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement combined.

With just 57 votes in opposition, 368 representatives across the political spectrum voted to send almost $40 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars to Ukraine, within hours of the bill’s text being released. It’s more than the $33 billion previously requested by President Joe Biden, and an increase in federal spending amid a time of record inflation, federal deficits, and congressional failure to pass regular U.S. budgets.

The bill was quickly sent to the Senate, where South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who previously called for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaled this might be the first of many such spending sprees for foreign interests, saying “Do I think this will be the last round? No, I think we’ll be doing this again.”

It’s certainly understandable that many members of Congress want to help freedom-loving people in Ukraine. In a vacuum, with unlimited taxpayer money, it might be a good thing to do.

But in rushing to spend other people’s money so Congress can feel like heroes, they’re ignoring the crises upon crises plaguing their own constituents, while failing to even ensure that the billions of dollars in aid are spent judiciously. Meanwhile, rampant inflation at 40-year highs is squeezing Americans’ wallets, while our government is failing to keep our own borders secure from illegal border-crossers and a drug invasion killing Americans in record numbers.

As Rep. Greg Steube, a Republican from Florida, summarized, “less than 6 hours before a vote, the Democrats dropped a massive, last-minute bill to send $40 billion more without any safeguards, assurances of use, or proof of a strategic plan for the U.S. role in Ukraine.”

“I voted in April to approve a loan of U.S. military equipment to Ukraine and voted in March for $14 billion in military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine,” he noted. “Since then, Congress has not received a single report on how much of this funding was spent, if any, nor assurances that the funding even reached Ukraine.”

Even CNN admitted, “What happens to weapons sent to Ukraine? The US doesn’t really know,” before hand-waving the question with the absurd explanation that “It’s a conscious risk the Biden administration is willing to take.”

Steube also pointed out that the $40 billion from American taxpayers poised to go to Ukraine could almost double what we spend on the four main services responsible for homeland defense.

While the Department of Homeland Security budget for fiscal year 2022 was roughly $90.8 billion, more than 30 percent of that went to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). After subtracting smaller agencies like the U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the budget devotes $46.6 billion to the Coast Guard, TSA, ICE, and CBP combined — just barely a higher number than the money Congress is rushing to send overseas with one of likely multiple foreign war spending packages.

Of that figure, the Coast Guard receives about $13 billion, TSA gets about $9 billion, ICE gets about $8 billion, and CBP gets about $16 billion. It’s not hard to imagine the impact that doubling those numbers would have on securing our porous southern border and choking the influx of deadly drugs that pour into our country.

Instead, the party in power (joined by many Republicans) refuses to meaningfully address their growing crises, staging a virtue-signaling display of rushing U.S. money off to Ukraine without taking care to ensure it falls into the proper hands for proper use. And if that wasn’t enough, their accompanying rhetoric may drag Americans into a war we don’t want with a nuclear power while Communist China’s rise continues unchecked.

Why Doesn't Hong Kong's Tragic Loss Get As Much Attention As Ukraine?,"Hong Kong “elected” a new chief while the world wasn’t paying attention.

Hong Kong’s current chief Carrie Lam will retire at the end of June. The selection of her successor has followed the rules Beijing dictated since it took control of Hong Kong in 1997. Beijing stamped out any hope of universal suffrage in Hong Kong in 2004.

Rather than letting more than 7 million residents in Hong Kong have a say in whom the city’s chief should be, Beijing created a “nomi­nating committee” (which has more than 1,400 members today), the majority of which are pro-Beijing elites. The committee would “vote” for a candidate from a list of candidates approved by Beijing. Beijing has ensured that Hong Kong’s chief executive will always be its puppet through this arrangement.

In previous “selections,” Beijing usually approved two or three candidates for the nominating committee to choose from, giving an illusion of an “election” even though the committee knew which candidate Beijing preferred. This year, Beijing dropped all pretense, so John Lee was the only candidate on the ballot.

Lee served as Hong Kong’s security chief under Lam’s administration. He helped Beijing crack down on the city’s pro-democracy movement and enforced the draconian National Security Law.

The National Security Law criminalizes any act of so-called secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements, with a maximum penalty of life in prison. The National Security Law also gives Beijing unprecedented extraterritorial power to punish anyone anywhere in the world for advocating for democracy in Hong Kong.

Evidence that Democracy Has Already Died

Lee’s hard-line approach didn’t win him much public support. According to polls before last Sunday, Lee’s approval rating was only 35 percent. He probably would have had little chance of becoming the city’s chief had a general election been held.

However, with Beijing’s blessing, 1,416 out of the 1,428 members of the nominating committee “voted” for Lee. This means Lee will become Hong Kong’s new chief executive by winning 99 percent of the ballots cast. Such irony has demonstrated how pathetic the Beijing-sanctioned “selection” process is.

Another irony about Lee’s “election” is that he will be the first Hong Kong chief under U.S. sanctions long before his term begins. In August 2020, the Trump administration imposed economic sanctions against a dozen Hong Kong officials, including Lee and Hong Kong’s current chief Carrie Lam, for “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy after Beijing’s imposition in 2020 of the national-security law.”

These Hong Kong officials’ U.S. assets are frozen and U.S. persons and companies are banned from commercial transactions with them. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief, called Lee’s selection as Hong Kong’s chief “yet another step in the dismantling of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.”

National Security Law Silences Journalists

Unfortunately, the selection of Lee is hardly the only bad news out of Hong Kong. Reporters without Borders recently released the 2022 edition of the World Press Freedom Index, which assesses the state of journalism in 180 countries and territories.

When this index was first established in 2002, Hong Kong ranked 18. Twenty years later, Hong Kong’s press freedom score has dropped to 148 out of 180, only slightly better than Communist China’s 175 out of 180. Calling Hong Kong once “a bastion of press freedom,” RSF said the city had seen “an unprecedented setback since 2020 when Beijing adopted a National Security Law aimed at silencing independent voices.”

According to RSF, examples of Hong Kong’s deterioration of press freedom include the government’s forceful closure of two major independent local news outlets, Apple Daily and Standard News, in 2021 under the pretext of national security threats. In addition, “numerous smaller-scale media outlets ceased operations” due to increasing legal risks. Dozens of Hong Kong journalists and media personalities have been arrested for “national security” crimes since 2020, and some, including Apple Daily’s publisher Jimmy Lai, are still languishing in prison.

West’s Indifference

What’s sadder than Hong Kong’s demise as a free society is the silence and indifference from the rest of the world. While activists, corporations, and governments are taking a stand to help Ukraine preserve its democracy and resist Russia’s invasion, very few talk about Hong Kong’s worsening political environment. They have forgotten that Hong Kongers courageously fought for democracy in their city for more than two decades, including the famed “Umbrella Movement” in 2014 and the anti-extradition bill protests in 2019.

There are likely three reasons for this collective silence and indifference to Hong Kong’s deterioration. First, the draconian National Security Law and its broad applications have silenced many people, including those who live abroad, from expressing any support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and activists. People are understandably worried they may have to face the Chinese government’s harsh punishment if they speak up.

Second, the danger Ukraine faces is immediate and highly visual due to Russia’s invasion. Ukraine leaders such as Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky have gotten the world’s sympathy by framing Ukraine’s resistance to Russia as a historical fight for democracy.

Hong Kongers didn’t lose their political freedom overnight. It took more than two decades, and people outside of the city have been less alarmed by the gradual corrosion of residents’ liberty.

It is a typical “boiling the frog” syndrome, “the failure to accept, acknowledge, or act against a problematic situation that will gradually increase in severity until it reaches calamitous proportions.” Hong Kongers also have the misfortune that most of their city’s elites, including many government officials, are more willing to sell out the city for fame and fortune than to advocate for people’s political rights.

China Has Weaponized Its Economic Power

Third, foreign governments and businesses have avoided criticizing China over Hong Kong due to economic interests. It is easier to take a stand against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because Russia’s economy is no bigger than South Korea’s. Other than the energy sector, criticizing Putin or ceasing business operations in Russia hasn’t presented much economic sacrifice for many governments and businesses.

China is the world’s second-largest economy. Many foreign governments and businesses not only count on exporting their goods and services to China’s large consumer market but also rely on China for supplies, from clothes to toys, to solar panels and materials for batteries for electric vehicles. Communist China has long weaponized its economic power to compel foreign governments and businesses to bend their knees and compromise their democratic values. China’s approach is less bloody than Russia’s invasion but still presents a serious threat to democracy.

Hong Kong’s fall from being one of the freest places in the world to merely another city under the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule is one of the most tragic events in our lifetime. It’s no less devastating than Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. If the rest of the world truly cares about defending democratic values, they should speak up and take a stand for Hong Kong, the same way they do now for Ukraine.

A U.S. Policy Of 'Bleeding Russia' In Ukraine Is Reckless In The Extreme,"The New York Times on Wednesday published an op-ed by Tom Stevenson arguing what some of us have been arguing for a while now: the Biden administration is openly — and recklessly — pursuing a policy of escalation in Ukraine that represents a new and very dangerous phase in the war.

Stevenson, a journalist who reported from Ukraine in the opening weeks of the war, argues that initially the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rather straightforwardly, with supplies of arms to the Ukrainians and economic sanctions on Russia. But things have changed over the past month.

Now, instead of simply helping Ukraine stave off invasion and conquest, U.S. policy seems to have shifted into something else entirely: the permanent weakening of Russia at any cost. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said so explicitly after a clandestine visit to Ukraine with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken last month. After her own recent visit to Kyiv, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi characterized the war as a global struggle for democracy.

To back up these outlandish claims, the Biden administration has now proposed a $40 billion military aid package to Ukraine, quadruple what the United States has thus far given Ukraine since the outbreak of the war in late February. On top of that, it appears the U.S. military may be providing real-time battlefield targeting intelligence to the Ukrainians, arguably making the United States an active belligerent in the conflict.

All of this amounts to a major policy shift on the part of the United States, writes Stevenson: “Whereas once the primary Western objective was to defend against the invasion, it has become the permanent strategic attrition of Russia.” This shift, he adds, has “coincided with the abandonment of diplomatic efforts.”

So what possible strategic gain does bleeding Russia in Ukraine hold for the United States? The risks of pursuing such a policy are immense, including the possibility of nuclear war between the world’s top two nuclear powers. If the Biden administration has some overarching goal in mind, it has not bothered to tell the American people. Instead, we are trundling along the road to war as if every decision we make is simply a reaction to Russian aggression.

But in fact, the war itself has shifted dramatically since late February, and conditions now are arguably more favorable to a cease-fire and a negotiated political settlement than they were even a month ago. Having failed in its initial push on Kyiv in the northern part of the country amid fierce resistance from the Ukrainians, Russia has shifted its strategy, limiting its forces to the south and east of Ukraine in hopes of consolidating control of a much more limited territory.

But instead of recognizing this for the concession that it is and seizing the chance to persuade both sides to stop fighting and make a deal, the United States has responded by publicly calling for the weakening of Russia and committing an enormous amount of taxpayer dollars to arming Ukraine in what might otherwise be turning into a much more limited conflict in the eastern part of that country.

A cynic might conclude that the Biden administration doesn’t really want the fighting to stop and will gladly keep funding a proxy war with Russia, even as it denies that it is doing so. A cynic might also argue that U.S. policy in Ukraine now has very little to do with Ukraine and everything to do with Moscow, possibly even encompassing the dangerous fantasy of regime change in the Kremlin.

That is certainly the view of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who claimed this week that “we can win this war on behalf of Ukraine.” (Recall that Graham called for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin back in March.)

Indeed, Biden and the Democrats have largely been joined in their strategic folly by most Republicans. Only 57 GOP members of the House voted against the $40 billion aid package to Ukraine this week.

As things stand now, it’s not unreasonable to suppose a bipartisan consensus is emerging in Washington to expand the war and get the United States directly involved in it under the pretext that the battle for Donbas is, as Pelosi ludicrously claimed, “the frontier of freedom.” To quote Stevenson, “This is not just declamatory extravagance. It is reckless. The risks hardly need to be stated.”

"While Communist China Menaces, DC Is Still Acting Like It’s 1991","Can you imagine living in mortal fear of a 90-year-old man who preaches peace and love? If so, you know what it is like to be a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party. On Wednesday, communist authorities in Hong Kong arrested Cardinal Joseph Zen on a phony “national security” charge.

Zen’s immediate offense was his alleged involvement in a dissolved fund to defend those harmed by the ruthless crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. His real crime is his unwillingness to overlook Beijing’s broken promises about establishing democracy with universal suffrage in Hong Kong—a promise it made to get the former colony back from the gullible British.

I had the honor of meeting Zen in the early 2010s. Already technically retired at the time, he lived and spoke meekly. That is the irony of his arrest: he is not particularly political and has never called for the downfall of the Chinese government.

Pope John Paul II made Zen bishop of Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the incumbent Red Pope has given Zen no support and cut a deal with Beijing to give the Chinese government veto power over the appointment of church officials in China. The Vatican’s foreign ministry is almost as bad as the ruling elite in the USA in selling out to China under the guise that doing so will tame its aggressive government.

Despite having to fight a two-front war against both the Vatican and officials in Hong Kong, Zen has kept his cool reserve and determination. He refused to abandon his people as they took to the streets in an attempt to preserve the freedoms they had and seek the ones they were promised.

That calm persistence probably terrified Beijing the most. Zen will not be corrupted or bullied. Both he and Beijing know the final chapter on Hong Kong has not yet been written.

Zen now joins other persecuted pro-democracy figures like jailed publisher Jimmy Lai, the founder of the pro-freedom Apple Daily newspaper, which authorities shut down last year.

Why does any of this matter to the United States? While our bipartisan ruling elite clearly deny it judging by their actions, China is our foremost adversary in the world. Yes, Iran’s government has seen itself as being at war with America since it came to power in 1979, and political Islam, which drives violent jihad, has not gone away. But China with its large economy, military, and population, its advanced technology, and its deep penetration of the American economy, poses a critical threat.

Dissidents like Zen and Lai pose a serious political challenge to the Chinese government. If they didn’t, Beijing would not go to such great lengths to silence them.

Free ethnically Chinese societies like Singapore and Taiwan today and Hong Kong before the crackdown of the past three years also pose a threat. They expose the lie that is at the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy: that democracy is impossible for China and that the only alternative to communist rule is anarchy.

Washington should understand this reality and embrace it. Forget about promoting human rights in the abstract, which in recent years has become more about attempting to spread neoliberalism globally. That woke form of human rights advocacy, which now includes hanging rainbow flags on U.S. embassies and holding up arms sales to longtime allies, has put us at odds with important partners like the Arabian Gulf monarchies, Singapore, and Hungary. It has comforted truly repressive adversaries like China and Iran.

Instead, we should back the political forces that are causing the most concern to our Chinese adversaries. We need to give strong support to dissidents and governments standing up against Beijing and Tehran, not a woke version of the ComIntern.

Of course, Washington in its current political composition will do nothing of the sort. The House just voted to spend $40 billion more that we do not have on a war in Ukraine where no vital U.S. interests are at stake. Fifty-seven Republicans voted against the handout, but a majority of both parties in Washington still thinks it is 1991, where we are the sole superpower, have money to burn, and haven’t racked up an appalling string of foreign failures.

Democrats are hoping increasingly elusive success in Ukraine will cause people and governments around the world to forget the humiliating loss Joe Biden achieved in Afghanistan last summer. It’s anyone’s guess why Beltway Republicans are joining them.

It will take a new president to set things straight. We need a larger military in the Pacific, but nearly as important, we need a coherent and determined political warfare effort against the Chinese Communist Party. In devising one, we ought to take into consideration the brave men and women—and the governments—who terrify Beijing.

Spending Mindlessly On Ukraine Is A Threat To U.S. National Security,"Since its inception, the United States has been required to strike a balance between its role in global affairs and its interests at home. In a letter to New Hampshire senator and Federalist William Plumer, Thomas Jefferson noted that “I, however, place economy among the first and most important republican virtues, and public debt as the greatest of the dangers to be feared.”

Jefferson’s assessment is apt and is as relevant today as it was when it was penned in 1816. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has offered a stark reminder of the cruelties of war.

Although we sympathize with the resistance to Vladimir Putin’s invasion, we cannot bankrupt our country by becoming a belligerent in another foreign war. With a national debt exceeding 120 percent of gross national product, rampant inflation not seen since the 1980s, and significant supply chain disruptions, the United States must first secure its own economy before assisting foreign states.

The United States spent nearly $5 trillion in response to the outbreak of Covid-19, leading to some of the highest sustained levels of inflation in U.S. history. In March, inflation hit a 40-year high, with gasoline prices up 48 percent year-over-year and energy prices spiking by approximately 32 percent in the same span of time.

Food prices have increased by nearly 9 percent. Used vehicle prices are up 35 percent. One would be hard-pressed to find an American consumer who has not felt the pain of a deteriorating economy caused by massive federal spending.

Thoughtless government spending has not only jeopardized the economic well-being of individual Americans but has also exacerbated the existing threat of our exorbitant national debt. I have repeatedly stated that the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt. In the last two years alone, the United States has borrowed more money than at any time in its history.

When the Ukraine Supplement Appropriations Act of 2022 was introduced in the Senate, I offered an amendment requiring a known, effective, and independent inspector general to oversee how funds were spent. If the Senate were to adopt a measure borrowing $40 billion to support a foreign nation, then the American people at least deserve to know that their hard-earned dollars were put to good use. If there is one thing that we should learn from the war in Afghanistan, it is that the chaos of war provides excellent cover for those seeking to defraud American taxpayers.

If the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022 is adopted, the United States will have sent $60 billion to Ukraine since 2014. This amount is nearly ten times the $6.4 billion we spend on cancer research every year.

Prioritizing the interest of other nations over our own will not end well. The present assault on monetary discipline is untenable, and unless we end this fiscal insanity, a day of reckoning awaits us. Not only are we flirting with financial ruin, but we also risk inadvertently entering a war with another major power. President Biden’s call for regime change in Russia, coupled with Congress’s willingness to provide seemingly limitless aid to Ukraine, has made our final objective unclear.

Congress recently approved more than $14 billion in aid to Ukraine, and the United States has nearly emptied our armories of critical and costly weaponry to support Ukraine. If the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022, as currently drafted, is adopted, our total aid to Ukraine will almost equal Russia’s annual military spending. Most Americans, especially our veterans who have seen firsthand the consequences of endless wars and regime changes, oppose war with Russia and support a reduction in U.S military engagement.

In times like these, we would be well-advised to heed Jefferson’s wisdom and pursue a course of “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none.”

How U.S. Climate Extremists Are Funding Russia's Threats To The Globe,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is illuminating an ugly truth: the anti-fracking war on America’s energy security is being waged by well-funded, radical U.S. environmental groups, as well as interests tied directly to Vladimir Putin. For years, the U.S. government has investigated Russian financial ties to environmental groups that push for ending U.S. fossil fuel production and have successfully shut down fracking sites and pipelines, to the detriment of U.S. workers and consumers.

Who benefits? Putin, because the desolation of U.S. energy security has bolstered state-owned Gazprom and his dangerous geopolitical aims.

Before the war on Ukraine, the U.S. Congress began exposing connections between Russia and little-known foundations that donate to major environmental groups such as Sierra Club and National Resource Defense Council (NRDC). The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works released a 2014 report noting a small group of rich Americans was controlling environmental groups and collaborating with questionable offshore funders to maximize support. In 2017, two congressmen called for further investigation of the connection between these funders and Russia.

These suspicious donations to radical environmental groups could be part of the larger geopolitical strategy Putin used to execute greater control over Europe before his invasion of Ukraine. For instance, if the United States had ramped up natural gas production, Putin could not today be blackmailing Poland and Bulgaria by cutting off their energy supply. Had America allowed more investment in fracking and other energy production, Putin would not have strategic leverage over Europe.

Most Americans know Putin does not want to see the United States succeed. What they may not know is these anti-energy groups acting under the guise of “environmental justice” are funded by a handful of wealthy Americans who are either blindingly naïve to the role they have played in supporting Putin’s agenda or willfully complicit.

There is no more notorious example than the Heinz Endowment, led by Teresa Heinz, wife of U.S. climate envoy John Kerry. Under her watch, the endowment has deployed at least $13 million toward anti-shale activism since 2008, killing jobs and prosperity in their own Pennsylvania backyard and unnecessarily forcing America to give up market share to tyrants like Putin.

The Heinz fortune funds dozens of Pennsylvania groups engaged in killing pipelines and natural gas production. One of their beneficiaries, Delaware Riverkeeper Network, is successfully fighting to keep a ban on natural gas production in the Delaware River Basin that is preventing access to vast new reserves.

In fact, Pennsylvania, where the Heinz family made their fortune and is still based, is bearing the brunt of this campaign. The latest example is the Keystone State’s addition to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Sierra Club and NRDC lobbied in favor of expanding the interstate compact to tax carbon emissions to include Pennsylvania, even though scientists at Penn State found 86 percent of carbon emissions will simply move to nearby states.

Killing pipelines, banning fracking, and implementing RGGI mean more energy will be produced in other countries with more emissions. Russian gas emits 40 percent more emissions over its lifecycle than U.S. natural gas; meanwhile, U.S. LNG is improving air quality in China. At the same time, Pennsylvanians could lose 22,000 jobs and consumers will face a 30 percent increase in their electricity bills.

We’re already seeing the unfortunate effects of these harmful policies elsewhere throughout the U.S. Under pressure from these same environmental groups, President Biden killed the Keystone XL pipeline, eliminating the projected 60,000 indirect jobs, 11,000 direct jobs, and $800 million in wages, that would have resulted from this important project.

As Putin now leverages his energy dominance as a tool of coercion and his geopolitical strategy is brutally playing out for all the world to see, Heinz and other radical environmental groups can no longer claim they are innocent arbiters of environmental justice when their actions have, intentionally or not, aided and abetted him.

Isn’t it time for these Americans to focus on policies that protect the earth, advance American energy security, and counter America’s enemies?

Biden's Creep Towards War In Ukraine Escalates With More Troop Talk,"President Joe Biden’s administration has slowly but steadily been creeping towards an escalation of United States involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Now, despite personal promises from Biden suggesting otherwise, U.S. officials say they are considering sending special operations forces into the Eastern European country to guard the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.

In addition to deploying dozens of special forces troops, officials are evaluating also sending a Marine security guard detachment to the affected area.

The Wall Street Journal reported that discussions of U.S. military involvement in Ukraine are still preliminary and have yet to reach the president’s desk, but they are being framed as a likely possibility if officials believe the embassy is severely threatened as Kyiv takes Russian fire.

Biden has repeatedly pledged not to send any U.S. troops to Ukraine after polling suggested that most Americans are against it.

President Joe Biden does not intend to send unilateral U.S. troops to Ukraine, White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki said, after Washington put some 8,500 troops on alert to reassure NATO allies in the face of a Russian military buildup https://t.co/4Hi0J1D6LJ pic.twitter.com/af52jx2fkH — Reuters (@Reuters) January 25, 2022

“We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,” Biden declared in March.

Biden reaffirmed this commitment in official remarks to Congress in April.

“We said we’d not send U.S. troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine, but we would provide robust military assistance and try to unify the Western world against Russia’s aggression,” Biden said.

Despite pledging not to send troops to fight Russians on Ukrainian soil, Biden and his administration have exacerbated the overseas conflict and furthered our nation’s role in it. He already sent hundreds of U.S. soldiers to NATO countries with hopes of getting as close to the ongoing war in Ukraine as possible.

Congress has yet to vote to officially authorize acts of war against Russia, but that hasn’t stopped some of the most high-ranking officials in the U.S. such as Biden, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, sitting members of Congress, intelligence agencies, and even American institutions such as the corporate media, from promoting a clash in Eastern Europe.

For months, the Biden administration has steadily increased its aggression toward Russia and Vladimir Putin. What started as a call to fund and defend a nation against an invasion from a dangerous dictator quickly morphed into a quest to undermine the Russian regime by whatever means necessary, with many suggesting a no-fly zone that would require NATO warplanes to shoot down Russian aircraft and practically amount to a declaration of war.

Biden, with the help of Congress, even signed a bill to send over $40 billion in taxpayer dollars to Ukraine. In his words, it will “allow us to send even more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish our own stockpile, and support U.S. troops stationed on NATO territory.”

While it’s still unclear whether Biden will follow his handlers’ lead and send troops to Ukraine, his verbal vow to keep the U.S. involved in Ukraine increases those chances greatly. And with encouragement from prime escalators in Congress and the corporate media, Biden could face massive peer pressure to show a presence in Ukraine under the guise of defending the American embassy.

Americans Don’t Trust Biden To Handle The Russia-Ukraine War,"Fewer Americans are willing to back Biden’s costly response to Russian aggression as domestic problems heighten because they don’t have confidence in his ability to handle the war in Ukraine.

A new poll from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that just 21 percent of Americans say they have “a great deal of confidence” in Biden to properly address the war in Eastern Europe. At least 39 percent, however, say they have “hardly any” confidence in the Democrat, whose approval rating hit an all-time low of 39 percent this week.

Overall, 54 percent of Americans say they disapprove of Biden’s handling of U.S. relations with Russia in general.

Because of their distrust in Biden, fewer Americans see taking action against Russia as a priority. In March, 55 percent of U.S. adults said sanctioning Russia should be a higher priority for the Biden administration than protecting the American economy. Since then, that number has dropped 10 percentage points.

Now, 51 percent of American adults say the federal government should focus on limiting damage to the U.S. economy which is already suffering from record-high gas prices and rising inflation. Biden, however, continues to blame the nation’s economic woes, which started long before shots were fired in Ukraine, on “Putin’s price hike.”

With help from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, Biden also devoted time and effort to funneling $40 billion in taxpayer dollars to the Ukrainian government, despite the fact that at least 32 percent of Americans surveyed by AP said they oppose sending funds directly to Ukraine.

Biden’s administration is also considering sending troops to the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, despite the president’s previous pledge to restrict military deployment to NATO countries only and Americans’ strong opposition to boots on the ground.

Hawley: $40 Billion To Ukraine Is Nation-Building That Hoses US Interests,"Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley is slamming his own party’s perceived prioritization of foreign aid over domestic interests. In an op-ed for Compact Magazine, Hawley condemned his fellow Republicans who supported the recently passed $40 billion Ukraine package.

“The cost alone is startling,” said Hawley. “It is three times what all of Europe has contributed to date and roughly the size of Ukraine’s entire national budget. Speaking of which, the bill includes funds for Ukraine’s treasury to the tune of $8.8 billion. And Biden administration officials suggest they will soon ask for more. This goes far beyond targeted military assistance. This package treats Ukraine as a client state of America, a fraught relationship that will put us on the hook for financing the war and then the reconstruction.”

Hawley chalked up Republican support of the bill to a neoconservative ideology that holds America has a duty to use its resources to aid struggling foreign countries and intervene in their wars. Hawley, however, believes the package is an example of Republicans’ skewed priorities stemming from the dogma that America should rebuild other nations in our image.

He wrote:

“The administration won’t give our own troops a raise that keeps pace with inflation. It won’t secure our southern border. It is dragging its feet on the force-posture changes needed in Asia to counter a rising China. But $40 billion is enough to give every American service member a real raise. It’s enough to build a wall at the border—twice over. And it would address all of our posture needs vis-à-vis Beijing, and then some.”

In support of the bill that Hawley criticized, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said, “There’s always been isolationist voices in the Republican Party. It won’t create a problem. We’ll get the job done.”

In contrast, Hawley said that America must instead have “robust nationalism” before bending over backward to aid in a foreign conflict.

Friedman Went To Lunch With Biden And Came Away Full Of Crap,"The New York Times’ Thomas Friedman — yes, the Thomas Friedman — ended his most recent and very bland column this week with the declaration that he had “left my lunch with the president with a full stomach but a heavy heart.”

Friedman no doubt left his meeting full and heavy. The article he churned out after his very important meal with President Biden is beyond bloated. Although Friedman said their conversation was off-record, he was gracious enough to tell his readers what he ate and how he “felt” about the encounter. In other words, it’s a typical Friedman column— practically useless.

His ultimate takeaway: Biden has been exceptionally good at managing our march to the brink of World War III. (It was apparently an epic failure that, unlike Biden, Donald Trump couldn’t goad Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine much sooner.)

“What I felt afterward was this,” wrote Friedman. “For all you knuckleheads on Fox who say that Biden can’t put two sentences together, here’s a news flash: He just put NATO together, Europe together and the whole Western alliance together — stretching from Canada up to Finland and all the way to Japan — to help Ukraine protect its fledgling democracy from Vladimir Putin’s fascist assault.”

Well, if that doesn’t make your heart soar with patriotism, I don’t know what will, FOLKS!

The only problem with that Olympian achievement Friedman credits to Biden is that it’s not true. Even if it were, which one of the people who voted for him feels that it made her life any better?

Setting aside that Ukraine isn’t a member of NATO, and thus is, in theory, owed nothing by the alliance, Biden hasn’t shown any degree of remarkable leadership there. He cut off our Russian energy imports, but our tried and true allies in Germany did not follow suit.

Biden requested that our reliable friends in Poland send fighter jets to Ukraine. Their response: No thanks! Great Britain sent their prime minister to Ukraine for a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Biden sent his wife. (I believe we shouldn’t be sending Americans to war zones where our national interests are, at best, ambiguous, but so long as we’re talking about leadership…)

The rest of Friedman’s article is a list of excuses for why Biden has been a suck of a president.

It’s Trump’s fault: “a movement by Trump and his supporters … is not propelled by any coherent set of policies, but rather by a gigantic lie…”

It’s Democrats’ fault: “House Democrats also sullied one of Biden’s most important bipartisan achievements — a giant infrastructure bill — by making it hostage to other excessive spending demands. The far left also saddled Biden and every Democratic candidate with radical notions like ‘defund the police.'”

It’s America’s fault: “[W]ith every passing day, every mass shooting, every racist dog whistle, every defund-the-police initiative, every nation-sundering Supreme Court ruling, every speaker run off a campus, every bogus claim of election fraud, I wonder if he can bring us back together. I wonder if it’s too late.”

I’m sure Friedman, a writer at America’s most important newspaper, truly enjoyed his lunch with Biden. It must have made him feel really special to be invited to the White House by the president of the United States.

But it’s time for him to admit what the rest of us have known for a long time now: Biden is an embarrassment and it’s not because of circumstances out of his control. Biden is the circumstance that needs to be controlled.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/24/thomas-friedman-went-to-lunch-with-joe-biden-and-left-full-of-crap/,2022-05-24
Congress Armed Ukraine Instead Of American Classrooms,"Ten years ago, the deadly Connecticut massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School wherein a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, proved the need to secure U.S. K-12 institutions. Around noon on Tuesday, a similar tragedy was repeated after a decade of failing to protect American schools and deal with America’s mental health crisis.

In Uvalde, Texas, an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School as he went on a rampage from classroom to classroom after shooting his own grandmother. President Joe Biden was quick to address the nation in prime time, eager to exploit the episode of violence as a rallying cry for gun control.

“When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” the president asked.

That he would make comments like this tells you he doesn’t care at all about what happened. He doesn’t care about the victims. He doesn’t care about their families.



All he cares about is name-checking stale, left-wing talking points on the DNC’s to-do list. https://t.co/haV7fT6o0g — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) May 25, 2022

Just last week, Biden also harnessed a racially charged shooting at a Buffalo, New York supermarket to go after his political enemies. Yet he was oddly absent from Wisconsin last fall when a black suspect motivated by anti-white racism allegedly rammed an SUV through a holiday parade, brutally killing at least six. The president’s selective presence based on political circumstances is just as much reflected in where the White House has decided to allocate scarce tax dollars in a series of colossal spending packages.

On Sunday, President Biden signed $40 billion ($40,000,000,000) in additional U.S. spending on Ukraine, roughly $20 billion of which is direct military assistance and less than $2 billion of which is allocated to humanitarian efforts. That’s after nearly $14 billion in American dollars were sent to the war-torn country in March.

Last year, the president also signed the $1.9 trillion ($1,900,000,000,000) “American Rescue Plan,” capping off $180 billion in federal dollars to K-12 schools over the Covid lockdowns. None of the above was a serious upgrade in armed school security even though lawmakers protect themselves with the kind of resources denied to students.

K-12 schools remain among the most unprotected institutions in America despite the tragic new need for change proven a decade ago. In 2019, Democrats even blocked a proposal to arm teachers with federal dollars.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/25/sandy-hook-proved-the-need-to-enhance-k-12-security-congress-armed-ukraine-instead/,2022-05-25
McConnell's Brag About Boosting Biden's Foreign Policy Was Ill-Advised,"Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky went on a big media tour to praise President Biden’s foreign policy, to take credit for a massive additional spending package for Ukraine, and to virulently attack the 11 Republican senators and 57 Republican members of Congress who voted against it.

“McConnell Casts Ukraine Vote as Victory Over Republican Party’s Isolationist Wing,” touted the Wall Street Journal, using a derogatory and inaccurate term to describe the growing coalition that opposes Biden’s non-strategic foreign policy that appears untethered to any long-term national security interest.

McConnell wants to be associated with the Democrats’ bill, and he should be remembered as having helped its passage. In fact, he worked with Democrats to expand the bill from President Biden’s initial request of $33 billion and to smooth legislative hurdles for easy passage. The passage of the bill brings the total U.S. funding for Ukraine’s defensive war against Russia to more than $50 billion.

McConnell’s victory tour was lapped up by a D.C. media establishment that shares his goal of returning the Republican Party to its Bush-era foreign policy, and to disparage any voices supportive of former President Donald Trump, who had expressed concern about the costs and national security risks of escalating the war in Russia.

“Why are we giving more than $40 billion to Ukraine while Europe, by comparison, is giving very little, and they are greatly more impacted by a Russian invasion, obviously, than the U.S.,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri tweeted, “Spending $40 billion on Ukraine aid – more than three times what all of Europe has spent combined – is not in America’s interests. It neglects priorities at home (the border), allows Europe to freeload, short changes critical interests abroad and comes w/ no meaningful oversight. That’s not isolationism. That’s nationalism. It’s about prioritizing American security and American interests.”

By contrast, National Review praised the passage of the bill and mocked concerns over the dollar amount.

Still, nearly one in four Republican senators declined to support the massive spending package.

“It’s a small isolationist group, somewhat encouraged by the former president. But it’s not widely held among Republicans in Congress, and I don’t think among the public in general,” McConnell told Politico.

“Opposing big government spending is not isolationism, it’s common sense,” Paul responded dryly. “Our country faces an inflation crisis and adding more debt now is a mistake.”

Working to avoid quagmires and nuclear wars during a time of economic malaise is not “isolationism,” but it’s also not true that the group opposing McConnell and Biden is “small.”

Just a few weeks ago, the D.C. establishment went all out to prevent the nomination of Ohio’s J.D. Vance for the Senate. He had expressed strong opposition to neoliberal foreign policy, including in its application in Ukraine. Vance won. One of the 11 senators who voted no — John Boozman of Arkansas — almost certainly did so bolstered by a desire to win his looming primary.

Paul and Boozman were joined by Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama in voting against the bill. McConnell was able to get Ted Cruz and others to join Mitt Romney and John Cornyn in voting for the war package — and get each of them to put out defensive statements about why they did it — but the response from voters was not what they hoped for.

The Republicans cast their vote just before polling showed that Republicans were beginning to seriously sour on McConnell’s plan to embroil them in another lengthy war, just months after the disastrous end of the poorly managed Afghanistan war.

Wars are always popular initially, and the U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s battle against the Russian invasion was no exception. Pollsters liked to trumpet that fact when only a few brave pundits and analysts were pushing back against the D.C. groupthink in favor of escalation.

But left-wing pollster Morning Consult showed that “Republican voters are increasingly skeptical of America’s role in Ukraine,” and that “The share of GOP voters who say the U.S. is doing ‘too much’ in Ukraine has doubled since early March.”

For the first time in the poll, the share of Republicans who say the United States is doing “too much” exceeded the percentage that said the United States was doing “too little.”

And a brand-new Associated Press poll shows that voters across the political spectrum are souring on the Biden-McConnell foreign policy approach toward Ukraine.

“Americans are becoming less supportive of punishing Russia for launching its invasion of Ukraine if it comes at the expense of the U.S. economy,” the Associated Press reports.

In March, a majority of Americans polled said the United States should make sanctioning Russia effectively its priority. Now, a majority say that limiting economic damage to the United States should be the priority.

McConnell’s decision to latch himself to Biden’s foreign policy approach — and bash his colleagues who oppose it — comes at a time Biden is dealing with the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, according to the Associated Press. While Americans continue to support assisting Ukraine, only a minority of 44 percent favor sending funds directly to the scandal-ridden country. Another 32 percent are opposed and 23 percent were neither in favor nor opposed.

And fully 49 percent of Americans polled expressed a desire for the United States to have only a minor role. The United States is far and away the biggest funder of the war effort.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/27/mitch-mcconnells-media-tour-to-brag-about-defeating-gop-opponents-of-bidens-foreign-policy-was-remarkably-ill-advised/,2022-05-27
GOP Neocons Unclear On Where $40 Billion For Ukraine Will Come From,"President Joe Biden signed a $40 billion aid package to Ukraine over a week ago, bringing total taxpayer funding for the war-torn nation to roughly $54 billion with Republican support — but where exactly these additional funds are coming from remains a mystery.

The bill, which offers $7 billion more than the president requested, passed the House with 149 Republicans voting in favor, and another 25 Republicans in the Senate securing its passage a week later. Only 57 Republicans in the House and 11 Republicans in the Senate voted in opposition.

GOP Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley condemned the package as a colossal donation made against “American interests.”

“It neglects priorities at home (the border), allows Europe to freeload, short changes critical interests abroad and comes w/ no meaningful oversight,” Hawley tweeted ahead of the Senate vote. He also published an op-ed critical of a neocon resurgence within the Republican Party last Tuesday.

Republicans outside congressional leadership who championed the bill include Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw.

Days after the vote in the lower chamber, Crenshaw went on Fox News to defend his support for the billions sent to Ukraine, calling it a vehicle to pivot our foreign policy focus from Russia to China.

“This is an investment in the severe degradation of our second biggest adversary, the Russian military,” Crenshaw said. “That allows us to do something. That allows us to focus on our actual biggest adversary, which is China.”

Graham made a similar case on the same network, claiming the fate of Taiwan depends on the fate of the Ukrainians.

“China is just waiting to see what to do with Taiwan. All the chips in the world for our high-tech industry come from Taiwan. So, there’s a lot at stake here,” Graham said, conceding that more federal attention ought to be paid to domestic issues. “We should have rational border policies. We don’t.”

Christian Whiton, a former senior adviser in the State Department under Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump who now serves as a senior fellow for the Center for National Interest, told The Federalist that if lawmakers were serious about a pivot to China, they would be already pivoting to China, not Ukraine.

“If you want to focus on Asia, you focus on Asia. This will get us deeper in the issues of Europe,” Whiton said of the billions in taxpayer dollars being shipped off to Ukraine. “We are actually increasing the moral hazard where we let Europe off the hook where we’re paying for its security. None of that is going to make it easier to shift to Asia.”

Lawmakers can’t give a straight answer on where exactly Congress’s appropriated funds for Ukraine will ultimately come from. When asked whether they would support raising taxes to pay for the $54 billion to Ukraine, each of the three — Crenshaw, Graham, and Ernst — offered different answers. Crenshaw’s office offered no response, while Ernst’s spokeswoman responded with a simple “no.”

Speaking in mid-May, Graham’s communications director Kevin Bishop told The Federalist the issue hadn’t yet been discussed.

“Graham has expressed support, including speaking on the floor yesterday, about seizing Russian oligarch assets to help with the costs associated with Ukraine,” Bishop said.

Whiton warned of “finite defense budgets” as tax dollars become scarcer amid recession and fiscal crises brought by unrestrained Washington spending.

“If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority,” Whiton said. “Frankly when it comes to spending, when it comes to our attention span our focus needs to be on China now, not in some distant future.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/31/gop-neocons-unclear-on-where-40-billion-for-ukraine-will-come-from/,2022-05-31
Biden To World: Russia Controls The U.S. Economy,"On Friday, after news broke that inflation again accelerated to reach a 40-year high of 8.6 percent, President Joe Biden turned America’s financial crisis into a national security one by telling the world that foreign leaders have near-total control over the U.S. economy.

Shortly after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released May’s price report, which in addition to reporting an 8.6 percent annual inflationary rate showed a full 1 percent increase last month, President Biden began the spin: “Today’s report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top economic priority. While it is good to see critical ‘core’ inflation moderating, it is not coming down as sharply and as quickly as we must see. Putin’s price hike hit hard in May here and around the world: high gas prices at the pump, energy, and food prices accounted for around half of the monthly price increases.”

The president’s entire pitch struck a chord conflicting with reality. “Biden hasn’t made inflation his top economic priority,” noted Katie Pavlich soon after. “For months, his administration denied inflation was happening, saying it wouldn’t be an issue, before calling it temporary and transitory last summer.” And the skyrocketing inflation began before Russia’s January 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The public has long known that Biden suffers from an acute case of blameuitis. But the president’s continued claims that Putin holds responsibility for our country’s accelerating inflationary rates, when coupled with Biden’s other actions and inactions, is not merely tone deaf, it is dangerous. While finger-pointing has long been a mainstay for politicians, the Biden administration’s messaging goes beyond shifting blame to conceding that foreign leaders can control the U.S. economy in Joe Biden’s America.

President Biden’s reported plans to meet with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a trip to the region next month confirm this. Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-largest oil producer behind the United States, serves as the “unofficial head of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),” and the planned visit seems certain to push for more oil production from OPEC countries.

Goes Begging on His Knees to Country He Spurned

The announcement of President Biden’s intent to meet with bin Salman represents a course change so sharp that it will be seen as the United States’ complete subservience to the country Biden promised to make “the pariah that they are” shortly before his election.

In the waning days of Donald Trump’s presidency, “Biden promised to take a hard line on Saudi Arabia, saying he would rip up the ‘dangerous blank check’ that Trump had written for the Saudis.” During a 2019 presidential debate, Biden added that there is “very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.”

After his election, Biden “released a U.S. intelligence report that concluded that Prince Mohammed had approved the plan to capture or kill [journalist Jamal Khashoggi], who had been an outspoken critic of the young Saudi ruler.” The Biden administration then continued its efforts to distance itself from Saudi Arabia then, with then-Press Secretary Jen Psaki saying “the Biden administration will ‘recalibrate’ how it treats the kingdom.”

The Biden administration also moved to isolate bin Salman, with Psaki calling his father, King Salman, President Biden’s “counterpart.” This pronouncement, notwithstanding the fact that bin Salman has been considered the “de facto ruler” of Saudi Arabia for some time, seemed to declare the Biden administration unwilling to work with the Saudi leader.

Just more than a year later, however, with Putin’s troops poised to invade Ukraine, the Biden administration is abruptly changing course, and Saudi Arabia has certainly noticed. The president’s staff tried unsuccessfully to arrange a call between Biden and bin Salman “as the U.S. was working to build international support for Ukraine and contain a surge in oil prices.”

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that “Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the U.A.E.’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both declined U.S. requests to speak to Mr. Biden in recent weeks.” “A U.S. official” told the Wall Street Journal that “the planned discussion” “was part of turning on the spigot [of Saudi oil].”

While snubbing Biden, the Wall Street Journal reported that “both Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed took phone calls from Russian President Vladimir Putin,” in late February or early March, “after declining to speak with Mr. Biden.

At the time, the Biden administration maintained “there were no plans for Mr. Biden to travel to Saudi Arabia.” Just law week, however, Biden’s current press secretary acknowledged the president intends to visit Saudi Arabia, although details have yet to be confirmed.

Putin may have brought Biden to his knees, but these formerly spurned Saudi princes now have the leader of the free world crawling across the desert sands for help from the man who told the Atlantic just three months ago that he simply did “not care” whether the American president understood him. “It’s up to him to think about the interests of America,” bin Zayed said about Biden.

America Is Strong When It Controls Its Own Energy

Groveling to Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC countries does not serve America’s interests. America’s interests are best served by policies promoting energy independence—something first achieved in 2019 under President Trump.

Since taking office, however, the Biden administration has pushed for a dramatic move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From canceling the Keystone Pipeline to attempting to halt new leases for drilling on public land and offshore, these policies render America more dependent on foreign energy sources led by ruthless dictators, like Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Democrats like Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow portray electric vehicles as the solution, with Stabenow gushing about her new electric car that she claimed to have driven from Michigan to D.C., bypassing “every single gas station” along the way, with no concerns over gas prices. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity for us to move to vehicles that aren’t going to be dependent on the whims of the oil companies and the international markets,” the Michigan Democrat added.

The move to electric vehicles will not lessen our country’s dependence on problematic countries, however. On the contrary, China holds a near monopoly on cobalt and lithium, two rare-earth metals necessary to produce electric car batteries. “China controls around 86.5 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s cobalt exports,” with Congo holding “around 60 percent of the world’s mined cobalt.”

In fact, Hunter Biden played a role in helping China obtain a stranglehold over the cobalt supply when a company he founded worked with Chinese investors to arrange for China to purchase the Congolese cobalt mine, Tenke Fungurume, from its American owner.

With China now controlling the metals necessary to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, the communist country holds undue sway over every country committed to abandoning fossil fuels. That includes Joe Biden’s America. Putin is proving it.

Now Is A Great Time For The Real Fiscal Conservatives To Stand Up,"President Joe Biden recently took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal to explain his plan: spend more money, raise taxes, and let the Federal Reserve go on doing what they’re doing. As Federalist Senior Contributor Christopher Jacobs argues about Biden’s plan, “At best, the political messaging behind Biden’s ‘plan’ would do little to solve Americans’ pain. More likely, it would make the problem worse.”

This was followed up by the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre assuring skeptical reporters that the U.S. economy is in a “good position.” When confronted with so much evidence suggesting otherwise, Jean-Pierre insisted the real issue was mostly people’s lack of confidence. This was the line that Fortune Magazine also took with its recent article, “What Causes a Recession? Maybe It’s You and How Grumpy You Are About the Economy.”

Of course, this is ridiculous. As it stands, Americans — particularly millennial Americans trying to buy property, start their families, and save for retirement — are feeling the pinch from all directions. Inflation has basically given everyone what feels like a 30 percent pay cut as well as eliminated 30 percent of their savings.

House prices have also skyrocketed to more than twice their value in the past few years, particularly here in North Texas. Meanwhile, gas prices continue to climb as stations use the “summer-blend,” leaving many people little choice except to wallow at home and use as little air conditioning as possible.

Although economists and conservatives tend to go into the weeds about the causes for the current economic malaise, this really isn’t a mystery. Too much government spending resulted in the Fed producing more dollars, which in turn devalued the currency.

Added to this are federal regulations that squelch oil production, making everything more expensive to create, operate, and transport. Finally, concerning the property shortage, this is worsened again with federal regulations that make it harder to produce houses for middle and working-class families.

Since these are the causes for today’s economic dysfunction, the solutions should be straightforward: cut spending, stop producing more dollars (if possible, the Fed should burn them in a bonfire like Heath Ledger’s Joker), lower taxes, encourage domestic energy production through regulation and subsidies, and stop trying to turn growing suburbs into urban hellscapes. Once those things are done, political leaders can tend to the other details that affect the economy like interest rates, taxes, tariffs, immigration, and entitlement spending.

Yet what leader is really saying anything practical about any of this? As Biden’s op-ed indicates, Democrats seemed poised to double down on failed policy, spending profligately, curbing energy production, and devising ever more regulations to accommodate protected minority groups. Even if this proves disastrous for the middle class, it works just fine for the progressive clerisy who profit from this and their constituent serfs who don’t have to pay for it directly.

Republicans running for office largely confine themselves to reacting to the latest leftist outrage until their inevitable victory in November. They seem far more interested in discussing anything — Ukraine, gun control, Pride month — than the economy. And judging from current GOP lawmakers’ willingness to approve spending $40 billion for corrupt countries like Ukraine and $11 billion for corrupt organizations like the FBI, there’s little reason to believe they’ll make any significant changes once they have the majority.

Ironically, it wasn’t so long ago that conservatives and most of the GOP had much more to say about fiscal matters. Indeed before Trump’s election, that’s almost all they talked about (remember Paul Ryan and the “Reformicons”?). Conservative writers would gush about the glories of supply-side economics and warn of all kinds of doom if the federal government abandoned fiscal discipline.

To be fair, much of this was pretty dry reading and probably pushed away more people than it brought in, particularly the economically-illiterate adults graduating from college. Then there was Donald Trump’s victory in 2016, which many took as proving the futility of campaigning on the economy. Consequently, conservative writers and Republican politicians focused their efforts on cultural issues and being more bellicose in their rhetoric.

This strategy might work, but it’s not a sure thing. The economy still matters, now more than ever. It’s important to remember that so much of Trump’s popularity was tied to the economic boom he brought about before the Covid lockdowns. Sure enough, he did this by lowering taxes, boosting energy production, and cutting federal regulations. Had he enjoyed more political capital and less resistance from everyone around him, he could have also cut spending and thereby curbed the production of more dollars.

Republicans need to understand that mere bluster is not enough, and no one can do it quite like the Donald. However, they can adopt his best policies and add to them. And they don’t even have to wait until 2024. It’s entirely possible to effect reform and save the economy with a Democrat in the Oval Office — much like the GOP did in ‘90s under Newt Gingrich.

Not only would a clear agenda for economic reform potentially draw in even more voters away from the morally and fiscally compromised Democrat Party, but this would actually help real Americans. The stakes are uncomfortably high, and if the federal government continues on its current trajectory, the United States will increasingly resemble dysfunctional countries in Latin America where an unaccountable and corrupt elite class rules over a powerless populace. This already seems to be the case in states like California, and if Republicans continue doing nothing, it will be the case all over the country.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/13/now-would-be-a-great-time-for-the-real-fiscal-conservatives-to-stand-up/,2022-06-13
"In Starker Terms Than Ever, China Threatens War Over Taiwan","China’s defense minister threatened to go to war over Taiwan at the Shangri-La Dialogue Conference in Singapore last weekend.

The annual conference was organized by the United Kingdom-based International Institute of Strategic Studies and aims to bring Asian and Western defense ministers together to discuss security issues through friendly dialogue. But it was less a dialogue and more a war of words. China was defiant and confrontational and the Biden administration continued to be ambiguous and uninspiring, but Japan surprisingly stepped up its game.

The Chinese delegation was led by China’s Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe, who insisted that the “Development of the military of China is never intended to threaten others or to seek hegemony. China is never a threat and has never threatened any others.” Yet Wei quickly discredited his own talking point by repeatedly threatening war over Taiwan.

In his meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on the sideline of the Singapore conference, Wei declared, “If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will definitely not hesitate to start a war no matter the cost.” He further vowed that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would “smash to smithereens any Taiwan independence plot and resolutely uphold the unification of the motherland.” International observers, including Taiwanese officials, pointed to Wei’s defiant language as evidence that China is in fact “the source of major unrest in the region.”

Unprecedented War Talk

Then Wei used his speech on the conference’s final day to reiterate that Taiwan “is a province of China … If anyone dares to secede Taiwan from China, we will not hesitate to fight. We will fight at all costs. And we will fight to the very end. This is the only choice for China.” Furthermore, Wei said Taiwan’s reunification with mainland China is an “historical trend that no one or no force can stop.”

Communist China drawing a red line on the Taiwan issue was nothing new. Beijing has long insisted that Taiwan is part of Communist China’s territory. But Chinese government officials usually deployed war-like language on the Taiwan issue only when addressing a domestic audience. To an international audience, Beijing’s official line on Taiwan had always been that China would seek a “peaceful” reunification with Taiwan, but wouldn’t rule out using force to make it happen.

No other Chinese officials have made an explicit threat of war over Taiwan on the international stage, especially in front of American officials, like Wei did. That’s why Wei’s remarks became headline news around the world.

War Preparation

Wei’s belligerent war talk isn’t an empty threat. The Chinese government has stepped up its war preparations. The PLA has built the world’s largest navy, measured by fleet size. Since 2020, the PLA has sent thousands of military aircraft into Taiwan’s Air Defense Zone, including 30 such incursions in last month alone.

In addition to harassing and intimidating Taiwan’s air defense, China’s Air Force sent fighter jets from one of its militarized islands in the South China Sea to intercept Australian and Canadian military planes over international waters, resulting in dangerous encounters. The PLA has conducted several military exercises near Taiwan, with each exercise amounting to a full-scale rehearsal of an invasion of Taiwan.

China has also expanded its nuclear weapons development program rapidly in recent years, including developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can carry multiple nuclear warheads and hit the continental United States. China has kept its nuclear program in secrecy and refused to join the United States in nuclear arms-control talks. Wei claimed that China’s nuclear arsenal buildup was justified for self-defense, but The Wall Street Journal, quoting people familiar with Chinese leadership’s thinking, said China’s nuclear weapons buildup is driven by a possible clash with the United States over Taiwan.

Muted U.S. Response

In contrast to Wei’s unmistakable threat, U.S. Defense Secretary Austin offered a rather muted response. He reiterated that Washington remains committed to the “one-China policy.” Furthermore, he stressed that the United States stands “firmly behind the principle that cross-strait differences must be resolved by peaceful means,” but would continue to fulfill its commitments to Taiwan. He didn’t explain what those commitments are.

While Austin’s words were technically correct, they sounded weak and uninspiring. He missed a great opportunity to forcefully push back China’s war threat and clarify U.S. policy on Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. His lack of clarity failed to reassure U.S. allies in Asia.

It also didn’t help that three times, President Biden publicly declared that the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, only to have his aides walk back his statements, suggesting he didn’t mean what he said each time. In the Wall Street Journal, Walter Russell Mead wrote that America’s traditional allies such as Indonesia are “tuning the Americans out” because they perceive the Biden administration has a credibility issue.

Japan’s Strong Response

Surprisingly, Japan demonstrated how to inspire confidence in allies and stand up to China convincingly. Given the geographical proximity of Taiwan and Japan, Japan regards a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as a direct threat to Japan’s security. Influential Japanese politicians such as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have been vocal about defending Taiwan.

One of the Singapore conference’s highlights was Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s announcement that Japan would “fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities within the next five years.” Citing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine early this year as a wake-up call for Japan, Kishida warned that “Ukraine today may be the East Asia [of] tomorrow.” Without naming China directly, he said, “We must be prepared for the emergence of an entity that tramples on the peace and security of other countries by force or threat without honoring the rules.”

Kishida promised to dramatically increase Japan’s defense budget, referring to the defense target of NATO members, 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), as Japan’s new goal. Currently, Japan’s defense spending is close to 1 percent of its GDP. Kishida also pledged to provide aid to Indo-Pacific countries, spending “at least $2 billion over the next three years for maritime security equipment, including patrol vessels, and to support maritime transportation infrastructure.”

One important lesson the world should learn from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is that we must take war threats from autocracies seriously. Putin had warned the West for years that he intended to invade Ukraine. He was emboldened after Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 met a muted response from the West.

Last year, Putin released a manifesto to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But few governments, including the Biden administration, took Putin’s threat seriously. A few months later, Putin did exactly what he vowed to do, and the West was still caught unprepared and scrambled to respond.

China has always been very transparent about its intentions toward Taiwan. Wei’s war threat in Singapore offered further clarification of what Beijing plans to do. Ignoring China’s repeated warnings would be a grave mistake.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/17/in-starker-terms-than-ever-china-threatens-war-over-taiwan/,2022-06-17
"Kamala Harris Is So Unpopular, She Can't Sell Photo Ops","While Americans are paying record prices for everyday items from groceries to gasoline, there’s one market where demand has failed to keep up with sky high inflation: photos with Vice President Kamala Harris.

According to Tara Palmeri, formerly of Politico and now at Puck News, the DNC cut the cost for a photo with Harris at a California fundraiser with the Women’s Leadership Forum from $15,000 to $5,000. The rare price cut in the Biden economy came after the event reportedly struggled to sell enough tickets.

DNC is slashing prices for a photo w/ Kamala Harris. Tickets for a photo with the VP at the Women's Leadership Forum started at $15,000, but it failed to sell enough tickets & is being postponed. VP's June fundraiser in Cali is charging $5,000 for a photo https://t.co/yQawQ9hKfl — Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) June 21, 2022

According to the latest data from the Department of Labor, Americans across-the-board, including DNC donors, are now paying 10 percent more for groceries, 16 percent more for used cars, 34 percent more for energy, but 67 percent less for pictures with the vice president.

Beyond the dismal approval ratings, wherein 52 percent, or more than half the country sees the vice president unfavorably compared to less than 40 percent who report otherwise, the lack of interest in the first female leader to occupy the Naval Observatory remains somewhat of a mystery.

Since coming into office, Harris, 57, has developed a record of distracting a public in distress from the 79-year-old president’s woes with words of inspiration and celerity-like candor so strong that children seemed enamored by her animated explanation of space exploration. Never mind the vice president’s audience was full of paid child actors.

In March, the vice president’s intelligence was on full display as someone prepared to assume to Oval Office at a moment’s notice when she described the war in Ukraine.

“So Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia,” she told a radio audience on the “Morning Hustle. “Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically, that’s wrong.”

The comments offered a stellar analysis from an articulate leader whose comments throughout her brief time in the administration have already become enshrined on motivational posters and videos.

U.S. Navy Pushes Trans Pronouns While Overseeing Readiness Decline,"The U.S. Navy has issued an instructional video training its members to create a “safe space” by using “correct” pronouns. The video emphasized how service members must use “inclusive languages” and not “misgender” others.

For example, “Instead of saying something like ‘Hey, guys,’ you can say, ‘Hey, everyone,’ or ‘Hey, team.’” The video warned not to pressure others to disclose their pronouns because “some people may be going through the process of discovery.”

The video also offered a tip for memorizing someone’s pronouns by “going through a progression of three good things about the person using their pronouns … i.e. ‘They have a nice shirt. They have a nice smile. They are really smart.’”

This cringe-worthy video was reportedly modeled after a children’s show, which explains why the two hosts acted as if they were talking to kindergartners, even though their intended audience is full-grown adults. The video was part of the Biden administration’s and Pentagon top brass’s push to make the U.S. military a welcoming place for transgender service members. The U.S. Army offers similar gender identity training and coaches officers on when to provide soldiers with gender transition surgery.

Imposing Politicized Lies While The World Burns

These mandatory trainings occur at a time the U.S.-led liberal world order, which has guaranteed peace and prosperity for seven decades post World War II, faces grave threats from adversaries such as Russia and China.

The Russia-Ukraine war has been going on for almost four months. It has resulted in the loss of lives, millions of refugees, rising energy prices, worldwide food inflation, and food shortages. Sen. Marco Rubio warned, “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not the first time an authoritarian regime invaded its neighbor and, unfortunately, it won’t be the last.” He’s right, because China is currently planning a war over Taiwan. Between Russia and China, China presents a much more serious military challenge to the United States.

Take the Chinese Navy as an example. China has tripled its naval battle force within two decades and built the world’s largest navy, measured by the number of battle force ships. According to CNN, “Between 2014 and 2018, China launched more submarines, warships, amphibious vessels, and auxiliaries than the number of ships currently serving in the individual navies of Germany, India, Spain, and the United Kingdom.”

China today has 355 battle-force ships and continues to build more. Early this week, China launched its third and largest aircraft carrier, domestically designed and built. In a provocative move, China named its new aircraft “Fujian,” the coastal province closest to Taiwan. Experts project that the Chinese Navy will have 460 battle force ships by 2030.

In addition to building ships, China has also expanded its overseas military base. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) already has a base in Djibouti, an East African nation. Early this year, China and the Solomon Islands signed a security pact, which many people suspect would grant the Chinese Navy a permanent base in the South Pacific. Last week, The Washington Post reported that China is building a naval facility in Cambodia for its exclusive use “and taking extraordinary measures to conceal the operation.” The PLA is also rumored to be actively looking for a base in West Africa or the Middle East.

Depleted U.S. Navy Wastes Time on False Pronouns

While China is expanding its navy capacity and footprints, the U.S. Navy has been going in the opposite direction. The number of U.S. Navy battle-force ships has shrunk from 318 in 2000 to 296 in 2021. In addition to a smaller fleet size, many ships are reaching their expiration date without replacements. The shrinking fleet size and aging naval assets have already affected the U.S. Navy’s ability to maintain its peacetime commitment worldwide.

Last summer, the U.S. Navy reportedly had to “divert its only Pacific aircraft carrier to deal with the withdrawal from Afghanistan.” Some also pointed out that the U.S. Navy had spent less time patrolling the Black Sea in recent years, which might have inadvertently emboldened Putin to take action on Ukraine.

Jim Townsend, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, D.C., said, “so much of deterrence and dealing with other nations geopolitically has do with presence… If you’re not there one way or another, then the assumption is you don’t care about it.” Even though some experts believe the U.S. Navy is more capable of naval warfare than any other navy, including the untested Chinese Navy, the quantity of battle force ships still matters in deterring wars, preserving peace, and winning the wars if they start.

Future Shrinkage Expected

Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday estimated that to effectively counter adversaries like China and meet the U.S. global security commitment, the U.S. Navy needs “about 350 ships and another 150 unmanned or lightly manned vessels, for a total of 500.” Since shipbuilding takes time, Gilday was describing a vision for 2045. Meanwhile, China doesn’t wait idly. Adm. Philip Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned that China could invade Taiwan within six years.

Recognizing the precarious situation U.S. Navy was in, the Trump administration announced an ambitious fleet plan toward the end of its first term. But the Biden administration shelved the project and continued to downsize the Navy in the name of “divest to invest.” The Navy’s 2023 budget plans to purchase nine ships while retiring 24. The projection is that by 2027, the U.S. Navy will have only 280 battle force ships. The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it bluntly, “The truth is the Navy finds itself without the resources to expand its fleet or sustain its current ships, and some of its inventory is ill-suited for the next fight.”

Instead of giving the U.S. Navy the necessary resources to maintain peace and prepare for the next war, the Biden administration has focused on pushing wokeism in the U.S. military. According to information obtained by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Department of Defense has spent close to 6 million man-hours and $1 million on trainings across the military regarding climate change, extremism, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

This training took place as the military already reported not getting enough preparation for combat due to budget constraints. For example, the Navy said it had to reduce pilots’ flying hours by 10 or 20 percent.

Any concerned citizen ought to ask: Is providing pronoun training the best way to deploy the U.S. military’s limited resources? How does such training prepare our service members for wars? If our soldiers need a “safe space” to escape any perceived harm of “misgendering,” what happens when missiles are flying and bullets are fired during combat? Do our military top brass and the Biden administration truly believe that wokeism is America’s best defense? Will it deter adversaries and keep the United States and its allies safe?

One of the critical lessons of America’s humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan is that regardless of our military capability, disaster can happen when our political and military leaders are distracted. Our adversaries are constantly looking for opportunities to exploit our weaknesses in order to advance their own geopolitical ambitions. If the political and military leaders of this country continue to invest in getting the military woke rather than preparing it for growing geopolitical threats, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan may not be the last failure we witness.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/24/u-s-navy-pushes-transgender-pronouns-while-allowing-massive-war-preparedness-gaps/,2022-06-24
"After $54 Billion, Zelensky Wants Billions More From American Taxpayers","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for his usual order of war aid in a speech yesterday after a Russian missile struck a Kremenchuk shopping mall, killing at least 12 people, Zelensky said, and injuring 24. Zelensky demanded more help from the West, despite the United States pouring billions of dollars into his government’s coffers while voters grapple with a struggling economy at home.

“The world can, and therefore must, stop Russian terror,” Zelensky’s speech read. “And now I can already say this – I heard it from our partners: Ukraine must get reliable missile defense, we are expecting the supply of appropriate systems.”

Zelensky seeks to portray Ukraine’s war with Russia as the world’s war with Russia. From his expectation of funding and weapon supply to his targeted language describing Russia as the “largest terrorist organization in the world,” Zelensky understands he needs to convince the world it has a stake in his war if he wants their support.

Yesterday’s speech follows Zelensky’s April statement that Ukraine needs $7 billion monthly to replenish the resources depleted by the war with Russia. Zelensky’s assumption that the world will provide it, though brash, is by no means unfounded.

From the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February to May, the U.S. alone has delivered around $54 billion in aid to Ukraine. The U.S. has sent $6.1 billion in weapons and equipment, per a June 24 Department of Defense report, though that number doesn’t encompass every military-related expense we’ve incurred in support of Ukraine. Using his Presidential Drawdown authority, President Biden has pulled our own military resources to give billions of dollars worth of equipment and weapons to Ukraine. Biden has issued 13 drawdowns for Ukraine since August 2021.

Amidst billions of dollars worth of supplies, ammunition, vehicles, body armor, and radars, the U.S. has sent more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (likely valued at around $630 million), more than 6,500 Javelin anti-armor systems (an estimated cost of more than $1 billion), more than 20,000 other anti-armor systems, over 700 Switchblade drones (estimated to cost more than $4 million), 126 155mm Howitzers (worth as much as $94 million) and hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, 20 Mi-17 helicopters (worth around $300 million), and eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. This tally does not include the expense of the more than 100,000 troops Biden has deployed to NATO-member countries since the Russian invasion.

Our bill is already more than 7 percent of the U.S. 2022 defense budget. Even more astounding, the $54 billion we’ve sent is more than the entire requested budget for the U.S. Marine Corps. Yet Zelensky still wants more from us. As for the $40 billion in aid Biden signed off on in May, there is no direct oversight in how the money is being allocated. With no fiscal responsibility, one has to wonder where the money is going once it reaches Ukraine — and whether it’s even making it into the right hands.

Ukraine ranked the second most corrupt country in Europe in Transparency International’s 2021 Corrupt Perceptions Index, second only to Russia. Zelensky recently tightened control by shutting down the opposition’s TV stations and banning over 10 political parties in Ukraine.

“Through his tenure, Transparency International registered a rise in the level of corruption perceived by the Ukrainian public,” Cristian Nitoiu of Loughborough University, told Al Jazeera. “In the policy and academic sphere, Zelensky has been frequently criticised for being in the pocket of Ukrainian oligarchs who did not have a privileged position under Poroshenko’s presidency.”

With billions of dollars in aid packages and yet no fiscal responsibility, there is no way to track what went where. We are funding a notoriously corrupt country with the added logistical nightmare of wartime. Worse, we’re funding a war that likely cannot be won. Zelensky needs the world to believe he will win against Russia in order for them to support him. But Russia has shown that it is not deterred by loss and will keep feeding men and materials into Ukraine.

"Thanks To Leftist Corruption, U.S. Military Recruiting Is In Total Freefall","Amid the first conventional war in Europe since 1945 and China’s massive military buildup — including nuclear weapons — the U.S. military is experiencing a dangerous drop in its warfighting capability. The U.S. Army, the largest service, has only reached 40 percent of its recruiting goal with just more than three months remaining in the fiscal year.

This military decay will continue under President Joe Biden’s disastrous anti-leadership and likely will take many years of concerted effort to reverse. Further, combined with the chaotic defeat in Afghanistan, America’s ability to deter its enemies from taking hostile action is at a low not seen since the late 1970s, making a major war far more likely.

There are three growing signs of trouble: an alarming collapse in recruiting, a profoundly unserious national security leadership, and weakness in the military supply chain and procurement.

Recruiting Collapse

The military is facing its most severe staffing crisis since the advent of the all-volunteer force in 1973. In March, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced it would reduce its active-duty end strength by 0.2 percent to a little more than 2.1 million. Pentagon comptroller Michael McCord assured us that it’s “not about making the force bigger. We’re looking at making the force more capable.” But only three months later, word broke that every branch in the military is having trouble meeting its recruiting goals.

As a result of its massive recruiting shortfalls, the U.S. Army has lowered its standards, dropping requirements for recruits to have a high school diploma or GED to enlist, while relaxing tattoo restrictions to allow tattoos on hands and neck without a waiver. These two decisions will result in a less capable force with troublesome discipline issues. The Army is even offering enlistment contracts as short as two years — barely enough time to learn the basics of modern warfare.

The DoD is even reviewing more than 250 disqualifications for service, such as asthma and ADHD. With only 23 percent of Americans ages 17-24 qualified to serve in uniform without a waiver and just 9 percent of those eligible to serve even interested — the lowest since the Iraq War troop surge in 2007 — something has to give, with some experts suggesting that a draft might be needed again. Fears over not being able to meet uniformed staffing levels might have informed the seven Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who voted to require women to register for a military draft in June.

Biden’s defense officials may hope money solves the problem, but they’d be better advised to look in the mirror instead. When you openly accuse the military of being rightwing and harboring white supremacists, insist on schooling them in transgender pronoun usage, and then force them to get vaccinated for a Covid-19 virus that’s less threatening than the flu for the young and healthy military demographic, you shouldn’t be shocked that they don’t want to enlist under a leadership they neither trust nor admire.

To doublecheck that the economy wasn’t the overriding reason why recruiting is failing, I spoke with a friend who leads a large police academy in Texas. He said the classes are full of new recruits (although in Chicago, Oregon, and Washington State, areas where police are under attack, things are different). He even noted an influx of police coming into Texas from other states to escape Covid-19 vaccination requirements for public safety employees.

Profoundly Unserious Leadership

There are multiple warning flags that our civilian and senior military leadership are majoring in the minors while ignoring warfighting at our collective peril. Whether it’s the aforementioned policies or claiming climate change is an existential threat, our national security apparatus appears intent on losing its first engagement with a revanchist People’s Republic of China.

Even today’s extended 1 million barrels per day peacetime drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is aimed at the threat to Biden’s approval rating rather than the potential loss of our ability to import oil during a crisis. As of June 24, the reserve stood at 497.9 million barrels, the lowest since 1985, eight years after the program’s start. That’s a 59-day supply of imports.

The over-hyped fear of a military overrun with right-wing extremists is especially maddening as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin initiated a military-wide standdown and struggle session on the premise of false reports from CNN and NPR. These outlets claimed that the ranks of those arrested in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot were doubly overrepresented by veterans. The claim, based on three math errors, was off by about 100 percent — meaning that the share of veterans among those arrested was exactly what one would expect from any random group of American adults who were almost 90 percent men.

At the time, retired Adm. John Kirby, then Austin’s spokesman, now communications chief for the National Security Council in the White House, darkly warned, “There may be cultural issues we have to deal with here.” Cultural issues? Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen said the quiet part out loud when he worried that the National Guard soldiers sent to secure the Capitol in a symbolic show of force in 2021 were “predominantly more conservative” than Americans.

Military Procurement Weaknesses

The U.S. military supply chain has become increasingly reliant on the import of key items, such as computer chips. America makes 10 percent of the world’s computer chips with 75 percent of global production in East Asia and some 90 percent of the most advanced chips made in Taiwan.

Every Javelin missile launched in Ukraine at invading Russian forces uses a Javelin missile Command Launch Unit (CLU), and every CLU has more than 250 computer chips in it. As of mid-April, Ukraine received some 5,500 Javelin systems — CLU and missile — with reports that the United States has supplied 7,000 missiles so far, about one-third of its stockpile.

Javelin orders take 32 months to deliver, and in recent years, the United States has been buying only 1,000 Javelins per year with a maximum production rate of 6,480 per year. But the semiconductor-using industry typically has less than five days of chips on hand and it will likely take a year or more to reach the maximum production rate — assuming the chips will be available.

Unlike Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a land war in which American supplies of anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missile, and artillery, have been sent in large numbers, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would mostly involve the Navy and Air Force. Unfortunately, naval ship building and drydock repair is a glaring weak spot in our national security. America now builds fewer than 10 vessels for oceangoing trade every year — China builds more than 1,000.

In military shipbuilding, America strains to build more than four combat vessels per year. The U.S. Navy used to operate 13 shipyards — it has five now, with 14 new construction shipyards (commercial and government) lost since 1970. The U.S. Navy had 298 battle force ships in April (including the U.S.S. Constitution, built in 1797) and about another 190 support and reserve ships. Meanwhile, China has 350 warships and that number is climbing quickly.

My own decision to enlist the military in 1983 was motivated by President Ronald Reagan and his call to defeat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. In 2007, I retired as a lieutenant colonel. If I were 20 today, there’d be zero chance I’d enlist to serve under a group of people whom I thought hated me and despised my political views — and who would use my time in military service as a cross between a reeducation camp and an armed international social service agency.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/29/thanks-to-leftist-corruption-u-s-military-recruiting-is-in-total-freefall/,2022-06-29
Big Tech Should Ban TikTok App That Mines Personal Data For China,"Brendan Carr, one of the commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, is urging U.S. big tech companies to ban the popular Chinese app, TikTok, from their app stores due to data security concerns.

Carr made his case in a letter addressed to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Carr shared a copy of his letter in a tweet, stating, “TikTok is not just another video app. That’s the sheep’s clothing. It harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing. I’ve called on @Apple & @Google to remove TikTok from their app stores for its pattern of surreptitious data practices.”

TikTok, a popular app for creating short, looping videos, is owned by ByteDance, a Beijing-based internet company. Since it debuted in China under the name “Douyin” in 2016, TikTok has experienced phenomenal growth globally. It claims more than 1 billion users worldwide and is especially popular among young people aged 16-24. In the United States, the app is used by about 80 million Americans every month.

TikTok collects an enormous amount of data on its users, including IP addresses, browsing history, and biometric information. According to China’s national intelligence law, all Chinese tech companies must turn over any data they collect if the government demands it. Researchers have raised serious privacy and data security concerns about TikTok for years.

ByteDance claims that U.S. user data is safe because it is stored on U.S. soil, with a backup center in Singapore. ByteDance argues its data centers’ location ensures that neither the company’s Chinese employees nor the Chinese government have access to U.S. user data.

China Sees Everything

But a recent BuzzFeed News report, based on leaked internal TikTok meetings, shows that ByteDance’s Chinese employees have repeatedly accessed nonpublic U.S. user data. One employee of TikTok’s trust and safety department said in a September 2021 meeting that “Everything is seen in China.”

In another leaked phone call, a TikTok director referred to one Beijing-based engineer as a “master admin” who “has access to everything.” Meanwhile, TikTok’s U.S. staff “did not have permission or knowledge of how to access the data on their own.” BuzzFeed points to these leaked phone calls as evidence that ByteDance “may have misled lawmakers, its users, and the public by downplaying that data stored in the US could still be accessed by employees in China.”

In his letter to Apple and Google, Carr referred to the BuzzFeed report as the latest evidence that TikTok “is not what it appears to be on the surface..” Carr stated that TikTok “poses an unacceptable national security risk” due to its data harvesting and Beijing’s “unchecked access” to that data. One analyst has warned that the information TikTok collects today might assist China’s intelligence agencies in blackmailing Americans in the future.

App’s Invasive Mining of Personal Information

Besides the BuzzFeed report, Carr gave a list of TikTok’s other concerning data practices. For example, in 2019, TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for illegally “collecting and exposing locations of young children, as well as failing to delete information on underage children when instructed to do so.”

In 2020, TikTok reportedly took advantage of an iPhone system loophole, enabling the app to access user data, including passwords and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. A year later, TikTok agreed to pay $92 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the app had transferred a “vast quantity of private and personally identifiable user data” to China.

Carr said these examples were evidence that TikTok’s pattern of conduct and misrepresentation “put it out of compliance” with Apple and Google app stores’ policies that are supposed to protect consumer privacy and safeguard their data. Therefore, he requested both Apple and Google remove TikTok from their app stores. If the companies reject his request, Carr asked them to provide explanations by July 8.

Even More Concerns

Carr’s letter was powerful, but it didn’t go far enough. Carr only addressed the data security and privacy concerns, but researchers and human rights activists have voiced other concerns about TikTok and its parent company ByteDance for years.

TikTok has applied Beijing’s censorship to non-Chinese citizens. For instance, TikTok deleted the account of Feroza Aziz, an American TikTok star, after she posted a video criticizing Beijing’s mass internment of Uyghur Muslims. Only after media outcry did TikTok reinstate Aziz’s account. ByteDance has reportedly played an active role in condoning the Chinese Communist Party’s human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in China by collaborating “with public security bureaus across China.”

An investigative report by The Wall Street Journal found that TikTok has one of the most powerful algorithms among all social media companies. Some researchers have worried that Beijing would utilize such powerful algorithms to spread its propaganda, influence Americans’ thinking, and shape public opinion in the United States.

Ben Thompson, a Taiwan-based analyst, warned, “How much of a leap is it to think that a Party committed to ideological dominance will forever leave a route directly into the hearts and minds of millions of Americans untouched?” An example he gave is that “TikTok could promote a particular candidate or a particular issue in a particular geography, without anyone — except perhaps the candidate, now indebted to a Chinese company — knowing.”

We have already witnessed how TikTok tried to influence public opinion this year. The app was full of videos supporting Russia’s narrative after Russia invaded Ukraine. Given China and Russia’s alliance, such a Chinese and Russia propaganda campaign through a Chinese app shouldn’t be a surprise.

Many Institutions Ban TikTok

Given all these concerns about TikTok, Carr’s request of Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores is reasonable and not unprecedented. In 2020, India banned more than 100 Chinese apps, including TikTok, claiming these Chinese apps were “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting user data in an unauthorized manner.”

Multiple U.S. military branches barred members from downloading the app onto their government-issued smartphones and tablets. Some private businesses, such as Wells Fargo, also blocked their employees from downloading the app onto their company-issued devices.

Former President Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the United States through an executive order, which compelled ByteDance to start negotiating with American companies, including Microsoft and Oracle, about the possibility of divesting some of TikTok’s U.S. operations. However, shortly after President Joe Biden came into office, he revoked Trump’s order, and ByteDance quickly shelved its U.S. operation’s divesting plan.

Biden Administration’s Wrong Approach

Ignoring the various risks TikTok poses, the Biden administration has chosen to court top TikTok influencers to win support for the administration’s policies. The administration invited a TikTok influencer to the White House to convince younger Americans to get vaccinated, worked with top TikTok influencers to promote Biden’s infrastructure plan last year, and briefed top influencers on the war in Ukraine this year.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, RT America, a Russian state-sponsored network, ceased operation after being banned by major U.S. distributors. American people ought to ask the Biden administration and our big tech companies: if we don’t think the Russian propaganda machine should operate in the United States, why should we let the Chinese government’s propaganda tool operate unrestrictedly here?

Apple and Google should comply with Carr’s request and remove TikTok from their app store immediately. As for the Biden administration, rather than courting TikTok influencers, it should make ByteDance divest TikTok’s U.S. operation to an American company right away. If ByteDance refuses, the administration must ban TikTok from operating in the U.S.

As analyst Thompson wrote, “If China is on the offensive against liberalism not only within its borders but within ours, it is in liberalism’s interest to cut off a vector that has taken root precisely because it is so brilliantly engineered to give humans exactly what they want.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/05/big-tech-should-ban-invasive-tiktok-app-that-mines-personal-data-for-china/,2022-07-05
Biden Doubles Down On Forcing Americans To Fund Europe’s Security,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s secretary general confirmed NATO is boosting its forces in Europe to “well over 300,000” from the current 40,000, a 650 percent increase. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claims it’s to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Setting aside the obvious ridiculousness of NATO boosting a deterrence force, however, at the very same time Russia is failing to conquer even Ukraine and is increasingly bogged down, such euphemisms from NATO are jarring. Everyone understands this means U.S. taxpayers will carry an additional burden for European security.

Consider the details: President Biden will deploy additional troops to Romania and the Baltic states, establish and maintain the permanent Fifth Army Corps in Poland, send two F-35 squadrons to the United Kingdom and air defenses to Germany and Italy, and increase the number of destroyers stationed in Spain from four to six.

The new additions are so bizarrely out of proportion to the threat that it provoked one of the most hawkish Republicans, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to question why Biden is reinforcing Europe at the cost of the Pacific: “Russia’s military is in no condition to invade anyone else right now and its China & North Korea who are threatening military aggression,” Rubio tweeted.

In a time of inflation and with a rapid Chinese military build-up in the Indo-Pacific, Biden is doubling down on providing security for Europe when the United States should be “burden-shifting,” especially with relatively finite naval assets and as rich European economic powerhouses like Germany already free-ride on American taxpayers.

The question of Germany is crucial in this regard. As former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby recently tweeted, “It’s a commonplace in American discussion that German foreign policy has been ‘naive.’ Well, Germany spends almost nothing on defense and has peacefully become the economic hegemon of Europe. Meantime we’ve had failed Middle East wars and enabled China’s rise. Who’s naive?”

Colby is, of course, correct. The idea that German foreign policy is derived from pacifism and war guilt, not one of the cleverest instances of strategic “buck passing,” is perhaps the most debilitating assumption of Anglo-American grand strategies. It’s a misjudgment that German strategists are more than happy to see continue, because they are smart.

Only nine countries reach the required defense spending within NATO, even after four years of President Trump pushing and an invasion of Ukraine.

When the richest countries in the richest continent can make two other external maritime great powers such as the United Kingdom and the United States, neither part of the mainland, pay for their security, it can be considered a major win—for the continent.

A recent paper titled “Woke Imperium” helps explain this development. In a normal world, a decimated Russian invasion force bogged down in Ukraine would be an opportunity for further retrenchment from Europe, letting the rich Europeans share their own security burden, it observes. Instead, we see a doubling down on rhetoric about the “liberal international order,” promoted by the same NGOcracy that led to wasting trillions in Afghanistan to allegedly ensure girl’s schools and democratic institutions, as the paper notes:

“The rise of a ‘woke’ activist-driven, social justice-oriented politics—particularly among the members of academia, media, and the professional managerial class—has provided the latest ideological justification for interventionism, and it has become readily adopted by the U.S. foreign policy establishment. These groups now have an even greater level of symbiotic relationship with state actors,” the paper states, adding, “the emerging hegemonic posture and its moral imperialism are at odds with a sober and realistic appraisal of U.S. interests on the world stage, as they create untenable, maximalist, and utopian goals that clash with the concrete realities on which U.S. grand strategy must be based.”

The paper goes on to argue that the “liberal Atlanticist tendency” to drive “moralism and social engineering” may well create a backlash around the world, creating “new forms of anti-Westernism.” Put simply, U.S. foreign policy is now completely utopian, disregarding geography and interests and betting trillions on amorphous aims such as ensuring rights in Ukraine and further subsidizing Europe, all to maintain some mythical liberal international order that was never very orderly nor international to begin with.

Whether and how long Americans are willing to accept this bipartisan internationalist edifice, at the cost of declining living standards and rising crime at home, remains to be seen.

"With Shinzo Abe’s Death, Japan And Taiwan Have Lost A Strong Advocate","Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated at a campaign event by a Japanese national last Friday. As the longest-serving PM in Japan’s history and one of the most consequential ones, the effects of his death have already been felt worldwide. For one of Abe’s legacies was advocating for the security of his country and neighboring Taiwan.

Known as a staunch anti-communist, Abe advocated for Japan’s leading role in defending democratic values in the Asia Pacific region to counter China’s growing military power and global ambition. He worked well with President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump and made Japan the most reliable U.S. partner in the Asia-Pacific. He once said, “Japan can keep the power balance of this region if Japan and the U.S. join forces.”

Abe was credited with introducing the concept of the “free and open Indo-Pacific” after China militarized the South China Sea through building artificial islands, and he was instrumental in forming Quad, an informal alliance including the United States, Japan, Australia, and India. All four nations are aligned in their shared concerns about China’s expanding military and its growing willingness to challenge democratic values.

The Quad held its first joint military exercise in November 2020. When Joe Biden became president of the United States, he threw many of Trump’s foreign policy initiatives out the window, but he kept the U.S. involvement with Quad. The fact that both Trump and Biden embraced Quad was a testament to Abe’s vision and influence.

Taiwan’s Ties to Japan

After stepping down as prime minister in late 2020, Abe didn’t fade into history’s background. He remained the most influential political leader in Japan and continued to serve as the head of the largest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and was a trusted adviser to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Abe had become more outspoken, especially on the Taiwan issue, as the island has had to endure growing intimidation and harassment from China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

In December 2021, at a forum organized by a Taiwanese think tank, Abe said, “A stronger Taiwan, a thriving Taiwan, and a Taiwan that guarantees freedom and human rights are also in Japan’s interests. Of course, this is also in the interests of the whole world.” Abe noted that the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands — which China calls the Diaoyu Islands and says are Chinese territories — are only 62 miles away from Taiwan. He worried that if China invaded Taiwan, Japan’s territories could be the next target of China’s PLA. Thus, Abe warned, “A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, an emergency for the Japan-U.S. alliance. People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should never have a misunderstanding in recognizing this.”

After Russia invaded Ukraine, Abe called on the Biden administration to abandon the U.S. government’s long-held “strategic ambiguity” position on Taiwan, which doesn’t commit the United States to Taiwan’s defense. “The people of Taiwan share our universal values, so I think the U.S. should firmly abandon its ambiguity,” Abe said.

He further pointed out that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would endanger Japan’s national security because “to secure wide air superiority” in an operation against Taiwan, China “would also cover Japan’s airspace. [China] would also conduct operations in and above the waters, so this would affect Japan’s territorial waters, or at least our exclusive economic zone.”

Most world leaders have remained muted on the Taiwan issue out of fear of Beijing’s economic coercion and military might. Abe stood out on the world stage due to his unequivocal public support of Taiwan and warning of China’s aggression.

Strengthening Japan’s Defenses

Abe also advocated for other ways to shore up Japan’s defense against China. He started a debate on housing American nuclear weapons on Japanese soil under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s nuclear-sharing arrangement, an idea first brought up by Trump. As the only country attacked by atomic weapons in the past, hosting nuclear weapons had been a non-starter in Japan. But the Ukraine crisis has compelled the Japanese public to contemplate the unthinkable.

While not ready to discuss nuclear-sharing with the United States, PM Kishida recently announced that Japan would “fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities within the next five years.” He promised to dramatically increase Japan’s defense budget from 1 percent of gross domestic product to 2 percent. Kishida also pledged to provide at least $2 billion in aid to Indo-Pacific countries. It’s fair to say that Kishida probably would not have taken such bold steps without the backing from Abe.

Abe’s advocacy for strengthening Japan’s military and open support for Taiwan made him a target of Chinese nationalists. Some of them celebrated his death last Friday.

Abe’s Domestic Policies

Abe came from a political dynasty in Japan. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served as Japan’s prime minister from 1957 to 1960, and his father, Shintaro Abe, served as Japan’s foreign minister in the early 1980s.

Shinzo Abe first became Japan’s prime minister in 2006, resigning after a short tenure due to health issues. He became Japan’s prime minister again in 2012. After serving for eight years, he had to resign in late 2020, again due to health issues.

Most observers agree that Abe’s foreign policy was much more successful than his domestic one. His efforts to revive Japan’s economy achieved mixed results. For example, his economic programs, known as “Abenomics,” couldn’t get Japan out of its long stagnation despite early successes (the lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic didn’t help either).

On national defense, Abe failed to revise Article 9 of Japan’s constitution, which was adopted after World War II and aimed to prevent the nation from establishing any “war potential.” Abe did, however, manage to introduce a reinterpretation of the constitution. With legislative approval, such a reinterpretation allowed Japan to increase defense spending and the nation’s self-defense forces to cooperate closely with the U.S. military outside Japan. Abe’s reinterpretation was criticized by Japan’s pacifist faction and neighboring countries such as China and South Korea — both nations suffered enormous loss of lives and destruction during their wars with Japan, so animosity lingers on. But Abe believed that Japan must strengthen its military to counter the aggressions from both China and North Korea.

With Abe’s death, both Japan and Taiwan lost an influential advocate. The region’s peace and security face more uncertainty now.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/11/with-shinzo-abes-death-japan-and-taiwan-have-lost-a-strong-advocate/,2022-07-11
Here's Why Media Don't Want You To Know About Huge Global Protests,"If you skim the front pages of major corporate news outlets, you’ll find no mention of the economic protests raging in Spain, Morocco, Greece, and the United Kingdom.

On The Washington Post homepage these days, you’ll find headlines such as, “How To Deal With A Chatty Coworker Who Won’t Get Out Of Your Office,” but you won’t find mention of the more than 100,000 people protesting in Madrid. You’ll find the story of a gay union entitled, “What’s Two ‘Yentas’ Plus One Senator? A Lifetime Together” at The New York Times, but you won’t see a single heading on the more than 10,000 protesters in Athens. Corporate media has largely glossed over the tens of thousands of farmers in the Netherlands who clogged up roadways and distributions centers by holding Canadian-trucker-convoy-style demonstrations to protest radical climate policies.

According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which records protests worldwide, 11 countries are currently seeing protests of more than 1,000 people in response to the rising cost of living and other economic woes in 2022. As of July 5, Carnegie had recorded protests of more than 120,000 people in France, 100,000 in Spain, 10,000 in Greece, 10,000 in Kazakhstan, 10,000 in Sri Lanka, 10,000 in India, 5,000 in Iran, 5,000 in Peru, 1,000 people in Argentina, 1,000 in Morocco, and 1,000 in the U.K.

When vaccine passports were being implemented, protests took place around the world – but there was hardly any coverage from the media.



Due to the cost of living crisis, protests are happening around the world – but again, the media turns a blind eye.

Many of the French protesters took to the streets on May Day for salary increases and against President Emmanuel Macron’s increase of the retirement age. Fifty-four people were reportedly arrested in Paris after some demonstrations turned violent. France’s economy, Europe’s third-largest, shrank in the first quarter of 2022, and in June, inflation shot up 5.8 percent compared to last year. Protesters also held demonstrations in March, with some complaining they had lost 15 to 20 percent of their purchasing power. Meanwhile, France’s answer to inflation? Keep spending; the country is throwing $20.4 billion at the problem.

In Spain, with gas subsidies, direct grants, and an increase in the minimum wage, the socialist-leaning government has seen only rising inflation rates (10.2 percent), and the accompanying price hikes are driving thousands of people onto the streets to protest. The country is finding out the hard way what a 40 percent reliance on renewable energy will do to the labor market. With its high unemployment rate at 13.65 percent as of the first quarter of 2022, labor shortages are raising prices on staple grocery items to an almost 30-year high. Thousands of demonstrators protested in March for relief in the form of tax cuts.

Meanwhile, it’s no surprise that any supply issues, aggravated or initiated by the Russia-Ukraine war, would burden Greece’s weakened economy that only just emerged from a decade-long crisis in 2018 to be sent right back by Covid shutdowns in 2020. In April, thousands gathered at a labor union-organized rally outside parliament in protest of inflation, which followed a February demonstration where about 10,000 people showed up to protest electricity prices that had leaped 56 percent, fuel prices that had jumped 21.6 percent, and natural gas prices that had skyrocketed 156 percent in January.

In India, a country locked in a vicious cycle of going into debt to pay off interest of former debts, the increasing cost of living is racking the country. In March, an estimated 50 million workers participated in a two-day strike to protest the loss of jobs and income, with communist groups organizing rallies in May decrying the high rate of inflation.

The socialist government in Argentina that led the country to default seven times and produced the largest decline in the relative standard of living in the world since 1900 is trying to do something new. On Monday, Argentina’s new economy minister Silvina Batakis announced her plan to cut the fiscal deficit — a proposal more than a thousand Argentines are protesting.

Decades of government spending and faulty economic policies have led to Argentina’s inflation rate growing to 58 percent. Prices are liquid and through the roof, with iPhones costing six months’ rent and a two-hour plane ticket equaling the cost of a month’s college tuition. Batakis plans to hold Argentina to the terms of a $44 billion debt deal it made earlier this year with the International Monetary Fund. Thousands of Argentines meanwhile flocked to protest against the economic hardships felt by the country upon cutting spending and took up banners crying for Argentina’s separation from the IMF.

The United Kingdom is suffering from a high 9.1 percent inflation rate as of May, and many are tired of the government’s response. Brits flocked out in February to protest rising costs of living, with demonstrations held in at least 25 towns and cities and signs reading, “tax the rich” and “freeze prices not the poor.” The U.K.’s inflation rate was already at 5.4 percent in January of this year due in part to the 2020 Covid shutdowns, but it has since almost doubled, largely due to the EU’s sanctions on Russian oil. In June, thousands marched down central London in protest, wanting the government to boost its welfare response.

Still reeling from the worst drought it has had in 40 years, Morocco is seeing price spikes on even the most basic goods. Thousands of Moroccans joined protests in February to decry the increasing cost of living, with unions staging more demonstrations in April. The country has high unemployment rates and large public debt, along with a heavy reliance on imports.

Aside from a scant headline here and there, America’s most popular news providers, The Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, and NBC, did not cover these protests, despite the French and Spanish protests being 10 to 100 times larger than the protests these corporate media giants did report.

None of these four major outlets wrote a single line on the protests of more than 100,000 demonstrators in Spain, more than 10,000 in Greece, more than 1,000 in Morocco, and more than 1,000 in the U.K. The New York Times published one lone article on the strike in India, where an estimated 50 million people walked off the job. The Washington Post has two small articles on the Argentinian protests of more than 1,000 as inflation appears set to hit 70 percent, and it has reported once on the May Day protests in France where more than 120,000 people protested government pension reforms. NBC mentioned the May Day protests once in a world report. This is the entire 2022 coverage by these media giants of these countries’ protests over economic turmoil.

Of these 11 countries, only four made any major headlines. The corporate press oftentimes only highlights these economic protests when they get so loud they can no longer be ignored, as we saw with Kazakhstan’s kill order to quell protests and the Sri Lankans’ attack on their president’s home. Over the weekend, the biased media finally began covering the Sri Lanka protests that are over 10,000 people strong — but only because footage of demonstrators swarming the president’s residence by the thousands on Saturday went viral.

Corporate media won’t talk about the rest of these protests because the countries are struggling from economically disastrous policies akin to President Joe Biden’s. Any show of economic turmoil in EU member states could be traced back to EU sanctions on Russia or green energy failures, which would fly in the face of the corporate media’s agenda. Many of these countries have inflationary monetary policies.

The leftist media will tell you about Sri Lanka, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Peru, however, but only to bolster its pro-Ukraine/anti-Russia narrative that denies the realities of war to promote Biden’s efforts to empty our pockets and replenish Ukraine’s.

In its treatment of the Kazakhstan protests, The Washington Post made sure to mention the country’s relationship with Russia. The Times’ articles on the Sri Lanka protests framed the economic downturns in terms of problems stemming from Russia’s invasion and ignored Sri Lanka’s Green Deal ban on chemical fertilizer that ultimately crashed its economy. Both CNN’s coverage of protests in Iran and NBC’s reports of those in Peru likewise stressed the Russia-Ukraine war as the cause for economic turmoil.

The media only highlight these world protests when they grow too big to ignore or when the facts can be skewed toward their preferring narratives. Cherry-picking which protests to highlight gives media cover to paint them as isolated incidents in non-Western countries instead of a worldwide trend showing the consequences of embracing left-wing policies. After all, Biden is making the same blunders in the United States, and corporate media can’t have Americans connecting those dots.

The U.S. labor market is in shambles. Inflation has skyrocketed to a 40-year high at 9.1 percent. The Biden administration is drawing down our emergency oil reserves, shipping it overseas to nations that can’t function on their “Green Energy” policies anymore than we can. Irony alert: The oil will go through a European pipeline despite Biden citing climate conservation to shut down our own Keystone pipeline.

Discontent with these policy failures is triggering massive protests all over the world. Just don’t expect to read all about it in the New York Times.

Sri Lanka Crisis Shows Consequences Of Elites' Green Revolution,"Sri Lanka, a small island nation in South East Asia, is on the verge of total political and economic collapse after its president’s “green” policies have brought famine to the island’s 21 million people.

From the 1970s to 2020, with the help of synthetic fertilizers, Sri Lanka had become self-sufficient in rice production. However, Sri Lanka’s government fell under the spell of the “green” revolution promoted by Western liberal elites. In a now-deleted article published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), then Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe vowed to make his country “rich by 2025,” partially by adopting WEF-sponsored “climate change” initiatives.

Advised by the Rockefeller Foundation, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised to transition the nation’s agriculture industry to organic farming within ten years. In April 2021, he banned “the importation and use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and order[ed] the country’s 2 million farmers to go organic,” according to Foreign Policy magazine. The Western green revolutionists were so pleased that they bestowed Sri Lanka with a near-perfect Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score of 98, much higher than the United States’ score of 51.

But Sri Lanka’s adoption of green policies brought nothing but disasters. Its rice production has dropped more than 50 percent, while domestic rice prices have increased more than 80 percent. Once sufficient in rice production, the nation has been “forced to import $450 million worth of rice.” In the words of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sri Lanka is experiencing “a government-created famine reminiscent of Mao.”

In addition, the ban on synthetic fertilizer and pesticides also affected the nation’s tea production, a primary export. Compounded by the effect of falling tourism after Covid-19 lockdowns, the nation’s foreign reserves shrunk. Sri Lanka’s government eventually was forced to lift its ban on fertilizer and pesticides when prices of both had reached historical highs.

With its foreign reserves dwindling close to zero, Sri Lanka’s government struggled to import necessities, such as food, fertilizers, and fuels. It also has had difficulty paying back its foreign loans to finance the nation’s infrastructure. Its currency value dropped, and the country defaulted on its debt obligations.

The Sri Lankan people, angry and hungry, staged protests and stormed both the president’s residence and prime minister’s office. President Rajapaksa resigned and fled the country this week.

Sri Lanka is the tip of the iceberg of how “green” policies promoted by Western liberal elites have brought miseries and instability worldwide.

Food Security Depends on Energy

Liberal politicians and climate activists in the West have failed to appreciate how much food security depends on oil and gas. For example, about 80 percent of synthetic fertilizers are made out of natural gas. The wide adoption of synthetic fertilizers was the main reason farmers could feed a global population of 7.9 billion while available farmlands were shrinking. Farmers also need pesticides sourced from petroleum to protect crops and control weeds, insects, and diseases.

Despite the vital role energy plays in food security, many European countries have closed down coal plants and nuclear power generators, cut natural gas production, and banned fracking, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. According to the Wall Street Journal, “mere 15 years ago, countries in the European Union produced more gas than Russia exported.” But Europe’s “green” revolution has made it vulnerable to Russia’s energy and Putin’s aggression. In the U.S., the Biden administration has waged a similar war on fossil fuels, including canceling the Keystone Pipeline project.

Ukraine Crisis Worsened Existing Problems

These wrong-headed policies had driven up the prices of all energy resources that modern farming depends on, from diesel to natural gas and petroleum, long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine increased energy prices and further exasperated the global food security problem.

Russia and Ukraine provide about a third of the world’s wheat and barley exports. In addition, Ukraine is responsible for 14 percent of corn exports and about half the world’s sunflower oil. Russia’s invasion has disrupted Ukraine’s agricultural production and halted exports as Ukrainian ports are under the Russian military’s blockade. Since Russia is also one of the largest fertilizer suppliers in the world, Putin “temporarily” suspended fertilizer exports as a retaliation to the West-led economic sanctions.

Farmers worldwide responded to rising operating costs, from energy to fertilizer, by cutting back production and using fewer fertilizers and pesticides. The downstream effects include lower crop yield, reduced food supply, and higher prices for all food, including corn, which is also essential feed for live stock. Higher prices of corn will translate to higher prices of meat, milk, and other food products. Rising operating costs may also drive some farmers out of business. Doomberg, a financial research site with extensive reporting on the relationship between energy policies and farming, warns that farmers “are on the brink” and “we are at the onset of a global famine of historic proportions.”

Warnings of Food Shortages

The chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Maximo Torero, tweeted, “Global wheat and barley prices went up 31% over the past year. In Feb, food prices were at a record high due to high demand, transportation costs & port disruptions. Volatile natural gas prices sent fertilizer prices soaring. All could lead millions more to face severe hunger.” Similarly, Bloomberg analyst Alexis Maxwell called food shortages the next “slow-moving disaster” that would hit the world. Even President Joe Biden warned Americans to prepare for food shortages and higher prices.

Another sign that a worldwide food shortage is approaching is China’s hoarding food. According to Bloomberg, China will “hold 69% of the world’s corn reserves, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat” by mid-2022.

Doubling Down on Green Revolution

Yet, despite the looming food shortages, liberal politicians and climate activists in the West have chosen to double down on their green revolution. At its recent summit, NATO integrated climate change into its statement of purpose and committed to reducing its military’s greenhouse gas emissions.

Rather than developing fossil fuels at home, European nations are preparing to ration energy. Germany is sticking to its plan to shut down three remaining nuclear power plants while considering bringing back wood burning this winter. The same European countries refusing to fund oil and gas development in Africa are rushing to buy natural gas from the continent. Their hypocrisy has left millions of impoverished Africans without access to natural gas and relying on “black-market kerosene and diesel to light wood stoves and power electricity generators.”

The Biden administration continues its war on fossil fuels by canceling oil and gas lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, essentially “removing millions of acres from possible drilling as U.S. gas prices reach record highs,” the AP reported. This week, President Biden travels to Saudi Arabia to beg the Gulf State to produce more oil. At home, his administration is incentivizing farmers to produce more soybeans to make biodiesel, even though soybeans are an important food source for human and animal feed and there are cooking oil shortages and food shortages around the world.

The researchers at Doomberg asked, “In the face of a global energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, food shortages, and rampant inflation, does it make sense to be redirecting so many acres of valuable cropland to make renewable diesel, a fuel we can easily and directly drill for domestically?”

From ancient Rome to today’s Sri Lanka, history has taught us that revolutions erupted and regimes fell when people were hungry. The looming worldwide food crisis may not hit the U.S. as severely as other parts of the world, but we are not exempt from empty shelves and food shortages if the Biden administration’s green revolution continues.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/15/sri-lanka-crisis-shows-the-damning-consequences-of-western-elites-green-revolution/,2022-07-15
Sri Lanka Is First To Topple In Globalists' Green Energy House Of Cards,"For a year, the Biden administration told Americans inflation wasn’t real. Then it was “transitory.” Then it was “sticky.” Then inflation was miraculously “real” but perfectly expected as a result of Covid-19 workplace lockdowns. Then it was an unfortunate but “necessary cost” for patriotic Americans to pay in defense of Ukraine against Russian aggression. Now inflation has risen to an annual rate of 9.1 percent, the highest in more than 40 years.

Tucker Carlson has been outlining how Joe Biden’s Green New Deal energy policies — not Russia’s war in Ukraine or Covid-19’s economic fallout — are directly responsible for our current economic crisis. In following the World Economic Forum’s Build Back Better socialist blueprint for transitioning the economy from one relying on the hydrocarbon energies of oil, coal, and natural gas to one based on insufficient supplies of wind and solar energies, manufacturing and transportation costs have skyrocketed.

Add to this destabilizing energy shift the WEF and Green New Deal’s concerted efforts to shift the global food supply from one based on high-yield, fertilizer-intensive crop farming and traditional cattle and poultry production to a new “sustainable” diet of insects and lab-grown synthetic meats, and it is clear that the Build Back Better agenda touches every part of an individual’s daily life. In one fell swoop, Davos devotees are attempting to overhaul both the energy sources undergirding the global economy and the energy sources that fuel every human being.

One of the principal effects of this forced paradigm shift in energy and food production is today’s runaway inflation. If the supplies of relatively inexpensive sources of hydrocarbon energy are reduced on the global market, then everything dependent on hydrocarbon energy increases in price. From the operational overhead required to keep commodity and manufacturing plants running to the international shipping and transcontinental transport costs required to move finished products across the world, everything becomes more expensive.

At each stage of the process of extracting raw materials, producing a product for market, and putting that product in a consumer’s home, rising “green” energy costs cascade to create skyrocketing inflation. Likewise, when agricultural and livestock farming are heavily regulated in accordance with Green New Deal “climate change” goals, then not only does food become more expensive, it also becomes more scarce. Inflation and food insecurity are the natural results.

The Great Reset, however, is not occurring in a vacuum. Unsuspecting citizens may be the guinea pigs forced to endure the World Economic Forum’s agenda, but they do not lack agency of their own. Hunger and loss of savings tend to fracture societies, and not surprisingly, chaos and carnage are now on the rise.

In Sri Lanka, the costs of food and fuel have gotten so high that the island country has nearly collapsed. The president has fled, the prime minister has promised to resign, the socialist nation is in a state of emergency, and fed-up citizens have taken over much of the capital. It is the starkest warning yet to the Build Back Better zealots how devastating for ordinary citizens their forced experiment in social engineering has become.

In the Netherlands, farmers protesting government plans to regulate their livelihoods out of existence and seize their farms have fought back by blocking main thoroughfares with their tractors and keeping supermarket shelves relatively bare. Already, similar protests have popped up in Italy, Poland, and Germany.

Castro-loving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may have succeeded in using the iron fists of government force and bank account seizures to dismantle Canadian truckers’ Freedom Convoy protests against experimental vaccine mandates earlier this year, but the current spate of public demonstrations against historic food and fuel costs show few signs of being similarly squashed.

While Germany prepares to restrict home heating at night and ration hot water, some industry leaders are already warning that “social peace is in great danger.” If tempers are running hot today, they are certain to go nuclear in the near future, as French and German leaders have warned their populations to “prepare for a total cut-off of Russian gas” that promises to exacerbate business bankruptcies and extend personal economic ruin. Only adding to the uncertainty of this approaching cataclysm, Europe’s border forces are reportedly “bracing” for “waves” of hungry illegal immigrants heading their way during what is inarguably transforming into a global food crisis.

Riots, famines, societal collapse, and cultural invasion — the globalists’ Great Reset agenda has created the perfect storm of economic insecurity and national instability.

All of this leads to an important question: If this Build Back Better project to demolish and reconstruct the West’s economic foundations ends up blowing up right in the globalists’ faces, what will they do next?

In Sri Lanka, the president hightailed it out of town and headed for paradise in the nearby Maldives. If Europe descends into conflict or outright rebellion, however, where will the World Economic Forum’s leaders hide? Is there someplace left in the world still unscathed from the predictable consequences of their disastrous actions?

Prince Harry Spews Climate Hypocrisy In United Nations Address,"Image Credit InsideEditon/YouTube

Prince-in-name-only Harry Windsor spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Monday as part of the UN’s honoring the late Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s freedom fighter and president.

Evidently, it was too much for Harry to stay focused on Mandela’s heroic life story, a man who overcame long-time political imprisonment to become the first black leader of the Republic of South Africa. That is plenty for a 15-minute speech.

Rather, he preened about democracy and climate change, about which he knows little and is disqualified from lecturing, considering his own lifestyle.

“From the horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of constitutional rights here in the United States, we are witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom,” Harry observed, in a not-subtle reference to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision on abortion, issued last month.

Thus, did he equate the cruel Russian war against Ukraine to the Court’s overturning Roe v. Wade, the 49-year-old ruling that abrogated 46 state laws to instead allow unfettered abortion.

Lost on Harry is that the Supreme Court returned abortion policy to the democratic process in state legislatures, that is, determined by elected officials – the same as it exists in Britain and throughout Europe. That democratic process has resulted in most European nations having restrictions on abortion at earlier stages of pregnancy (from 10 to 14 weeks), than in the U.S. during the Roe abortion era.

Throughout her 70-year reign, Queen Elizabeth II had more dignity in her royal fingernail than her virtue-signaling grandson. Attacking her nation’s closest global ally was unthinkable, considering her own witness to the blood and treasure sacrificed by Americans for democracy and freedom.

Then there was climate change, one of the vanity projects of Harry and his wife, Meghan, which he claimed was “wreaking havoc on the planet” as evidenced by “the water rising all around us.”

“The right thing to do is not up for debate, and neither is the science,” declared the prince. “The only question is whether we will be brave enough and wise enough to do what is necessary.”

Typical of wealthy and pampered climate alarmists, Harry provided neither science nor reality about this ubiquitous climate “havoc.” Rather, he echoed his fellow elites and political hucksters to squash debate — one of the central features of democracy and freedom — obtuse to irony or self-awareness.

Attempting to stop the planet’s climate from ever-changing is a colossal fool’s errand that brings serious drawbacks. They include extensive mining required for electric vehicle battery components; fossil fuels to manufacture and maintain solar panels and wind turbines; the toxic residue from their disposal; and despoiling enormous virgin land mass necessary to approach displacing oil and gas, to name a few. Moreover, large industrial nations, China, India, et.al., are not cooperating in Harry’s crusade and that of the Climate Industrial Complex of celebrities, bureaucrats, and NGOs, which makes the entirety of this agenda fruitless.

Taking Harry’s climate narcissism at face value, are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex themselves “brave and wise enough to do what is necessary” to curtail climate change?

Harry and Meghan could start by relinquishing their 16-room mansion in the Montecito enclave of Santa Barbara, California, and downsize to accommodate their two maximum children, still without needing bunk beds. Last year the couple received an award from the group Population Matters for not having more children to add to the planet’s CO2 emissions. Then why power a mansion large enough to house a Cub Scout pack?

As to air travel, the Duke and Duchess long ago dissed the plea from Friends of the Earth to forgo private planes. No bravery or wisdom from the faux royals there, either.

It is fitting Prince Harry is no longer a working member of the British Royal Family. He has long since become a self-serving embarrassment in his myriad of pursuits. Harry and Megan will press on hungry for attention and relevance, ever impervious, as they retain their vapid titles denoting a pretend monarchical fiefdom eight time zones away from them.

Of Course Neocons Don't Want To Talk About Corruption In Ukraine,"Americans who even casually followed the news in the fall of 2020 probably know that Ukraine was infamously corrupt long before the United States sent the country $54 billion in aid after the Russian invasion in February. They might not know much else about Ukraine, but they know it’s the kind of place where just being the son of the vice president of the United States can get you an $83,000 monthly paycheck for sitting on the board of an energy company.

No one knows this better than Ukrainians themselves, who have to put up with a level of official corruption on par with countries like Mexico and Gabon. Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Ukraine 122 out of 180 countries worldwide, and the second most corrupt country in Europe — right after Russia.

But talking about any of this publicly is a big problem for establishment neocons in Washington because it invites uncomfortable questions about the U.S. role in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Just ask Ukrainian-born Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., who lived in Ukraine until she was 22 and has been back six times since the Russian invasion. Spartz probably understands what’s happening in Ukraine better than anyone else in Congress, and yet Republican House leaders now say they regret giving her such a prominent platform to speak out against the war.

Why? Because she’s asking hard questions about corruption among some of Ukraine’s top officials, as well as raising totally reasonable concerns about U.S. oversight of the billions of dollars and unprecedented amount of weaponry we’ve been pouring into the country.

Such questions undermine the neocon narrative that Ukraine is a noble beacon of democracy and freedom, and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a Churchillian figure whose integrity and policies cannot be questioned. That narrative is what the neocons are relying on to prolong the war with indefinite financing and use the conflict as a way to punish Russia.

Narrative integrity notwithstanding, the reality of Ukrainian corruption and the complete absence of U.S. accountability aren’t concerns that can simply be waved away, no matter what paper-thin talking points Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is spouting this week. The fact is, there’s plenty of evidence that Zelensky’s government is deeply corrupt, that he has surrounded himself with officials who served in previous corrupt Ukrainian governments, and that maybe Ukraine isn’t the kind of place the United States should be flooding with tens of billions of dollars in cash and weapons.

The backstory is that on Friday, Politico reported Republican House leaders (who of course remained anonymous) are “coming to regret” elevating Spartz as an authority on Ukraine after she criticized both Zelensky and President Joe Biden for “playing politics” with the war, and called on Congress to “establish proper oversight of critical infrastructure and delivery of weapons and aid.” Hers is a reasonable request, of course — especially after the debacle in Afghanistan last fall, when some $80 billion in U.S. military hardware wound up in the hands of the Taliban following the disastrous U.S. withdrawal.

Spartz also issued a letter asking the Biden administration to brief Congress on Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, widely considered to be the second most powerful person in Ukraine. Spartz said Yermak, a former media lawyer and movie producer with close ties to Russia, “raises many concerns with a variety of people in the United States and internationally.” She also noted Yermak’s appointment of Oleh Tatarov, who served as the head of the main investigative department of the Interior Ministry under former President Viktor Yanukovych. Recall that Yanukovych’s tenure was marked by stupendous levels of corruption and ended when he fled to Russia during the Euromaidan revolution in February 2014.

Tatarov, though, stayed in Ukraine and was appointed by Zelensky as his deputy chief of staff in August 2020. That December, he was charged with bribery by Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), but the case was dropped after then-Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova twice replaced the prosecutors in charge and then pulled the case from the NABU and gave it to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which dropped the charges.

Zelensky faced intense pressure to fire Tatarov but refused. According to the Kyiv Independent, by the time news broke of his acquittal, about a month before the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, Tatarov had “become the symbol of Zelensky’s tolerance of corruption in his inner circle.”

Now comes news that Zelensky has fired Venediktova, the prosecutor general who obstructed and effectively destroyed the case against Tatarov, as well as the head of the SBU, a man named Ivan Bakanov. In a speech Sunday night, Zelensky said the dismissals were a response to a large number of high treason investigations involving law enforcement personnel, including dozens of people who remain in occupied territory and, according to Zelensky, are working against the state.

Tatarov, though, wasn’t fired. He’s now in charge of anti-corruption efforts in Zelensky’s office.

Like everything else in Ukraine, there’s no way to know what’s actually happening there, but a few red flags should give American readers pause. For one thing, anonymous U.S. officials quoted by The New York Times would like you to know that everything is fine; there’s nothing to see here. They told the Times the dismissals “reflect Mr. Zelensky’s efforts to put more experienced leaders in key security positions.”

But you would think after nearly five months of waging an all-out defensive war against Russia, a war that Zelensky has characterized as a fight for national survival, the most experienced leaders would already be in key positions such as prosecutor general and head of domestic intelligence. Why weren’t they?

Bakanov, the now-fired head of the SBU, is a childhood friend of Zelensky and a former director of a television production company started by Zelensky and some of his friends. Why was a media executive appointed to lead the Security Service of Ukraine in the first place?

And why is Tatarov, of all people, in charge of anti-corruption efforts? As Spartz noted in her letter, Tatarov has delayed the appointment of an independent anti-corruption prosecutor for more than a year, rendering the NABU — the agency that brought corruption charges against him in 2020 and was still actively investigating him when he assumed his current post — incapacitated.

The dismissal of Bakanov also raises questions given the rumors that Tatarov had been spearheading an effort to replace him with an old colleague from the Yanukovych administration, Vasyl Malyuk, who was fired from the SBU a year ago but now, as a result of Bakanov’s firing, is running the agency.

A lot of questions here, and even at first glance it’s pretty clear that Ukrainian politics is a viper’s nest of corruption and graft. Just don’t ask any questions about it or demand any oversight, because that might get in the way of the neocons’ Ukraine agenda in Washington. The whole thing stinks, and it tells you everything you need to know about how much the Washington establishment cares about corruption in Ukraine and oversight of the $54 billion we’re sending in aid and weapons.

Instead of casting aspersions on Spartz, her Republican colleagues should be amplifying her concerns and demanding more oversight from the Biden administration. At the very least, if they disagree with her and think everything is fine in Ukraine, they should say so, and make an argument.

But they won’t, because digging into Ukraine’s corruption problems could jeopardize their plans to prolong the war in Ukraine with unlimited financing and turn it into a U.S. proxy war against Russia. The neocons in Washington all know, deep down, what most Americans figured out back in the fall of 2020: Any country where an energy company pays Hunter Biden $83,000 a month to sit on its board is mindbogglingly corrupt and has been for a very long time. It’s just that they don’t care.

Attacks On Rep. Victoria Spartz Should Pique Your Curiosity,"Everyone should read my colleague John Daniel Davidson’s excellent piece detailing Rep. Victoria Spartz and her claims about Ukrainian corruption.

Whatever you make of Spartz’s contentions, the very fact that a Republican House Foreign Affairs Committee member is given anonymity to smear a colleague who is bringing up issues the media should be asking legislators about is curious. If Spartz is spreading conspiracies or fabrications, a Republican House Committee member should be able to publicly debunk those claims—otherwise cynics may get the idea someone is trying to hide something.

One probable reason for hiding behind anonymity to level these attacks is that any assurance of Ukraine’s virtuousness could easily backfire. Ukraine was one of the most corrupt in Europe before the Russian invasion, and there’s no reason to believe it has suddenly reformed as tens of billions of dollars flow in. A 2018 report ranked Ukraine around 130 of 180 countries and territories in corruption, in the vicinity of Gambia, Iran, and Myanmar on the list. Pointing out this reality doesn’t make you pro-Putin—that gangster’s country is slotted in one space lower than Ukraine.

If Volodymyr Zelensky’s confidants—namely, Andriy Yermak and Oleh Tatarov—are trusted stewards of seemingly unlimited aid, it does nothing to diminish our support for “democracy” to ask for more coordination and oversight. The anonymous source tells Politico that we’ve already “vetted these guys.” We have? The story offers no evidence to back this assertion up. Did they vet these guys like they did our Taliban allies? Are “we” providing the same meticulous oversight over the aid that we did over the up to $400 billion stolen from the Covid relief bill? We have no reason to take these people at their word.

An earlier Politico piece amplified accusations by Ukrainian officials who accused Spartz of being a Putin stooge and opportunist. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry claimed Spartz was “trying to earn extra political capital.” How? By challenging the dominant position of the entire D.C. establishment? Seems unlikely. An immigrant from Ukraine, Spartz has visited the country six times since Russia invaded. Her concerns don’t strike me as unreasonable. They do not strike me as pro-Russia. Yet, according to Politico, “there’s a widespread fear that her posture is damaging U.S.-Ukraine relations at the worst possible time — and that she’s being played by forces that aim to weaken the Western alliance.”

As Nate Hochman points out, the piece offers no evidence that Spartz is being played by anyone. Nor is there any proof offered by anyone that a freshman congresswoman from Indiana has the power to weaken an international alliance. Do other NATO members not allow representatives to make inquiries on foreign aid?

Politicians signing off on tens of billions in aid should be able to openly defend their choices. Now, I certainly make no claim to have special insight into the Ukrainian/Russian conflict. Though I hope Ukraine irreparably damages Putin’s regime, I’m relatively certain Ukraine can’t “win” against a nuclear power. Surviving is a victory. That doesn’t mean, however, we should feel compelled to discard all skepticism and reason at home, or end transparency and debate, when we’re talking about a dangerous, long-term foreign policy entanglement. That is not, as history has consistently shown, a good idea.

West Might Lose New Cold War With Self-Defeating Energy Policy,"Three significant events this year indicate that we are already in a new Cold War. In early February, China and Russia established an unofficial strategic alliance by announcing “a friendship of no limits” while denouncing the Western democracies. Shortly after, Russia invaded Ukraine. After some initial hesitation and delays, the United States and its Western allies worked together to impose severe economic sanctions on Russia while providing Ukraine with military and humanitarian aid.

A new iron curtain has descended from the Baltic to the South China Sea. One side is a coalition of autocracies led by China and Russia, with illiberal regimes such as Iran and North Korea playing the supporting role. The other side we call the West, led by the United States, including liberal democracies in Europe, South Korea, and Japan. Will the West win this new Cold War?

The West claimed the victory of the last Cold War against Communism not only because of the superiority of liberal democratic values but also because of the economic strengths of the free market, which had created a higher standard of living and enormous wealth. It’s self-evident that freedom and prosperity go hand in hand. In contrast to the economic success of the West were widespread poverty and hunger in Communist countries. People in these countries either fled to the West or demanded political change at home through protests. It’s fair to say that the Berlin Wall fell, and the West won the Cold War, mainly because of its economic advantages over Communist regimes.

In today’s new Cold War, however, the West is losing its economic advantage because of its self-defeating energy policies driven by a cult-like devotion to addressing “climate change.” Aiming to slow down global warming (although our planet only warmed 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century) and bring the greenhouse emissions back to the pre-industrial revolution level, liberal elites have decided to rapidly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. They refuse to admit that despite many technological advancements, renewable energy is not reliable because the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow on demand. According to Lars Schernikau, an energy economist, “practically every wind mill or solar panel requires either a backup or storage.”

The United States and Europe’s ill-advised energy policies have little effect on global warming or greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, they have made the West vulnerable in this new Cold War for three reasons.

1. The West Has Inflicted Economic Pain and Lower Standard of Living

The West’s anti-carbon energy policies resulted in energy shortages and high energy prices long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Since food security depends on energy, high energy prices led to food inflation and shortages. Higher prices of food and energy are the main drivers of rising inflation in Europe and the U.S. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated these problems and crystallized how foolish the West’s energy policies are.

For the first time in decades, people in the West must embrace economic pain and a lower standard of living that was familiar to those of us who used to live in Communist countries. Today in Germany, people face a “cost of living crisis,” with shortages of necessities such as cooking oil, flour, and toilet paper. Some local authorities have already limited hot water and traffic lights. Others warned they might have to turn off floodlights in soccer stadiums to conserve energy, something unthinkable for a soccer-crazy nation. But it’s the coming winter that may be most dreadful. If Russia cuts off the natural gas supply, pundits in Germany predict an economic recession and “major civil disorder, a winter of cold showers and extra jumpers.”

Other European nations aren’t faring any better. The continent is on the verge of an energy-driven recession. Fed up with rising fuel prices and local governments’ insistence on their unrealistic “green” policies, Dutch farmers staged protests in the Netherlands. Now similar protests led by farmers have spread to Germany, Italy, Spain, and Poland.

Americans have been enduring economic pain too. A survey shows that rising gas and food prices have forced two-thirds of Americans to cut back on restaurants, movies, and entertainment, and to drive less. More than 4 in 10 Americans spent less on groceries. Some families have resorted to switching off lights and air conditioning due to the cost of energy. The survey also shows that the majority of Americans has a pessimistic outlook of our nation’s economy, expecting a recession.

The West cannot win the new Cold War when its green policies lead to economic suffering and political instability at home.

2. The West’s Energy Policies Have Empowered and Enriched Adversaries

Europe’s dependency on Russia’s oil and natural gas has enriched Russian President Vladimir Putin. Without money earned from energy exports to build his war chest, Putin probably would have had to think twice before he invaded Ukraine. After the European Union (EU) imposed economic sanctions on Russia after the invasion, Putin showed how he could use energy to retaliate. Russia reportedly reduced the flow of natural gas through Nord Stream (offshore natural gas pipelines run under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany) to about 40 percent of its capacity in recent months. Then it shut down the pipelines for ten days in the name of annual maintenance, when Europe was in the middle of a heat wave. Putin eventually turned the pipelines back on but “warned of possible new capacity shortfalls because of Western sanctions.” French President Emmanuel Macron finally acknowledged that energy has become “a weapon of the war.”

Anticipating the coming winter heating season, the EU urged members to cut back natural gas consumption by at least 15 percent over the next eight months and start to ration energy usage, prioritizing “essential industries.” That means both businesses and homes should expect rolling blackouts, which I was used to when growing up in Communist China. The prospect of no heat in winter may force some EU nations to give up economic sanctions on Russia in exchange for energy. A divided Europe is a win for Putin. If the EU can’t maintain a united front on sanctioning Russia, Putin will win his war in Ukraine. The EU has no one else but itself to blame for this outcome because previous U.S. administrations warned about it for years. But leaders such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to listen.

While the EU’s green energy policies were enriching Putin’s Russia, in the U.S., the Democrats’ “green” energy has enriched Communist China. U.S. government subsidies for solar panels and electric vehicles have gone to China, since that country dominates the global supply chains of critical components and materials. A rich and powerful China has helped Russia mitigate the effects of Western economic sanctions by purchasing Russia’s agricultural and energy exports. Even more troublesome, China’s “clean” energy producers have been accused of causing environmental pollution and exploiting forced Uyghur laborers.

The West cannot win the new Cold War when it looks to adversaries for energy solutions.

3. The West Faces Difficulties Building a Broader Coalition

When the West led a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 35 countries abstained or voted no. In another vote to expel Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, 58 countries abstained. Some of these “abstainers” are ideologically aligned with Russia. Others refused to join the West’s condemnation due to their economic needs. Their top concerns are food and energy security, not climate change. They are unconvinced that the West’s “green” energy policies worked when they see the once affluent West is now suffering economic pain and instability. They also witnessed how countries such as Sri Lanka collapsed economically and politically after adopting the West’s green policies. Unlike foolhardy climate alarmists in the West, leaders in these countries know that they need affordable fossil fuels, food, and fertilizer exports from Russia, and economic investment from China to keep their people happy and maintain stability. Driven by these practical economic reasons, many nations chose not to take sides. Not surprisingly, the West is having difficulty building a broader and stronger coalition against Russia.

The liberals in the West need to face the reality that not only does the world primarily run on fossil fuels, but energy has also become a powerful weapon in this new Cold War. The West cannot win this new Cold War with its self-defeating anti-carbon energy policies.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/25/the-west-might-lose-the-new-cold-war-with-its-self-defeating-energy-policy/,2022-07-25
Questions Remain About Ukrainian Leadership Despite Western Favor,"The first lady of Ukraine was in Washington last week to be feted by the Biden administration, Congress, and the corporate press. Olena Zelenska, the attractive and patriotically dressed wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was given the Jackie Kennedy/Michelle Obama treatment by fashion columnists while also helping to reinforce the message that Ukraine’s effort to defend itself against Russian aggression is a battle for democracy and the survival of the West.

This is an easy story to tell to a receptive American audience. Since the war began in February, American sympathy combined with the stiffer-than-expected struggle put up by Ukrainian forces and Zelensky’s deft public relations campaign has reinforced the message that the Kyiv government is a democracy whose defense is essential to Western security.

Yet the question to be posed about this is not whether Russia and Putin are bad but whether Ukraine is the paragon of democracy Biden says it is.

Congress recently passed a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine in May with bipartisan support. Grassroots Republicans and even portions of the Democratic base have been critical of the way Ukraine’s security has come to dictate national priorities. That $40 billion is likely to be only the first installment of a steady flow of aid to pay for the $10 billion per month that the war is costing Kyiv.

That’s what made the appearance of a story about Ukraine in The New York Times this past week, which showed a different side of Zelensky’s government, so significant. The story, titled “Zelenskyy Fires Two Top Law Enforcement Officials,” buried the lead. The Times emphasized the fact that this was the first government shakeup in Kyiv since the war started as well as the fact that one of the two people fired was a boyhood friend of Zelensky. But while that is true, the substance of the story was that the sympathy and support for the Russians among a not insignificant portion of the Ukrainian population and members of the security services has damaged the war effort.

An earlier story in the Times discussed how paranoia about potential Russian spies had spread throughout Ukrainian society. The latest dispatch made clear just how much of an issue this had become. It’s one thing to report about 200,000 spy allegations being submitted to Ukrainian authorities every month. Zelensky’s sacking of security measures made clear how “treason” cases have become something of an obsession for the Ukrainian government.

Even more alarming is the fact that several hundred of these treason investigations involved security personnel. Many Ukrainian officials, including those who were employed by the prosecutor’s office, remained behind in Russian-occupied territory and are now working for Moscow.

Still, that partly explains the large number of Ukrainian personnel helping the Russians. But the way this vast security state has been empowered by the war to turn its malevolent gaze on Ukrainian citizens — whether guilty of sympathy for Moscow or not — is chilling.

Previously, Ukraine was widely acknowledged to be as corrupt as the rest of the former Soviet Union, with a fledgling democratic system that was far from entirely free. Even after Zelensky became president, newspapers that were critical of his government were shut down. Since the war started, journalists have struggled to retain their ability to report freely and fairly.

That the majority of Ukrainians want their country to remain independent is obvious. So is their willingness to fight to prevent their nation from falling under Putin’s thumb. But the ability of the Russians to get so many Ukrainians to sympathize with or aid their assault on Ukraine illustrates that what is going on is, in part, a civil war as well as a foreign invasion.

Yet equally true is the fact that the Ukrainian state that is being defended so bravely is still deeply flawed and possessed of attributes antithetical to democracy. Though some of its problems would be present in any country at war and under direct attack, the more we learn about Ukraine, the less it resembles the Jeffersonian democracy that Biden tries to conjure up in his speeches on the subject.

While sympathy for Ukraine and hostility to Russia is understandable, these are factors that ought to be taken into consideration if the United States is to undertake the kind of financial commitment in this war that is starting to remind us of the disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Or, at least, it should if Americans are to be permitted to have a debate about making such a dubious commitment.

"DOJ May Have Impeded Biden Probes Out Of Pittsburgh, Delaware","The recent charge leveled by multiple whistleblowers that FBI headquarters falsely labeled verifiable evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden “disinformation” raises the specter that agents also impeded the separate investigations run by the Pittsburgh and Delaware U.S. attorneys’ offices.

On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions” had accused Washington Field Office assistant special agent in charge Timothy Thibault and other FBI officials of “falsely portray[ing] as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.”

The whistleblowers, Grassley explained, had further claimed that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.” “The FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny,” according to Grassley.

Conflicting Stories

This explosive revelation conflicts with the storyline leaked by law enforcement officials to the New York Times shortly after Joe Biden’s election — just as news of the investigation into the financial dealings of his son reached a fever pitch.

Soon after Hunter Biden disclosed that the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office was investigating him and had served multiple subpoenas on him and his business associates, the Times published a story discussing the separate investigation run out of the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s office.

“As federal investigators in Delaware were examining the finances of Hunter Biden during his father’s campaign for president, a similar inquiry ramped up this year in Pittsburgh, fueled by materials delivered by President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani,” the Times article opened. “Attorney General William P. Barr had asked the top federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh, Scott W. Brady, to accept and vet any information that Mr. Giuliani had on the Biden family, including Hunter Biden,” the December 14, 2020, article continued, claiming that “Brady hosted Mr. Giuliani for a nearly four-hour meeting in late January to discuss his materials.”

The Times article then proceeded to paint the then-Pittsburgh U.S. attorney as a partisan hack and, relying on unnamed sources, claimed that Barr’s decision to direct Brady to oversee an “intake process for information about Ukraine to ‘assess its provenance and its credibility,’” was “highly unusual because prosecutors in Delaware had already been scrutinizing Hunter Biden for more than a year.”

Barr made clear at the time, however, that investigators had to be careful about any information originating from Ukraine because “there are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of crosscurrents.” “We can’t take anything we received from Ukraine at face value,” Barr stressed. And the Times — while spinning the narrative that there was something nefarious about Barr’s decision to task Brady with oversight of information provided by Giuliani, claiming “the arrangement immediately raised alarms within the F.B.I. and the Justice Department” — even acknowledged in its article that Barr “has farmed out other politically sensitive investigations to trusted U.S. attorneys outside Washington.”

Then, relying “on interviews with five current and former law enforcement officials and others with knowledge of F.B.I. interactions with the Justice Department,” the Times reported that Brady sought “to take aggressive steps,” including having the FBI interview a list of potential witnesses, which supposedly “prompted a tense confrontation with F.B.I. officials at the bureau’s headquarters in Washington.”

Significantly, the Times reported that “the F.B.I. viewed the investigative steps into Mr. Biden that Mr. Brady sought as unwarranted because the Delaware inquiry involving money laundering had fizzled out and because they were skeptical of Mr. Giuliani’s material. For example, they had already examined a laptop owned by Mr. Biden and an external hard drive that had been abandoned at a computer store in Wilmington and found nothing to advance the inquiry.”

The Times had previously reported that “as part of the F.B.I.’s closely held money-laundering investigation into [Hunter] Biden, agents working with federal prosecutors in Delaware authorized a federal grand jury subpoena and obtained the laptop and an external hard drive.” In seizing the laptop and external hard drive from the Delaware repair store, the FBI’s receipt confirming the seizure “included an F.B.I. code, 272D, the bureau’s internal classification for money laundering investigations, and ‘BA’ for its Baltimore field office.” (The FBI’s Baltimore field office supports the Delaware’s U.S. Attorney’s office.) But, according to the Times’ sources, “the F.B.I. examined the laptop but that its contents did not advance the money-laundering investigation.”

An FBI Leak

But now, some two years later, we know that the Times reporting is factually incorrect, which even the New York legacy outlet’s coverage earlier this year confirms, in two respects. First, the “money laundering” aspect of the Delaware inquiry into Hunter Biden had not “fizzled out,” but according to their sources remains a part of the Delaware U.S. attorney’s grand jury investigation. And second, the laptop contained evidence supportive of the money-laundering probe and potentially other crimes.

Yet in 2020, five officials told the Times a different story, and some further claimed that in response to the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s investigation, FBI agents “found ways to ostensibly satisfy Mr. Brady,” raising questions of how precisely they thwarted his investigation.

When coupled with what the multiple whistleblowers, including some in senior positions, told Grassley, it appears the FBI headquarters either improperly withheld information or presented inaccurate information to the U.S. attorney’s office in Pittsburgh and possibly also Delaware.

And what better way to hide that fact than for FBI headquarters to leak to the New York Times that the laptop held nothing nefarious and to portray any investigative findings coming from the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s office as politically suspect? With that narrative in place, other FBI agents, including those supporting the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office investigation, would have no reason to question FBI headquarters’ claims that evidence was “disinformation.”

What other purpose would the leaks to the Times serve? With a Biden election, a new slate of U.S. attorneys would soon be on the job, so the political hit on Brady made no sense at that late date. Similarly, many of the complaints aired in the December 2020 piece by the Times’ sources concerned fears that Brady or his team would influence the November 2020 election by leaking details of the investigation, but with the election over and without any leaks, that criticism rang hollow.

But if the five unnamed officials knew they had withheld information from the Pittsburgh and Delaware U.S. attorney’s offices related to the investigation into the Biden family and/or had improperly closed down sources and evidentiary trails as alleged by the whistleblowers, then creating the public perception that there is “no there, there” would help hide this reality.

So as Grassley proceeds with his investigation into the whistleblowers’ allegations, he should also assess whether FBI headquarters withheld or provided inaccurate information to the two U.S. attorney’s offices that had been charged with investigating Hunter Biden and his family business dealings. More significantly, with the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office still investigating Biden, it is imperative that prosecutors there — or better yet, a special counsel — review all evidence gathered by the Pittsburgh office and any files touched by FBI headquarters to ensure the integrity of the investigation.

Former U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and Delaware U.S. Attorney David C. Weiss both declined to comment in response to inquiries by The Federalist. Grassley’s office, however, confirmed to The Federalist that the senator has not spoken with either the Pittsburgh or the Delaware U.S. attorney’s offices about the whistleblowers’ allegations.

Vogue Is Here To Tell You How Serious Volodymyr Zelensky Is,"In case you weren’t won over to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s personal fan club by his demands for $7 billion per month from the West (read: U.S. taxpayers), maybe this will convince you: a cover story in Vogue!

While war ravages his country — a war which Zelensky insists the West enter — the president and his wife are enjoying their newfound spotlight, posing for a gushing Vogue puff piece with the glossy, dramatic photos to match.

“We have no doubt we will prevail.” As the war in Ukraine enters a critical new phase, the country’s First Lady, Olena Zelenska, has become a key player—a frontline diplomat and the face of her nation’s emotional toll. https://t.co/DCXWYnzAsK pic.twitter.com/wcaY5IFGHf — Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) July 26, 2022

You can both agree the deaths of innocents in Ukraine are tragic and be unsettled by the Zelenskys’ use of that tragedy to bask in the fawning adoration of global outlets. In fact, those two beliefs aren’t contradictory but complementary.

Instead of negotiating a settlement that could likely help cease the death and despair that his citizens are enduring, Zelensky is trying to escalate the Russia-Ukraine war by dragging the West into direct conflict with Russia, a nuclear power. He is milking the world’s sympathy for photoshoots in Vogue while his people suffer. While no one contests that Russian President Vladimir Putin bears full responsibility for the reprehensible war, Zelensky has shown little interest in negotiations that could potentially avoid the long, brutal slog he wants Western dollars to prolong.

I don’t blame the Zelenskys for wanting to draw attention to their struggle. I do blame them for trying to guilt the West into escalating it. And after seeing the Vogue cover story, I blame them for thinking their veneration in the minds of Americans is so sacrosanct that sitting under hair and makeup artists for an almost comically dramatic photoshoot would not make anyone question their sincerity.

“On one day she [Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady] wore an ecru silk blouse with a black velvet bow tied around the neck and a black mid-calf skirt, her ash-blond hair swept up in a loose bun,” Vogue writer Rachel Donadio gushes. “The next day, it was wide-leg jeans, chunky white sneakers with yellow and blue detailing, a nod to the Ukrainian flag and a fundraising project by the brand The Coat, her hair loose on her shoulders, and a rust-colored button-down shirt.”

“I couldn’t help but think the shirt had the same rusty hue as the burned-out Russian tanks that I saw lining roads in Irpin and Bucha,” Donadio continues in a line that miraculously made it past an editor. How can we make people take the war more seriously? I know, talk about tanks but make it fashion!

In case describing what she’s wearing wasn’t enough, Vogue tells us whom Mrs. Zelenska is wearing. “In this story the first lady wears Ukrainian designers such as Bettter, Six, Hvoya, The Coat, Kachorovska, and Poustovit,” states the caption on a photo of the president and his wife embracing at a table while staring wistfully into the camera. It’s also noted who served the Zelenskys as stylist, style assistants, makeup artist, hair stylist, and producers.

The article talks about how Zelenska listened to Aerosmith and The Beatles as a teenager and about her favorite movies. One photo shows the Zelenskys holding hands at an ornate, inlaid-wood table, with self-portraits of themselves sitting on the furniture in the background.

In another photo, Zelenska poses with her hand in a fist over her heart, every hair perfectly in place as she appears to walk through a war-torn scene, past a bullet-riddled plane painted with the colors of the Ukrainian flag and surrounded by “a group of female Ukrainian soldiers.” That girl-power message is made explicit earlier in the piece, when Donadio quotes a former Vogue editor to say, “The female voices in this war need to be heard, need to be represented.” Because nothing says “taking war seriously” like criticizing war for not involving enough women.

The Vogue shoot comes on the heels of Zelenska’s visit to Washington, D.C. “Whether Zelenska’s visit to Washington yields real results, it was a reminder of the power of image-making. And images matter,” the puff piece said of her charm offensive. The glossy Vogue images do indeed matter to Americans battling inflation and wondering whether billions of their tax dollars helped fund the photoshoot — but perhaps not in the way Vogue intended.

US Taxpayers Are Funding Ukraine's Blacklisting Of Americans For Wrongthink,"On July 14, the Ukrainian government published a bizarre list of academics, politicians, policymakers, and contrarian journalists, who are allegedly propagandists for Russia. The list includes sitting U.S. senators such as Rand Paul, R-Ky., former politicians such as Tulsi Gabbard, and military theorists such as Martin van Creveld and Edward Luttwak, as well as perhaps the foremost living international relations theorist of our times, John Mearsheimer.

A report in Unherd cites a report from the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation explaining that “the exact criteria for inclusion are also unclear, although next to each name the report lists the ‘pro-Russian’ opinions the individual promotes. For example, Edward Luttwak’s breach was to suggest that ‘referendums should be held in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions;’ Mearsheimer’s breach is recorded as him saying that ‘NATO has been in Ukraine since 2014’ and that ‘NATO provoked Putin.’”

If that sounds familiar, one might wish to recall documents unearthed by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., about similarly oriented programs planned by the Biden administration. They sound extremely similar. As the Unherd story adds, “The ‘Center for Countering Disinformation,’ established in 2021 under Volodymyr Zelenskyy and headed by former lawyer Polina Lysenko, sits within the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine. Its stated aim is to detect and counter ‘propaganda’ and ‘destructive disinformation’ and to prevent the ‘manipulation of public opinion.’”

Given that the Ukrainian government is being subsidized with billions of American dollars, this censorship amounts to American taxpayers paying the Ukrainian government billions of dollars to blacklist American citizens for thought crimes.

John Mearsheimer is one of the kindest mentors young scholars might ever have. Not to mention, he is a towering intellect and a pioneer of the school of international relations theory, known as Offensive Realism. Simply put, this theory argues that the world order is anarchic with no global policeman and that states should be nationalist and take care of their own, instead of pursuing utopian financial and military adventures abroad.

Mearsheimer also understood, before everyone else, why the rise of China is the greatest hegemonic threat that the U.S. faces in history, long before the concept of the Thucydides Trap was coined, and long before the economic coercions, unprecedented naval build-up, intellectual property thefts, and espionage attempts started. He also understood before all contemporary intellectuals, why wasting blood and treasure in the Middle East will dissuade the U.S. from balancing China.

But notably, what likely landed Mearsheimer on Ukraine’s blacklist, was how he understood why pushing NATO expansion would lead to war, why there would be no NATO cavalry to save Ukraine as nuclear deterrence works both ways, what structural forces led to American foreign policy turning increasingly crusading in the last couple of decades, and why America is prone to be influenced by foreign lobbying.

If not anything else, purely from a sense of propriety or respect for academic eminence, the attempted thought policing by Ukrainian officials should be considered internal interference and should infuriate any decent man.

As Dan Caldwell, the VP of Stand Together, tweeted, “Let’s be clear: this is an attempt by an increasingly illiberal Ukrainian government to silence, intimidate, and smear several prominent American foreign policy scholars whose views are increasingly shared by the American people and policymakers. @StateDept should condemn.”

Caldwell added, “Yes there are some goofballs on this list. But that is the point. The Ukrainian government wanted to lump Mearsheimer, Bandow, Luttawak et al in with the loony toons to make it harder to defend the ones who are actually well-respected and credentialed.”

Caldwell is, of course, succinct and correct, except the Ukrainian government, the country’s assorted lobbying network, and the relentless war propaganda blinded us to the fact that, culturally and tactically, there is no difference between the two warring sides.

Ukraine is rife with true-blue fascists who were all called fascists by the same people who now bizarrely write different history: that high-profile supporters of Ukraine repeatedly sought collective punishment on Russians, and that Ukraine repeatedly interfered in previous U.S. elections; that Ukraine cannot survive without American money and that nothing is worse than the toxic combination of victimhood, chain-ganging, and sanctimony; and that the current Ukraine government, despite the relentless one-sided propaganda and despite individual heroism of average Ukrainians, is a perfect mix of it.

Ultimately how Ukraine deals with dissenters within Ukraine at a time of war is no one else’s business. States turn illiberal during war; it is an iron law of history. What matters, however, is this global state-sponsored crusade on “disinformation,” that seeks to delegitimize any alternative viewpoint using any smear necessary.

The same people who are the most vocal about the threat to democracy are the same ones currently arguing that “systemic racism” is a major threat to U.S. national security. And these are the very same forces that argue that anyone who wants to remain neutral in a war on the furthest periphery is a “Putinist.” It is past time to see the connection between these worldviews and perceive the totalitarian threat emerging from this new ideological edifice.

What The Ukraine War Reveals About Fragile Food Supply Chains,"Since 2019, there have been three black swan events of historical significance in the global agricultural commodity market: African Swine Fever in China, Covid-19, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Each has altered market dynamics, trade flows, and food production in unprecedented ways. Some economists suggest that this tumult could lead to a pullback in globalization. We anticipate a globalization reset instead, where friends and allies work more closely together to ensure a stable food supply. Let’s look at a few data points to see why.

At the top of this list is China’s ongoing recovery from African Swine Fever, which initially led to the country losing nearly 7 percent of its hog population and resulted in China quickly becoming the largest corn importing nation on Earth. This happened when they chose to start feeding pigs corn instead of “swill” or food scraps to reduce disease. China’s sudden and completely unprecedented demand for more than 25 million metric tons of corn from the world market was the initial force that altered global supply and demand fundamentals.

China was hamstrung by a limited global corn supply with options to buy from Ukraine, Brazil, and the United States. Brazil wasn’t tenable because of China’s already large dependence on their soybeans, and the United States looked even worse because of the ongoing trade war between the two countries. So China diversified but ended up buying lots of corn from Ukraine, which was successful until Vladimir Putin waged war on the Ukrainians in February of 2022.

Many people assume Russia’s war on Ukraine was the beginning of the food shortfalls. That assumption is incorrect. The war intensified and exacerbated several problems that existed before the invasion began.

For example, fertilizer prices skyrocketed this year, mainly because Russia and Ukraine export 28 percent of the nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium fertilizer used globally. However, it was China that made the first decision to stop exporting phosphate fertilizers last summer as they recovered from Covid-19. China accounts for 27 percent of the world’s production of nitrogen, 39 percent of phosphorus, and 13 percent of potash. So, the war compounded the effects that Covid-19 had already set into motion.

The same can be said of our original storyline. Shortfalls in corn production are compounded by the removal of Ukraine’s production, but they started when China’s demand spiked in 2019.

Wheat shortfalls have been a particular focus since the war began, and rightfully so. However, the absence of Russian and Ukrainian wheat is not the only choke point. China’s minister of agriculture and rural affairs said that their wheat production could be down by as much as a third this year due mainly to environmental factors that further compound the global problem.

These three events demonstrate the significant volatility and interdependence of today’s commodity markets both before and even more so since Putin attacked Ukraine. What does this all mean, and how are countries likely to respond to these three black swan events?

First, we believe there is little evidence that a “self-sufficiency” model will work to secure supply for any single country. Israel, as an example, has been pursuing this strategy with limited success. Most countries do not have the available, high-quality soil needed to become self-sufficient, nor do they have the know-how and capital needed to build such a program. Thus, most of the world’s countries will continue to look to international markets to feed their people.

Secondly, higher-income countries will start to consider food security as national security, leading them to make wiser procurement choices. We anticipate some “decoupling” of economies as politicians look to source crops and proteins closer to home and more frequently with allies than adversaries. As an example of this, instead of China living up to its commitments in Phase I of the trade deal, they have chosen to purchase more corn from Brazil instead of the U.S. as they seek to fill the missing supply from Ukraine.

Finally, there will be increased scrutiny on foreign investment in domestic agriculture. This tide is coming and will be particularly acute in the U.S., where foreign entities own everything from our largest pork processing company to vast swaths of agricultural land, our fourth largest meat packer, and one of the largest seed and chemical companies.

The Committee on the Foreign Investment in the U.S. should, and likely will, ramp up scrutiny on these investments going forward. The United States should also take this opportunity to invest in domestic chemical and fertilizer production to eliminate our dependence on Russia, China, and Belarus.

As higher-income countries seek to secure their food supplies and lower-income countries become more dependent on food aid programs, these changing dynamics will reduce globalization as we know it.

It’s Time For America Firsters To Push For Getting Out Of Europe,"European statecraft toward the United States is predicated on a toxic mix of sanctimony and free-riding. This is continuing to push the U.S. foreign policy establishment into doubling down on a failed grand strategy that is leading to insolvency.

“To the continent’s eternal shame, as one senior British official told me, the apparently divided, dysfunctional, and declining power of the U.S. has still managed to send drastically more lethal aid to save European democracy than any other NATO power,” wrote Tom McTague in his recent piece for The Atlantic. “The depth of America’s military-industrial complex and the scale of its imperial bureaucracy mean that they are simply too heavy for a single president or Congress to remove in one go.”

He adds:

Many Europeans have long considered American decline an inevitability and have looked to prepare themselves for such an eventuality. … But then Russia invaded Ukraine, and everything changed. Suddenly, Europe’s grand strategy was in tatters, and American strength seemed to reassert itself. Europe discovered it had not become more independent from the U.S. but more dependent on it.

This is a comforting fantasy, but it overlooks another, much simpler hypothesis with a lot more explanatory power. It’s that European free-riding is continuing, boosted by flattery.

The nationalist ascendency that elevated Donald Trump once again risks being co-opted by the establishment edifice, couched in the language of nationalism and foreign policy realism, while advocating for boilerplate globalist policies. Volodymyr Zelensky T-shirts are being sold bearing the phrase, “America First.”

Unlimited foreign aid continues, with America functionally running the government of Ukraine and its tax dollars filling the coffers of Ukrainian lobby groups to spend on Vogue photoshoots. Inflation runs high, as U.S. spending on low-energy policies and foreign aid increases. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization just added two more rich countries, with American troop presence increasing in Europe, at a time Russia is incapable of conquering one-third of the most corrupt country in the region.

European condescension exemplifies why the time is now for the nationalist right to argue for a detached foreign policy in Europe, in order to focus more on America’s borders and the rise of China. In a few months, the United States has racked up a bill in the billions engaging in a proxy war with no end in sight. U.S. weaponry is unaccounted for, and troop presence in the European theater increased significantly.

No one in the U.S. Department of Defense, White House, or Congress seems to know how or when the conflict ends, in what sounds eerily similar to previous American engagements in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. There too, tax dollars were funneled to a class of bureaucrats, NGOs, and lobby groups in the name of “safeguarding” the liberal world order. Of all the internal foreign policy debates on the right, the question of Europe is the most prominent and perhaps the easiest to address.

Those who are arguably most worried about America’s decline in Europe are the same people who would like the United States to overstretch to the point of insolvency and collapse. It is an old European tendency that American conservatives of an older pre-World War generation instinctively understood.

It seems counterintuitive at first but makes perfect sense if you’re a realist. Europe is a rich continent that is perfectly capable of solving its own problems: financially and militarily supporting its continental frontiers, and balancing against a decrepit Russia incapable of conquest. European faux concern about American decline alongside European inaction, and Europe’s coaxing and flattering America into further overstretching, all while Europe lectures sanctimoniously about American dysfunction and democratic decline, are not separate issues. They are interrelated and evident to any rational observer.

There are a few notable outliers. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was the only senator to oppose the mindless NATO expansion. That earned him the mantle of the only true-blue America First senator. Eighteen Republican members of Congress also opposed it, and not a single Democrat.

Yet 11 Republican senators and 57 Republican members of Congress opposed the $40 billion emergency aid package to Ukraine, a rare public refusal to rubberstamp reckless beltway foreign policy dogma at a time of crippling inflation and relentless southern border breaches. The opposition to continuous aid to Ukraine was only among Republicans. This all confirms once more that true nationalist conservatism, as well as a minimal foreign policy realism, is only to be found on the right.

The success of the nationalist right is dependent not just on numbers and answers, but on policies and debates. At a time everyone claims the mantle of America First, the question of Europe helps us understand who truly is a nationalist and a realist.

The latest primary results for House and Senate seats put some foreign policy realist candidates on the ballot going into the midterms, an encouraging indicator of the growing coalition. But size only matters insofar as policy exists to support it.

The main task in front of the nationalist right isn’t just to win internal debates, or even primaries, but to put their positions boldly in front of the American people. A renewed debate about further commitment and burden in the European theater is the easiest place to start.

Not Just Afghanistan: Incompetence Is All Over Biden Presidency,"Monday marked the one-year anniversary of the fall of Kabul, and even the media machine can’t deny that the Biden administration’s execution of the necessary U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was disastrous. What they fail to acknowledge, though, is that the rank incompetence that plagued that withdrawal has shown up in practically every hire, decision, and policy position in the Biden administration.

Covid Tyranny

Biden slammed his predecessor for his inability to stop an endemic airborne virus and promised to “get [Covid] under control” and “beat this virus.” Of course, even for a capable administration, that was an impossible task — and under Biden, the Covid toll only grew while freedoms shrunk. Even though the Biden administration oversaw more people receiving (or being forced to receive) shots that had been manufactured under the Trump administration, Biden still presided over more Covid deaths in his first year in office than Trump did in 2020. And as my colleague Eddie Scarry noted, by last September, a majority of U.S. adults reported “little to no trust in Biden to relay accurate information related to COVID-19.”

Covid hysteria has died down as Americans have grown tired of politicians’ lockdowns and media fearmongering — and as the media have found other crises to fan. But it hasn’t been a result of any competent effort by the Biden administration, which spent more than a year getting people fired with heavy-handed mandates and nuking dissent from cyberspace.

Deadly Border Crisis

After the Biden administration signaled a change from the Trump administration’s hardline stance on border security, the human trafficking industry run by cartels at the U.S.-Mexico border has surged. We’ve seen record after record number of illegal immigrants apprehended at the border — a metric that doesn’t even account for those who get through undetected. Horrific footage in September 2021 showing roughly 12,000 migrants in a crowded encampment under the international bridge in Del Rio, Texas, reflected how out-of-control the continuing crisis at the border is. As my colleague Jordan Boyd reported in April, “In 2021, at least 650 migrants died during their attempts to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border,” many due to drowning, heat, or cartel violence.

A pastor who runs shelters in Matamoros, Mexico, told The Federalist’s John Daniel Davidson and Emily Jashinsky that the cartel “controls everything here now.” The Biden administration has continually shown itself either unwilling, unable, or both, to put an end to the lawless smuggling and the deaths and violence it causes.

Painful Gas Prices

The average gas price in the U.S. hit a new record, north of $5.00 per gallon, in June under Biden’s watch. While the unpopular administration has managed to inch that price down artificially by depleting our strategic oil reserve to dangerously low levels — an “accomplishment” they’re all too willing to brag about — gas prices remain close to $4.00 per gallon, far higher than the roughly $2.39 voters were paying on the day Biden took office. The administration tried its best to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the spike in fuel costs, but even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a gallon of gas cost more than $3.50 on average around the country.

It’s an intentional repercussion of the Biden administration’s well-known plan to drive the U.S. off of gas and oil and replace those industries with “green” options. Both Biden’s promises and actions have confirmed as much, and Congress’s bizarrely-named “Inflation Reduction Act” will only make things worse.

Spiking Inflation

Speaking of inflation, the Biden administration has overseen inflation breaking 40-year records nearly every month. Year-over-year inflation rates have hovered around 8 and 9 percent, while certain grocery staples have jumped almost 25 percent. And now that the country is barrelling into a recession with two consecutive quarters of downturn in economic activity, the Biden administration’s incompetent response is to redefine a “recession” and insist that inflation is “zero.”

Disaster in Ukraine

The Biden administration hasn’t fixed its post-Afghanistan reputation for foreign policy disaster by its response to the Russia-Ukraine war. In a bumbling jumble of remarks in January, Biden appeared to green-light a “minor incursion” of Russia into Ukraine, before adding, “My guess is [Putin] will move in. He has to do something.” And when a reporter sought clarification and asked, “Are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?” Biden replied, “That’s how it did sound like, didn’t it?”

Since Putin invaded Ukraine a month later, the Biden administration and Congress have done nothing but throw money at the problem and stage dramatic photo-ops, spending $54 billion of taxpayers’ earnings with no assurance that money and weapons will even make it into the right hands.

A Roster of Incompetent Hires

At the top of all these fiascos is a dementia patient who can hardly get through a teleprompter speech without a gaffe, such as reading “repeat the line” out loud or forgetting what year it is. And the incompetence doesn’t improve down the chain of command, among officials who seem to have been picked more for checking identity politics boxes than for their qualifications. Vice President Kamala Harris has failed at every policy area she’s been appointed over, and is infamous for thoughtful commentary like, “It is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day.”

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose qualifications included enjoying the board game “Ticket to Ride,” took two months off for paternity leave while the nation endured a supply-chain crisis. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wouldn’t even admit whether the president knew what was going on during the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, and posed in front of an upside-down Mexican flag in February 2021 when bragging about America’s relationship with Mexico.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm couldn’t tell reporters “how many barrels of oil the U.S. consumes on a daily basis,” and called a question about increasing U.S. oil production to bring down gas prices “hilarious.” And Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has responded to a largely softball press corps by talking about the “Department of DOJ” and looking at her briefing book for more than 20 seconds only to admit “I don’t have anything new” when asked about the baby formula shortage in June.

From intentional “failure” (like driving gas prices up in an attempt to force Americans to follow Democrats’ green pipe dreams) to arrogance (such as thinking Americans either won’t care or won’t be able to do anything about it), even the Biden administration’s intentional decisions are executed with incompetence. Unfortunately, the botched Afghanistan withdrawal one year ago was neither the only nor the last sign of it.

The Biden Agenda: America First (To Be Screwed),"Has anyone else noticed that every major measure taken by the Biden administration seems all but designed to either screw Americans, or at a minimum, work to the advantage of everyone but Americans?

Good, so it’s not just me, then.

Let’s look at just a few of them.

The raid of the private residence of a former president (and front runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination). This one is very obviously intended to screw Americans, namely Donald Trump but by extension, his millions of supporters being told to watch their champion harassed and humiliated, not just by his political opposition, but by the nation’s top law enforcement agency.

The ongoing persecution of hundreds of people affiliated with the Jan. 6 riot, the vast majority of whom are ridiculously charged with the crime of being in the Capitol building and aimlessly walking around. Lest there be any doubt that this preoccupation is explicitly designed to screw with Americans, Biden’s Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland are constantly reminding everyone about it with public statements and press releases: “Six Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol”; “Ten Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol”; “One Year Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol”; “19 Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol.” They’re like a more annoying version of the girls from high school who would mark down the number of days they had a new boyfriend. “It’s our three-week anniversary!” “It’s our one-month!” “Six weeks, aww!”

The billions of dollars in “aid” to Ukraine. Not only are Americans suffering from soaring prices of basic groceries and living expenses thanks to all the welfare Biden and Democrats in Congress needlessly and recklessly doled out in 2021, but we’re also being told it’s our “patriotic duty” to watch as yet billions more are sent to Ukraine to fight a war that Biden helped provoke. Enjoy your $5 box of cereal and don’t you dare ask questions about our mission in Ukraine. Americans get screwed. Ukrainians get rich (and photo spreads in glossy magazines).

The border. Biden invited all of Latin America’s destitute to live right alongside you and your family. Have a heart and screw you!

Energy production. I know it’s supposed to be a big win for Biden that the national gas price average has fallen from the more than $5 per gallon it was two months ago, but recall that it was almost $1 cheaper than this last year. And this was only after Biden began draining our strategic reserves, which are intended for catastrophic crises, like warfare, not for political relief because a president had stupidly decided to shut down oil production in the name of environmentalism. Oh, and then he sent some of our reserves to China. Get screwed, America!

Next question: Does anyone else feel like this is all happening on purpose?

Okay, good, so it’s not just me, then.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/17/the-biden-agenda-america-first-to-be-screwed/,2022-08-17
It’s Time To Treat Social Media As A Public Health Emergency,"The following is a rush transcript of my recent interview with Tristan Harris, co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology and co-host of the “Your Undivided Attention” podcast. Tristan, a former design ethicist at Google whom you may remember from Netflix’s “The Social Dilemma,” joined Federalist Radio Hour on Thursday to discuss the urgent threats posed by social media.

We discussed everything from TikTok and national security to the metaverse to the psychology of social networks and their incentive structures. Our personal, professional, and political lives are now largely filtered through these poisonous platforms, the largest of which is owned by a company that operates out of a hostile foreign country.

We are in the midst of a tech crisis and a public health emergency. Tristan’s insights make that abundantly clear. It’s time for consumers, lawmakers, media, and business leaders to start recognizing that.

You can read the rush transcript and listen to the full episode below.

Tristan Harris Explains Why The Tech Crisis Is Much Worse Than We Realizehttps://t.co/ihuMSRgMYs — The Federalist (@FDRLST) August 18, 2022

Emily Jashinsky: We’re back with another edition of The Federalist Radio Hour. I’m Emily Jashinsky, culture editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at the Federalist dot com, follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I’m joined by Tristan Harris. He’s the co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology, which is catalyzing a comprehensive shift toward humane technology that operates for the common good.

He’s also the co-host of Your Undivided Attention, which consistently ranks among the top ten technology podcasts on Apple Podcasts and explores how social media’s race for attention is destabilizing society and the vital insights we need to envision solutions. Tristan, you probably remember from “The Social Dilemma”, which we talked about here, and we talk about the Center for Humane Tech, I cite it all the time here. So our listeners are certainly familiar with that. Formerly a design ethicist at Google. Tristan, thank you so much for joining Federalist Radio Hour.

Tristan Harris: My pleasure to be here, Emily.

EJ: So many, many, many people have seen The Social Dilemma. Just incredibly successful documentary that aired on Netflix and it covers your background pretty extensively. But for anybody who may have missed that, could you just brief us on your career and how you ended up at the Center for Humane Technology?

TH: Yeah, so I let’s see, I grew up in the Bay Area of California, and for the beginning of my life and career, I used to be very optimistic on technology. I actually thought I wanted to work at Apple and be part of the next Macintosh team. And actually since I was about 11 years old, I thought I wanted to do that.

So I was really early on what the positive and optimistic and inspiring cases that technology can really, you know, be in our lives. And I was really affected by, I think, the people and the culture that built the Macintosh. And so I knew I wanted to go into technology early on. I went to Stanford, got a degree in computer science and psychology not a degree in psychology, but kind of studied at the intersection of psychology, persuasion, sociology.

What influences human beings outside their awareness? I was a magician as a kid, and I took a class that was connected to this lab at Stanford called the Persuasive Technology Lab with Professor B.J. Fogg. And it was really the combination with the background with magic that I got interested in, how is technology restructuring our attention, our feelings, our thoughts, the choices that we make?

And that might sound like a conspiracy theory to many people, hopefully less so now, now that The Social Dilemma has kind of come out on Netflix and made that clear. But that was really where my attention went is how is technology shaping society, not just shaping in like a minor way, like rearranging on a restaurant menu, which item comes first which might affect your choices by like 2% or 5%, but really reshaping the entire basis of how 3 billion people make sense of the world. You know, so anyway, we can get into all that. But that’s kind of a bit of my background. And today we have let’s see, I could quickly summarize it to the best of my bio that might be relevant for folks.

I was a tech entrepreneur. I started a small company called Aperture. It was acquired by Google. I landed at Google and then became concerned about the issues of the attention economy in this race for attention and how I thought that was going to create perverse side effects starting in early on in 2012, 2013. And so I then became a design ethicist at Google studying how do you ethically be in the position of responsibility for 2 billion people’s attention starting with things like Gmail and notifications and then also going all the way up to structuring the competition of different social media platforms for our attention which would then lead to news and sense making in the way that newsfeeds rank things. So all of that then led us, led me to leave Google because I was not able to get anything done there and started this organization nonprofit called the Center for Human Technology, which is how we actuate the change in the world that we’re trying to see.

EJ: Google is such a good example because if I’m remembering correctly, in The Social Dilemma, you talk about Gmail, and Gmail is not Facebook, it’s not Twitter. It’s not Instagram or TikTok. It’s not something people often think about in terms of this context of the attention economy. It’s, you know, just the sort of blunt device that just delivers your mail in the same way that the USPS does.

But when you’re acting as a design ethicist at Google and you’re looking at Gmail, you’re basically trying to capture as much of any human being’s attention as you possibly can. Can you explain a little bit about the work of a design ethicist? And another question I have is how common those positions are in Silicon Valley, how they’ve changed or shifted or proliferated even over the last decade?

TH: Yeah, my other position name was head of the Ministry of Truth. No, I’m kidding. It’s funny actually watching that conversation go that direction, actually, because people think, OK, you know, Google is making there’s— this person called Tristan who’s thinking about the ethics of design choices, and they’re deciding what I’m going to get and what I’m going to see.

And that’s kind of alarming to people like who are they to choose how my life is structured or designed. But as you said, with Gmail, it’s more subtle, right? Because you think, Gmail, you think it looks like a neutral platform like I only get an email if someone sent me an email. But if you think about it, I mean, what drove me interested in into Gmail first?

I was addicted to email. I don’t know. Many of us, some people laughed at that in the film, actually. But, you know, you refresh your email, like 4 seconds later,I might pull to refresh again. I think it’s really important for listeners, just think about that. There’s a million behaviors we do on our smartphone every day that make no rational sense.

You’ll refresh to see how many likes you got or what new email you got, like a slot machine and then you do something else for about 30 seconds and you go right back to refreshing again. And notice that makes no rational sense. And I watch myself doing this, and I knew from the Persuasive Technology Class at Stanford in which we read a book called Don’t Shoot the Dog about clicker training for dogs, and also the way that Las Vegas slot machines work and I just noticed that this was what was going on for me, and I knew exactly how this worked.

I literally read the books on it. I studied with the people who built it, and I was addicted to my email. Now, an example like you’re saying, OK, so how does Gmail actually make design choices that affect what we see? Well, I’ll give you a real example. It was 20, I think it was 2013, And I was with the handful of people designing Gmail, which has a billion users at the time, and new cafe. I would go into anywhere around the world, have the laptops open, had Gmail open, right. Like it was where people live, not just an app to use. It’s a digital habitat. People do their work there and they leave it open all day.

And so, for example, if when a new email comes in, in your browser tab, it adds the parentheses, you know, the number goes four, five, six, ten, right? That’s attracting your attention. So whatever else you were doing, suddenly a design choice about should we update the title in the tab that says the number of unread emails that’s going to draw people’s attention there.

So even that which seems this like, well, that’s just a rational thing to do. Of course, I’m going to let the user know how many messages they have, but just that tiny design choice is causing people to switch tabs and basically not get anything done all day because they’re constantly distracted by checking the latest email. A concrete example of how Gmail at the time at the mobile app was trying to get more aggressive in this arms race for attention was they were competing with the regular email app on everyone’s phone and they needed to get you to switch from the regular email app into their custom Gmail app.

And so they, and I was in a meeting and an engineer said to me, like, Why don’t we make it buzz your phone every time you get an email because then you’ll never miss. We’ll turn email into text messaging basically. And that’s how we’ll outcompete the regular mail app. And you know, it seems like such an innocuous decision.

But there I was in that moment, he said that in my mind, visualized like these puppet strings going out into the sky, into the cloud and coming down and interrupting a billion dinner table conversations, you know, couples who are out on a date and, you know, or with, you know, with their families or something. And then their phone buzzes and it makes their attention just like 15% less.

They’re less available, less present for their family members. And so in a subtle way, even something as tiny as that would affect and restructure kind of these these billions of moments. But then, of course, that was way before we got to social media driving polarization, making us, you know, breaking down a shared reality, making democracies you know, dysfunctional.

We can get into more of that later, but I think that’s helpful context for your listeners.

EJ: Well, and it does highlight the irreconcilable, what feels like an irreconcilable tension between profit and consumer demand in that, you know, if you’re conditioning consumers to demand something very particular, you get into cigarette territory, you get into the territory of, you know, if you’re taking away or you’re eroding people’s free will intentionally, you want you’re profiting off of the question of ethics is is huge.

And, you know, this is something you think about all the time, obviously. But how does that is it possible to to reconcile that like is it possible to ethically design a cigarette? Is it possible? Great question. You know, or, you know, you can shift it. You say is it possible to ethically design Doritos? Well, probably. But, you know, it’s different degrees in different scales.

And we’ve seen Apple, for instance, you know, they tell you how much time you spent on your phone every week and TikTok, that’s a whole other can of worms, allows users now to track their time. Like we have seen some efforts in this direction. They don’t seem particularly meaningful to me.

And I’m curious, they’re not how to resolve those tensions if it’s possible.

TH: I love your question of can you design an ethical cigarette or can you design an ethical Ben and Jerry’s that isn’t just diabetes in a spoon? You know, I mean, it’s and many people say, well, that’s just what people want. We’re giving people what they want. But I think and so according to the logic of what people point their attention at is what they want.

If you use that logic. So if you put your attention on something, then I’m going to give you more of the thing you’re putting your attention on. We’re not making a distinction between what we want versus what we can’t help but look at. And I think this is really important because there’s a lot of things we can’t help but look at conflict, the most extreme version of what every political tribe is doing, you know, and also things that we’re traumatized by.

Like if you are a person who, if you’re Asian-American and you have had an experience of being, I don’t know, hate or belittled in the street or something, some kind of violence or something against you, that’s like a thing that you’re traumatized by. So you’re going to really look at it when it shows up in the news feed.

And then you click on one of those examples on, say, Twitter. And then Twitter’s like, oh, I’m going to show you a million more examples like that, because that’s the thing that worked for getting your attention. Now, meanwhile, you have a bunch of other people who are not clicking on that first example, and then they’re not getting reinforced with a thousand other examples of Asian-American hate.

So when they say there’s this thing that’s happening, it’s a really big deal and everybody is like I don’t see that happening. I mean, I’m, you know, a guy living in San Francisco, white. I don’t have that background. I’m not seeing any of those examples. So they sound kind of like they’re overreaching or crazy to me if I don’t see those same examples in my newsfeed.

So but that’s true for every side. Every side has a set of things that they’re seeing, like the you know, the pro CRT people, the anti people, the pro Black Lives Matter people, the anti-Black Lives Matter people. Everyone is seeing a different reality because you click on two videos and then it gives you infinite evidence that confirms what you already feel.

And so I’m not trying to say, well, there actually is this one absolute reality. That’s true. One of the problems of the modern world is like how big a problem is I don’t know, systemic racism. I mean, where do where do we where do we see that? How could you know, my eyeballs can’t see what 3 billion people are experiencing.

So how do I size up where that problem lives? And we’re only left to media that represents that to us. And so I’m not saying what is or isn’t true. I’m just, I want to really point people’s attention at the degree to which we’re missing each other. And there’s a great group called More in Common. We did actually a podcast episode with their director, Dan Vallone, on what they call perception gaps, which is can one political tribe estimate the beliefs of another political tribe?

So can Democrats accurately assess what they think Republicans believe as measured by what = percent of them say they believe that? And can Republicans accurately assess what Democrats believe? And what they found is that the more people use social media, the worse that they were at estimating what other people believe, meaning the bigger the gap between what they perceive the other side believing and what they actually believe.

And so I think that’s just a really important point, because no matter what you feel or believe or think is true or real, the important thing is that we have an exaggerated view of the gap between things the other side believes, the most extreme version instead of the reality.

EJ: And it’s interesting because I have a libertarian friend who will use the example of the wristwatch. He’ll say, you know, there is a tech panic. We wouldn’t think of it as tech. But at the time it was technology, the wristwatch. And people at the time were becoming sort of obsessed with looking at their wrist and checking the time.

And people were concerned about this. And there’s similar reports from the mirror. I mean, you can go back to basically any aspect of technology. Absolutely. There is some sort of moral panic about it. But what those technologies, with maybe the exception of the printing press didn’t do, was transfer vast swaths of our personal and professional lives to those devices or to the smartphone.

And the smartphone has the social media on it. And as somebody who’s been around for a huge part of the history, the young history of the sort of common tech or the modern tech industry, how much of this is smartphones? How much of this is social media and how much is the combination of both? Because there was AOL Instant Messenger that could be very addicting, but you had to go dial up and yeah, a desktop and you had to go to a special room in your house where the desktop was and dial up the Internet to get on air.

TH: I remember those days.

EJ: Right. The smartphone seems to play a big role in all of this as well.

TH: So I’m so glad you bring this up because let’s steelman instead of strawmanning the opposing view here. OK, so the opposing view is I saw The Social Dilemma. It sounds like a moral panic where we’ve always been worried about new technologies when they arrive on the scene, you know, television, radio, rock and roll. Elvis was shaking his hips.

Reefer madness, right. And there have been moral panics about all sorts of new technologies every time one new one arrives. So I want to name and acknowledge the full history of that phenomena of culture, having a moral panic about something new. I think the difference between, let’s say, a wristwatch and say social media. Now, take the example of how it’s affecting children if I’m like a 15 year old and I’m in high school and all my friends use Instagram, not just to post photos of their lives, which they do, but they also do their communication through Instagram.

Meaning I think a lot of adults who might be listening to your podcast might not get this, that teenagers actually might use Instagram as their primary way of messaging their friends. So there’s kind of been making plans like I can’t participate in my social life without using Instagram as a messaging app. But Instagram bundles the messaging with the infinite feed of We got an eye pointed at your brain stem to figure out and reverse engineer what’s going to resonate with your nervous system.

And that’s the next video, photo or thing we’re going to show you based on what was most engaging for you. And so a wristwatch that you put on your wrist didn’t control your social, whether you were excluded from your friends social group. Whereas social media and Instagram have controlled and taken over what it means to be participating in a society.

If I’m a politician, can I win an election without having an Instagram profile or a Facebook profile or a Twitter profile? Well, a few, maybe a while ago, you could do it, but now you can’t. Right. And the ones that do use these platforms are going to get an advantage. But the advantage that they get is in a bad game because they have to basically say the most extreme things that their follower base are going to respond to.

And so they’re not actually responding to their real constituents proportionately. They’re responding to the constituents that are resonating on social media. But social media has this amplification factor on the more you say an extreme thing about a cultural fault line, you add inflammation to that cultural fault line will pay you in more likes and followers that that’s the conversation with Elon, by the way, is you know, how do we fix Twitter?

It’s like it’s not just about speech versus censorship. That’s an important conversation. But the real problem with Twitter is it is a video game that I log into every day and I’m paid in more likes and followers. I get paid only ten points if I add information to a cultural fault line versus I get paid one point.

If I say, you know, here’s what I think the other side might be. Actually, I get paid negative points. If I say, here’s something I think the other side is thinking about that we should consider. We don’t get paid by acting in a good way. You get paid by being, you know, provocative. And people will say that’s no different than any other media.

But that has changed when you have an algorithm of Twitter that’s reinforcing things that you’ve already clicked on, and that’s different and unprecedented in the time of media. So hopefully that is true. Some of the concerns on this is a new and distinct issue no.

EJ: I mean, and this is one of the things that I found myself explaining to just slightly younger people, because the rate of change has gotten so quick that, you know, you can be a vastly different have vastly different life experience just by being a little bit younger. But anywhere you go with your phone, the difference between what you’re not looking at when you’re not looking at your phone, when you are looking at your phone could be the best news of your life. It could be the worst news of your life. And if you don’t look at your phone at that given moment, you might be missing it.

And that’s very different than even the beeper, than the telephone. There’s just no there’s nothing there’s no precedent for that in human history. And I guess I’m curious as to in your experience how aware these companies are. You know, Google might say, listen, we’re working on this. We’ve hired design ethicists. We have, you know, put a portion of our profits into ethical design.

TH: I need to answer that question because you asked that earlier, actually, about how does one get that job? Are there many design ethicists? Actually, I mean, but just to briefly clarify, there was no job for design ethicist at Google or Apple or Twitter or Facebook or anything like that. I didn’t apply for a job. I again, the people remember The Social Dilemma, which I recommend anybody who hasn’t seen watch The Social Dilemma.

I go through the history of my own trajectory, which is that I became concerned about this arms race for attention and then made up a slide deck basically that I sent to just 15 friends and colleagues at Google wanting to get feedback, saying, hey, I’m worried that this arms race for attention is going to value humans more when they’re addicted, distracted, outraged, polarized and misinformed and narcissistic and that that’s going to kind of break the way society works.

And then instead of it just being sent to those 15 people, they started sending it to other people. And within basically 48 hours it had spread to, you know, 40,000 people at Google. And then through the success of that presentation and some executives seeing it, I either was going to quit or I was going to be in this position where I can maybe research what do we do about this problem?

And to the generosity, maybe you could say of Google, they allowed me to research, how do you think about this question? How do you ethically design the environment in which applications compete for attention and news competes for attention? So I did that for a few years. But unfortunately, even though I tried very hard to change Android and Chrome and some of the core interfaces that could be changed, they would say, actually, if we do this, it will look paternalistic for Google to make these top down changes.

And it was clear to me that we needed to create a public awareness movement, and that’s why it came out on 60 Minutes. That’s when The Social Dilemma came out all that work coming out to the public was to create more public awareness that this is a massive problem and we have to do something about it.

EJ: You know, I’ve known people who have changed their phones to grayscale as I’m sure you have, and that might even be mentioned in Social Dilemma. But how aware are people when they are engineering these products, when they’re coming up with the new way for Facebook, for instance, they just announced they’re doing more of what TikTok does. And instead of circulating content from people already in your network, they’re going to be circulating and pushing more content from outside your network.

How aware are people in these positions down to the colors, down to all of this in terms of designing it to capture our attention, designing these things like slot machines? In terms of the psychology, how aware are people in those positions of kind of exactly what they’re doing on the granular detail level?

TH: It’s a great question. So first of all, I think there’s a lot of justification. If you work at Facebook or Twitter or TikTok today, you point to the thousand positive examples of things that happened today in the world because of what you were doing. So on Facebook, I point to blood donors who got to meet with other blood donors for rare diseases.

I see cancer support groups. I see the people who lost their horse. And then because of someone on Facebook tagged on, they found the horse. And I see the examples of, you know, Hollywood. I mean, high school sweethearts reconnecting because they found each other. So I can point to a list of a thousand amazing things that happened today because of the existence of social media.

And if I’m TikTok, I’d make a similar list about all the creative findings. I say, here’s all these these creators that now have an entire lifestyle and economic well-being. You know, they basically have a job where they can make money from just being creative and making videos. So I can point to all those examples of the goods.

Now you see a different question. Are they aware of the design choices that they make that are manipulative? I think this is a very interesting question. The people at the very top of the company, I think are aware like I forgot his name, the guy who runs TikTok, and also Zuckerberg, I think are both very aware because anybody who was there in the early days, the way that Facebook got successful was by manipulating human, social, psychological vulnerabilities.

The clear example of Facebook was photo tagging. I don’t know if you were in college when that, I was a sophomore at Stanford when that feature came out. The Facebook was like months old. And for those who don’t remember or know this history, they created the feature where you don’t just upload a photo of some stuff that’s in your life.

And, you know, this is back when you had to do on a desktop computer and do it manually from a digital camera.

EJ: You had to plug the camera in. Yeah.

TH: It’s funny. How that’s like history now, right? So but they added a feature called photo tagging so I could tag, you know, Tristan, and then in front of all of his friends, he would know that he was tagged in a photo by Emma, and then he’d say, Oh my God, Emma tagged me in the photo, I should, like, respond to that.

Or I have to, I have to make sure it’s a good photo. Otherwise I have to take it down and that was the best way to just get people getting sucked into Facebook for hours and hours a day. Because now all these photos are linked to people’s faces and names and you’re clicking through photos and you’re tapping into people’s vanity and sense of social validation.

And Zuckerberg and his team knew exactly what they were doing when they designed that feature. And they, you know, in different cases when they invented the like button, they thought they were spreading love and positivity in the world, but they also knew they were creating a feedback mechanism. And if you post something and instead of getting no feedback, you suddenly within minutes or seconds you would get ten likes or something like that, that that would be an addictive feature because you suddenly you have this reason to post and you know, you can get some dopamine and some oxytocin and serotonin from just dosing people with likes so they knew what they were doing when TikTok invented the, you know, the infinite scroll for, you know, for second video interface that you just infinitely go through, they know that if they remove the stopping cues, meaning they make it so that it automatically scrolls to the next video. They hide the clock, for example. They know exactly what they’re doing. Actually, a metaphor for listeners isin the casino.

Many of you may know that the designers of the casino actually hide clocks because they want you to lose track of time while you’re in the environment. They want you thinking about time. I didn’t realize it until recently, but if you’re using a TikTok on an iPhone that doesn’t have the notch at the top, but a flat top, TikTok will hide the clock on your phone because they don’t want you thinking about what time it is and how much time has passed since you’ve been scrolling.

These are deliberate design choices, and they do optimize down to the color, down to the, you know, the animations, down to the speed and time it takes for the new video to load. This is all optimized like a machine, and the results of which is that when we’re the product and not the customer, we are worth mor again, when we are addicted, distracted, outraged, narcissistic, validation, seeking and polarized than we are as healthy democratic citizens or as growing children. Right?

These people who are designing streaks on Snapchat, which show the number of days in a row that kids have sent a message to their friend, which they did just to addict people. Because now if you if you’ve been sending a message to your best friend for 30 days, in a row, now if there’s 30, there’s a number 30 and a fireball next to your name, I don’t want that number 30 to go away just like that I’ve been working at the gym for ten days in a row. It makes it harder to not go the next day, but they’re using that not to help me go to the gym more often, which I might independently choose. They’re using that to support their goal of driving you to keep engaging. And that’s the problem.

EJ: I had a 700 day snap streak once.

TH: Wow. OK, so tell me then, so you have it for share. I mean, I might sound like I’m spinning a conspiracy theory, but it was probably pretty hard to to let go of that 700 day streak, right?

EJ: It was accidental. Yeah, it was. it was really a traumatic moment when the streak went away because my friend that I had it with was in a different time zone. And we just we lost track and it got messed up. But I’m curious what the R&D looks like in that space. Like, is this informed by scientists? Is it AB tested? Is it focus grouped? I mean, how do they optimize these platforms to function in that machine-like way, they’re optimized for this addiction and for keeping you engaged?

TH: The word is engagement. That’s the word everybody should know is what is engagement. It means seven day actives, meaning users who have been active in the last seven days. That number should go up. The number of sessions that you’ve engaged with per day that should go up, the number of amount of minutes per procession should go up.

The number of total users should go up. The number of users who invite other users should go up. That’s all engagement that was captured in The Social Dilemma where you had the artificial intelligence robot guy sitting behind the control screen that’s basically in a control room that’s trying to increase, you know, time spent advertising per minute spent and then also how many users you invite because all those drive up engagement.

So at this point and even back then, it was pretty well known how to manipulate people’s social psychology. And again, I mentioned, you know, there is a field called Persuasive Technology, which I want to make sure I’m very clear. B.J Fogg, the professor who created this field and wrote the book on Persuasive Technology, who I studied with. He wanted he warned the FTC and I think the late nineties about the ethics of persuasive technology and the need to regulate the space because it’s going to turn into a huge problem.

And he’s not the evil guy with the mustache, you know, twisting it to say, how can I ruin the world? He really was trying to actually use persuasive technology for good. He actually created a whole initiative. How do you use persuasive technology to create more peace in the world. So he did a lot of things there, but there’s a whole space in which once you show people, once there’s this increasing encyclopedia of techniques of how to manipulate people.

And again, I was a magician as a kid, so I knew that there’s a hundred techniques to manipulate people, sense of cause and effect attention, their reasoning, their memory of what happened. There’s a thousand techniques and most people don’t want to admit this is true, but it is totally true. It’s just built into how our minds work. And behavioral economics kind of reinforced that.

And there’s a bunch of conferences in Silicon Valley, in books. There’s a guy named Ariel who had a conference called Hooked, and I spoke at it once. And I remember distinctly he had the head of growth at Pinterest. They’re giving a talk and he said, Now, what would happen if a user gets burnt out and they stopped using the service like a drug lord?

It’s like you stopped using what do they do then? What? He said, Oh, that’s no problem. You just do the following ten techniques and it gets them using it right again, right back. And that’s what people should know is that there is an entire discipline to about how to kind of influence people psychology and it wasn’t done because they wanted to wreck the world.

It’s they wanted to be successful for their business. But the underlying terrain, on top of which that success would be built, was by degrading the soil out of which our society grows. Right? It’s like you’re telling the soil for, you know, for children’s development, how their minds work and you instead of saying, how do we cultivate that soil?

So it grows the best children and, you know, you know, maturity and, you know, healthy development in the world, they’re just saying, how do we keep kids addicted to Snapchat? How do we keep kids addicted to TikTok? And it works really, really well. And I recommend for any parents out there, you have to note, this is not built for the health of your kids and simply limiting the time that they spend is like saying, well, I’ll just limit the amount of heroin that I get every day to like a few milligrams.

So let’s just not give the kids heroin and let’s remove their social communication from an environment which is dominated by that kind of heroin. Like how do we get communication out of that space? There’s a great organization called Fairplay that used to be called the Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood that has been working on that for a long time.

And we’re all allies trying to liberate essentially humidity from the shackles of this manipulative environment.

EJ: Yeah, and you know, it’s your personal lives and your politics. It’s everything that’s in the heroin is informing every conversation that we have. And Social Dilemma came out. I think it was like right on the cusp of TikTok becoming really big. I know you’ve been doing some work in the national security space, too, which is a huge conversation, obviously, when it comes to TikTok which, is now, I think the number one website in America. What stands out to you? You just sort of talked about it a little bit, but what about TikTok stands out to you and in this context of the attention economy?

TH: OK, I’m so glad you asked this question. And I think it’s just the most critical thing. And also from a national security perspective, if I could get the U.S. national security community to ban TikTok right now, I would. And we’ll get into that. Let’s quickly talk about how to TikTok, as you mentioned recently, overtook YouTube and Facebook and Instagram and I think engagement time.

I can’t remember which place it might be globally. Or in certain markets, but they have basically eaten the lunch of all the other social media companies. In fact, I actually I was at a events theater a couple of months ago and a woman came up to me. She said, oh, I saw The Social Dilemma. Thank you so much, I stopped using all social media. Now I just use Ti​​kTok. And I was really sad by that. Because the real message of the film is not You should be angry at one or two of these apps. It’s the race to the bottom of the brain stem to get attention that thing is going to hurt human humanity and TikTok, the way to beat Facebook and YouTube in the attention wars and the race to the bottom of the brain stem is they optimized for one thing, which is you’re watching a video and I’m going to point the biggest supercomputer in the world sitting in Beijing at your brain stem and your kid’s brain stem and at your uncle who you know, and I’m going to calculate the perfect next video to show that and it will know you better than you know yourself. It will know what will keep you there better than your prefrontal cortex or the part of your brain that basically has your willpower and says, oh, I have to do something else. It will calculate how to defeat your prefrontal cortex.

People should be very concerned because the Chinese Communist Party has influence over ByteDance, which is the company that owns TikTok.

TikTok has basically become the number one social media app around the world. Would you have allowed the Soviet Union during the Cold War to basically control television programing for all Western democracies and pick what they see and they don’t see? I mean, it is absolutely insane that we’ve allowed this to happen.

And by the way, for those who think that I’m being, you know, a conspiracy theorist, or xenophobic, China does not allow any U.S. social media platforms in their country. So they don’t have Facebook or Twitter because they think the U.S. would be running an influence operation on their citizens. Why? Given the fact that that’s their worldview, would we assume anything less than they would intend to use this platform for psychological?

And for most people, they think about TikTok. They’ve heard in the news about the U.S. government’s concerns about data and that they’re going to, TikTok will basically siphon up all this data on Americans. That’s true. But I’m even more worried about them being able to remotely influence basically the next president, the United States. They can say, yeah, we want it to be this person.

They can look at all the voting districts in the swing states and they can say per zip code. I mean, I don’t need Frank Luntz, the political pollster, because I can basically look at people’s sentiments with an AI that calculates what people’s opinions are in all the key voting areas. And then I can strategically up regulate everybody who starts to say, you know, China’s really not so bad.

We should look more what they’re doing. If China were to invade Taiwan tomorrow, they could up regulate all the American voices who are saying that Taiwan was always a part of China. And I was actually talking to a U.S. senator who said, who do you think the Chinese government considers the biggest rival to its power? And of course, you would think it’s like the United States but they said, no, no, no.

They consider their own technology companies to be the biggest rival to the CCP. And for those who don’t know, China actually massively regulates its own technology company. So if you use TikTok in China, when you scroll, you don’t get influencer videos. They actually feature science experiments you can do at home, educational content, patriotism videos. They have closing hours and opening hours.

It actually goes lights out at 10 p.m. They limit you to 40 minutes a day because they want their kids to be scientists, astronauts and engineers, and they want their military to be successful in the future. And where they’re happy to ship the version of TikTok, that’s essentially opium for the masses to the entire West and I think it’s like a reversal of those, you know, history. You know, what they call the great humiliation, which is when their society fell behind because of opium. This is kind of a reversal of that and I don’t think it’s because of one diabolical plan. I think that there’s this Chinese company that was just super successful at playing this game called The Race to the Bottom of the Brainstem.

And now the West has to respond.

EJ: Unbelievable. And I guess there was a Sarah Fisher report in Axios just yesterday about how Oracle is now auditing TikTok data and that was both on two fronts. It was on the front of privacy, and it’s on the front of algorithmic control. And, you know, it’s sort of like, look at Oracle’s doing this and they’re going to, you know, disincentivize any sort of nefarious behavior on behalf of the CCP in the United States.

But it’s also incredibly hard to trust that process. So just on what do you think about is that a solution going forward of TikTok, is that something that’s really a meaningful step in a better direction?

TH: Well, I think on the Oracle side, that’s about data. So where is the data going? Where is it getting stored? Who has access to it? Oracle could provide some slightly more trust in that area, but how would we know that TikTok is not manipulating which content people are seeing in all the swing states? TikTok, for example, does not release to researchers a what’s called an API or something where you can researchers can basically look at the full firehose of all the videos. Twitter, for example, does offer that firehose or researchers can actually, you know, do computation and analytics and math on what is actually moving through through Twitter and what is getting amplified, what, you know, what are the networks of, you know, where teams are traveling TikTok doesn’t offer that.

So they could and they’ve already done this, by the way, there’s been research by the Tech Observatory at UC Berkeley that has been studying, especially how TikTok was influenced during this war in Ukraine, where because Russia passed what they call the, quote, fake news law in which basically if you said it’s at the beginning of the war, all the videos that were posted on TikTok, most of them from around the world were against Putin. And after Russia passed the fake news law, because they have a lot of citizens who use a TikTok. I was told just today, this morning that Russia is the fifth biggest market for TikTok in the world. So, you know, this is a big market but because they’re allied, TikTok basically no longer pushes any pro-Ukraine content and anti Russia content. And all the videos that you see are, you know, why Putin’s great and why the war is justified and everything else. And again, that’s slightly more visible. But they never announced that they were making that change.

So TikTok can we actually know that they have the controls to flip a switch. And in certain countries, they can basically make people feel one way or the other and they can do that per country.

If I was China and the CCP, I would take TikTok and remotely influence, you know, all of Africa. So along with my debt traps that I’ve laid for all the African nations and building airports and then putting them in debt to have influence over them in the future. I would also use TikTok to make people think in Africa that, hey, look, this is Putin just actually fighting back against Nato.

This is totally justified and I could basically control and gerrymander the future votes of other countries and my soft power to coordinate how the world works. So we’re going all the way from email addiction and pulling to refresh in the slot machine all the way up to a geopolitical power game. But I really, really want people to get just how critical this is.

And I think it’s something that everyone can be aligned on, it’s not a partisan issue.

EJ: No, it’s not at all. And you’ve been having these conversations increasingly, I know, with people in politics, with people in business. And, you know, you just mentioned having this conversation with a U.S. senator. Are you finding that some of this is like completely unchartered territory to the point where people don’t, haven’t this put two and two together because it’s happening so quickly?

And it’s so new that when you do explain it to them, they get the gravity of it or is it still just sort of hazy?

EJ: So the meta problem, as it were in media, I don’t mean Facebook Meta, I mean the Meta of the problem, but that’s about the problems. We go back to E.O. Wilson to answer your question, which is that the fundamental problem of humanity is we have Paleolithic brains and emotions, medieval institutions and God like accelerating technology. And it’s so important to come back to that because you know, it is always the case that technology moves faster than institutions.

You know, we get cars before we get seatbelts in traffic lights, we get railroads before we get the regulation of railroads, we get dynamite before we realize, hey, we should actually not sell dynamite in every, you know, CVS down the corner, which, by the way, you used to be able to get. So we don’t usually realize that we’ve created a God like technology until afterwards.

And it needs some kind of guardrails. And guardrails is what we’re looking for here, not free speech, ministry of truth. We’re looking for. How do we set up the incentives in some safe ways for this to work? But I think the problem to answer your question, talking to U.S. senators or national security leaders, you’re sort of saying, hey, do they do they put two and two together?

I think slowly some are. But you have to paint the whole picture. Because if I’m a general that went to West Point and trained in all this military theory and, you know, I know about, you know, the position of all the U.S. Navy and, you know, where the nukes are. And I know how to think about the power calculus.

And I worked at the office of net assessment at the Pentagon or all that stuff. Why would I know what my 14 year old daughter is doing on TikTok or that China might be just influencing certain zip codes? Like how would that reach my dashboard? And there’s all sorts of cases, even after 9-11, where there’s an institutional gap where we have some institutions, we have a Space Force and we have a Navy and we have an Air Force, we don’t have a Metaverse force.

We don’t have a social media defense force. And I do think that population centric psychological warfare is the new is one of the new modes of warfare along with cyber warfare. I don’t have to actually have F-35 to match you in kinetic military capacity if I can actually do a cyber attack and, you know, hack the Colonial Pipeline, which later was released, apparently that the Colonial Pipeline was two days away from basically having major cascading effects that could have shut down the U.S. economy if it’s just been two days longer than it was and a cyber weapon cost a lot less than an F-35 and a social media weapon that makes your population angry at each other so that all the energy goes into …because everyone’s just fighting with each other all the time. And meanwhile, I’m just playing chess and beating you by routing around all your decisions. That’s the thing I want to shake people out of. It’s like the US has to reboot its society a bit into a 21st century society that also has a positive view of how tech can be embraced.

I think the last thing is, you know, China is consciously employing the full suite of 21st Century technologies from big data to A.I. surveillance to quantum computing and to make a stronger form of authoritarian society, a society that we wouldn’t want in with Western values, but they’re consciously employing tech plus authoritarianism equals stronger, better authoritarianism. Meanwhile, democracies are not consciously employing the full suite of tech to make stronger democracies.

Instead, we have allowed private tech companies to profit from degrading democracies into not working as well as they need to. So we can’t just be satisfied with slightly less toxic social media. I want to move to a world where tech plus democracy equals stronger democracy that has an embrace of tech, not an opposition to tech. And that’s a nuance people might not expect from me because they think Social Dilemma is kind of a Luddite film or something.

EJ: Well, the Gmail example that you gave earlier is really sticking with me because speaking of Meta, when you described looking around a cafe and seeing how more than half of the people were on Gmail and people keep it open all day and in some sense it is this very physical workspace. It’s become over, especially after the pandemic and going forward even more so. And I have an Oculus and I see the programs that they have for people to work virtually, to work in the metaverse. And they’re kind of crude right now. But we know that one of the most powerful companies in the world, Meta, is investing really heavily on making those spaces, well, addictive in the same way that Gmail was being made addictive.

But despite the fact that this was on everybody’s laptops at the cafe, that company didn’t have a team working on the ethics of it, period. Even though it was consuming so much time, so much of the world’s time, and being controlled by a fairly, you know, small team compared to the rest of the world. And in Northern California, so I’m wondering what you think is at stake in the metaverse.

I remember Sheryl Sandberg in the pandemic basically bragging about talking to faith leaders, about getting their churches into the metaverse. And that might sound great in the same way that a lot of other steps in tech sounded really great. But what ends up happening is you have control of your worship spaces, you have control of your political spaces, in the hands of one company.

So what worries you? Or maybe what gives you optimism about the metaverse going forward?

TH: Well, I think we’ve already seen how positively framed mission statements like we’re going to connect the whole world together and we’re going to bring the world closer together, which was the new mission statement for Facebook or, you know, we’re going to host the, you know, the public square for Twitter. Each of those positive mission statements and narratives were not what the underlying machines that they built were designed to optimize for.

Like Facebook was not designed to make the world more open and connected. It was designed for engagement. What can I show you? What can I get you invited to? What can I tag you with that keeps you coming back to this system over and over again? That’s what they’re designing for. And there’s a gap between the mission statement and what the machine is optimized for.

Same thing with Twitter. It is also a place where people can publicly post their thoughts to the whole world. But the actual machine, like if you talked to the engineers, how are they incentivized? What are they literally performance bonuses? So if I’m an employee at Twitter and I work on the newsfeed, how do I, like make a bonus?

Well, I showed that engagement went up by 10% while I was working on this feature. And that’s what gets me my bonus next year. And so long as that’s how the incentives are structured, we’re going to see those results. So when you ask about VR and the metaverse, we’re going to hear the same thing. We’re going to hear the positive narrative story. We can be able to connect the world and connect church groups together, and people are going to spend time together.

There’s all those things could happen, and many of them will be positive. But that’s not the machine that they have built. The 10,000 engineers that they want to hire to build VR in the metaverse are not going to be asked to say, how do we, you know, liberate the best of humanity, they’re going to be tasked with how do we make our VR platform the most engaging and addictive it can be, especially so long as it outcompete the other VR platforms.

So it’s another race to the bottom of the brainstem. Now to leave people with some hope, you know, in the social media world before we get to VR. But in the regular, today’s world, Apple is one of the interesting actors that I think needs to have far more pressure put upon them because they often get away with they’re definitely not one of the bad guys, and that makes them a good guy because they’re not a social media company and they don’t optimize for engagement.

And their business model is selling you a new phone every two years. And I also want to applaud the things that they have done, the privacy tracking features that they’ve done, the screen time features, the Do Not Disturb features. You know, these are all in the direction of more humane technology. And when Tim Cook announced, by the way, that they were doing these privacy tracking features, he said out loud, We cannot allow a social dilemma to become a social catastrophe.

So they’re on board. But Apple could do so much more to change, if you will, almost like the digital Constitution for how all apps can and cannot behave. So if we want a Geneva Convention in this arms race for attention, Apple could implement it because all the apps have to live in their app store and you know, people would say, well, Apple, that has too much power.

We shouldn’t have a private entity like they have too much, which is exactly true. We shouldn’t have. You know, which is the point you were also making, is the VR world going to get owned by $1 trillion, you know, $2 trillion tech companies? That’s not a good environment. We need to be in the democratic interest. So we have to figure out some different governing structure but I do think that short term, if you wanted to change all the perverse stuff that we’ve laid out in the last hour, I think that Apple could a year from now, within less than a year from now, ship on the next iPhone, a different set of rules that says you can’t do auto playing videos for underage kids and then no end. A lot of playing videos for underage kids and suddenly you’ve solved the TikTok problem. And they’re already making changes that are in this direction. We just need to demand so much more.

EJ: Yeah. I mean, it’s amazing. That’s kind of my next question, I was going to ask you about the Farhad Manjoo column “I was wrong about Facebook” in that long series of mea culpas that The New York Times tasked its editorial staff to do.

TH: To be honest, I actually haven’t seen those. Could you say more about them?

EJ: Yeah, no, absolutely. So they all had this challenge where they issued a mea culpa, something they were wrong about. So some of them were, you know, very political, some of them were more cultural. And Farhad’s was “I was wrong about Facebook.” And he wrote “The site has crossed a threshold. It is now so widely trafficked that it’s fast becoming a routine aid to social interaction like email and antiperspirant.”

And it’s a sort of a clever way of putting it, but a very true one. And the big question here is whether there’s a way really to put the toothpaste back in the tube. There are some even bigger questions about what it means that people on one side of the world I mean, I think about TV. Walter Cronkite broadcasting from Vietnam.

Betty White was on an experimental broadcast of TV, and she passed away in the age of TikTok. The stuff is just moving so quickly and connecting people from different cultures so quickly that in ways that were never envisioned and were not clearly keeping up with the rate of change. So is there a way to sort of put the toothpaste back in the tube and have a healthier economy or is it sort of, it should we be more defeatist and practice some sort of Benedict option to just get out while we can?

TH: Yeah, well, I think it’s important to note and again, I don’t want to say let’s copy China, but notice it’s almost like they saw The Social Dilemma and they enacted a whole horizontal, you know, slate of reforms right there. They don’t let 14 year olds, they limit you know time they do opening hours and closing hours so that no one has to use it at ten after 10 p.m. because there’s no social pressure that that your friends are not continuing to tag you and stuff at 11 p.m. and midnight and one in the morning now you’re not getting sleep like they’re enacting a whole suite of reforms.

I think that tech plus democracy can equal stronger democracy. I think the question is, what is adequate to accomplish that goal? Is just privacy legislation that limits the amount of data that they can collect going to get us to a world where the actual personalized engagement driven news feeds and on playing videos for 3 seconds are not going to continue to ruin your kids attention and mental health? Privacy doesn’t get you all the way there if you have antitrust and you just break them up into, you know, from two or three companies that are pursuing engagement, too. Now you have 100 companies that are even more aggressive in the race to the bottom of the brainstem. That also doesn’t get you to a world where they’re not racing for that engagement.

So we have to change the underlying North Star from engagement to something that actually has some public interests at heart. But you can’t be affecting children without caring about children and families getting better throws the technology not worse. If you know, tech plus attention has people better attention. Tech plus family should equal stronger families. Tech plus kids should equal better, healthier, better educated kids.

Now, that might sound uncomfortable, some people, but when you realize just how central it is, it’s like roads plus cities should equal, you know, better transportation for the whole city. Like the city should be humming along as a better, healthier you know, more functioning city with higher bandwidth and more throughput. And what we need is for social media to be like that.

But for the way our society works at a more comprehensive level, and I do think, like I said, that you’re kind of asking people to put the toothpaste back in the bottle. You know, we might need to kill a few cancer cells, like there’s some bad cancer cells out there. And I want a name that if a cancer cell has a social responsibility council or an advisory board or something like that, like it’s still a cancer cell, you know, if a cancer cell has a a research department to sort of give transparency reports about how how it’s affecting various organs, it’s still a cancer cell while it’s giving you that transparency we have to change the DNA of Facebook, Twitter, TikTok from the cancer cells that they are for our society into something that’s actually healthy.

Now, we can either do that through regulation and actually forcing and deepening a change that has to comprehensively hit the way the employees and the incentives are structured. Or we also probably need some better newer platforms that are more optimized from the ground up to strengthen the way society works.

I know that might sound bold and aggressive, but I also think that’s the size of the kind of 21st Century digital democracy we should be living in too, which is the only way we’re going to compete with China anyway.

EJ: No, absolutely. I mean, on the right, people come all the time pitching their new social networks. I remember talking to the CEO of Parler a couple of years ago and saying, Well, speech stuff, great. What are you going to do differently than Twitter in terms of addictiveness? Because if you can’t answer that question I’m not interested in this product as a solution to the problems.

So let’s end on that. Tristan, is there reason for optimism? Is the mood in Silicon Valley one of innovation right now? Are people trying to come up with these ideas and these products, or is there still a brick wall? Or is it maybe a combination of all of those things?

TH: So I think I’ve been working on this for close to ten years now. And so there’s been a lot of patience and I want to, I’m sure a lot of people might be feeling pretty daunted by what we’ve kind of laid out, if it is so comprehensively, you know, toxic to many of the core support structures of the way our society works.

And I’m sure that they’re like, it’s a hard thing to look at every day. But back in 2013, if you told me that Facebook stock price would be cut in half, which it recently was through the Apple privacy changes that happened that the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, would be saying we can’t allow a social dilemma to become a social catastrophe, that the attorney generals, just like they did for Big Tobacco, created a lawsuit that increased the costs that changed the business of tobacco from being a social norm to now being a defunct industry.

They did the same thing. We have an energy lawsuit for a consumer harms to kids that is now emerging. We have employees coming out and whistleblowers coming out, giving transparency to some of the externalities that have been hidden for a long time. We have, you know, Apple making changes in the right positive direction. We have culture and regulators starting to catch on.

We had the EU, at least, that’s passing the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act. So we’re seeing way more movement than we’ve ever seen in the ten years that at least I’ve been working on this. And I want people to feel the momentum because it is picking up and picking up speed do I think that Facebook or Twitter or TikTok have taken in this critique and said, you know what, you’re right, we have to totally transform everything we’re doing now and I also don’t expect them to.

There’s a great line by Upton Sinclair, the American author. “You cannot get someone to question something that their salary depends on them not seeing,” and I think that Zuckerberg has built his identity, and just like the guy from TikTok and just like any of the companies you built your identity and your wealth around the success of something that does do some benefit in the world.

But the optimization for engagement produces externalities and costs that live on the balance sheet of society, that break that society. And we can no longer afford those things. So whether they recognize it or not, I don’t want to wait for their consciousness to emerge. I want to make sure we get there through all the means possible through national security, through litigation, through employees coming out through Apple, making the relevant changes and creating the Geneva Convention.

There’s ways that this could change within a year from now in a pretty dramatic way. But we would need all those sectors acting at the level that we need to. We would need national security saying, hey, this is going to be a tier one priority in the national security strategy.

You know, you could have these kinds of changes happen really quickly, but we need a focused effort from all these sectors acting a once.

EJ: Move fast and put things back together. Maybe that’s the new motto going forward.

TH: You said it, not me.

EJ: Well, Tristan, thank you so much for your time and your insights and all of the work that you do in this space. I think it is some of the most important work in American politics and culture and honestly in the world right now. So thank you for joining Federalist Radio Hour.

TH: So good to be with you. I really hope everyone takes this to heart and wherever you are listening to this, like in ways that you can contribute to this whole system moving, please do. Because I think a lot of people look at that and say somehow, you know, it’s going to change on its own. And we just do need everybody talking about it and making it a central issue.

We found even talking to the national security community, it was through their children who were affected by it, who saw Social Dilemma, who recommended it to their parents, who are in, you know, top positions that led to some of the change. So change can happen from a lot of places. Just keep that in mind.

EJ: Yeah, I’ve heard that, too, actually. I’ve heard similar stories about Social Dilemma’s impact on people. And, you know, on an optimistic note, Sinclair, who you just cited, was also reacting to tech and tech that we have discovered better ways to deal with and all of the years since then. And parents, by the way, should go to the Center for Humane Technologies website and look at their Ledger of Harms.

If there are any members of Congress listening, their staff go to the Ledger of Harms. It’s incredibly useful. You and your team do a great job with that, Tristan.

TH: Thank you so much. Yeah, we try to put out as many resources we can. We also have a Foundations of Humane Technology course for technologists, and we have people from Apple, Facebook, you know, Google, the United Nations, all sorts of places that are taking it. That’s also to try to train technologies in a different way to think about these problems.

And that’s also helpful for regulators and other folks working on these issues. So we’re all doing the best we can.

EJ: Yeah so if folks are interested they can check out the Center for Humane Technology and listen to Your Undivided Attention podcast that Tristan is the co-host of.

Biden Left Taliban Billions In Weapons. Will Ukraine Differ?,"A new Department of Defense inspector general report released last week estimated that the Afghan government possessed $7.12 billion worth of equipment paid for by U.S. taxpayer dollars when it fell roughly a year ago, “much of which has since been seized by the Taliban.”

“This included military aircraft, ground vehicles, weapons, and other military equipment,” the release noted. “The condition of these items was unknown, and the long-term operability of the vehicles was likely to deteriorate without U.S. contractor maintenance.”

The actual amount of equipment left in Taliban hands may be far higher than the $7 billion figure. In August 2021, Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., reported the abandoned equipment cost more than $85 billion.

“Due to the negligence of this administration, the Taliban now has access to over $85 billion worth of American military equipment,” Banks said immediately after a congressional briefing. “That includes 75,000 vehicles, over 200 airplanes and helicopters, over 600,000 small arms and light weapons. The Taliban now has more Black Hawk helicopters than 85 percent of the countries in the world. … They also have night vision goggles, body armor, medical supplies.”

During the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan last year, social media was flooded with images of the invaders parading with U.S.-made weapons that American forces and the fleeing Afghan government left behind. Taliban fighters drove Humvees and armored SUVs adorned with the white Taliban flag through the streets and brandished American-made weapons.

Fast-forward a year, and the Biden administration and Congress have been shipping bushels of money to Ukraine as the Eastern European country fights its Russian invaders. If Russia continues to capture Ukrainian soil, what’s to keep American weapons and equipment from falling into the wrong hands just as they did in Afghanistan?

Our elected officials have spent $54 billion of Americans’ money on Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanding an ongoing payout of $7 billion per month to keep his government running. Just Friday, U.S. officials announced a new $775 million weapons package for Ukraine, including “15 ScanEagle surveillance drones,” “40 heavily armored MaxxPro mine-resistant vehicles,” and “TOW guided anti-tank missile systems, sixteen 105mm howitzers and 36,000 rounds.”

When Congress voted on a $40 billion package to Ukraine in May, Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube summarized: “less than 6 hours before a vote, the Democrats dropped a massive, last-minute bill to send $40 billion more without any safeguards, assurances of use, or proof of a strategic plan for the U.S. role in Ukraine.”

“I voted in April to approve a loan of U.S. military equipment to Ukraine and voted in March for $14 billion in military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine,” he continued. “Since then, Congress has not received a single report on how much of this funding was spent, if any, nor assurances that the funding even reached Ukraine.”

Even CNN admitted, “What happens to weapons sent to Ukraine? The US doesn’t really know,” before hand-waving the question with the absurd explanation that “It’s a conscious risk the Biden administration is willing to take.”

A June Department of Defense report broke down some of the weapons and equipment being sent to Ukraine on taxpayers’ dime, including:

Over 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; Over 6,500 Javelin anti-armor systems; Over 20,000 other anti-armor systems; Over 700 Switchblade Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems; 126 155mm Howitzers and 260,000 155mm artillery rounds; 36,000 105mm artillery rounds; 126 Tactical Vehicles to tow 155mm Howitzers; 19 Tactical Vehicles to recover equipment; Eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and ammunition; 20 Mi-17 helicopters; Hundreds of Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles; 200 M113 Armored Personnel Carriers; Over 10,000 grenade launchers and small arms; Over 59,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition; 75,000 sets of body armor and helmets; 121 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems; Laser-guided rocket systems; Puma Unmanned Aerial Systems; … 18 coastal and riverine patrol boats; M18A1 Claymore anti-personnel munitions; [and] Thousands of night vision devices, thermal imagery systems, optics, and laser rangefinders.

If Russia continues to overtake territory in Ukraine, it’s not unlikely some of that equipment and weaponry could fall into Russian hands. The Biden administration’s track record of incompetence — in its disastrously disorganized withdrawal from Afghanistan and in every other area — doesn’t lend itself to the belief that haphazardly pouring money and weapons into Ukraine is a calculated or “conscious risk,” as the CNN narrative-setters would have you believe. Rather, Biden’s handling of Ukraine suggests to the U.S. taxpayers whose money he is recklessly sending overseas that he’s learned little from a year ago.

Americans Are Paying For Government's Blind Support Of Ukraine,"Is there an amount of military aid for Ukraine the U.S. won’t approve? Within the past two weeks alone, the Biden administration has committed nearly $4 billion in security assistance by allocating $3 billion and $775 million in separate packages. The grand total of military aid delivered to Ukraine since President Biden took office in January 2021 is a whopping $13.5 billion, and that number is only set to increase.

What is particularly pernicious about the weapons gravy train is the lack of a clear endgame in the conflict itself, an ugly feature of U.S. engagement in proxy wars. When asked how long the war in Ukraine and, by extension, military aid will last, variations of “indefinitely” seem to be the going answers from U.S. leaders.

Such a position is amorphous and unrestrained, plunging the United States into deeper subsidization of European security and repeating the same mistakes made in arming proxies.

The latest round of military aid announcements underscores the absence of restraint on the part of U.S. leaders. In the aid announcement on Ukrainian Independence Day, the Department of Defense said the weapons package demonstrates “U.S. commitment to supporting Ukraine over the long term — representing a multi-year investment to build the enduring strength of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.”

Further, $3.5 billion in weapons from the nearly $4 billion pot will be made by the U.S. defense industry rather than come from existing U.S. stockpiles — a nice payday and additional job security for the military-industrial complex.

In the fast and furious arming of Ukraine, it seems both Congress and the White House forgot to ensure billions of dollars worth of weapons actually reach Ukrainian forces and don’t fall into the black market.

At a July press briefing, a senior DOD official was quoted saying, “We are not tracking weapons … And quite honestly, I mean, we feel pretty good that the Ukrainians are using the weapons that we’ve provided to them and have not seen any indications that those weapons have gone anywhere else other than to fight against the Russians.” This is quite the assertion to make if weapons aren’t being tracked.

The rapid delivery of weapons, entrenching the U.S. in years of new weapons contracts, and the complete lack of oversight in arms delivery is setting up U.S. involvement in Ukraine to become the latest in a string of U.S. proxy war failures that produce no tangible gains for U.S. security interests.

What is an acceptable end to the conflict that would bring U.S. support to a close? The large-scale arming of Ukraine is taking place with no clear mission or operational objectives. Buzzwords like “long-term gains,” “enduring strength,” and “defending democracy” communicate nothing practical.

Biden, parroting his European counterparts, said the U.S. will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” But the inability of U.S. leaders to connect billions in support for Ukraine to respond to a tangible threat directly impacting U.S. security is a symptom of a larger problem. European powers have spent decades relying on U.S.-funded defense via NATO, allowing defense spending and readiness on the continent to lapse. Rather than put pressure on Europe to own a large share of the responsibility in supporting Ukraine, the U.S. welcomed two new ill-equipped nations to NATO.

Such a dichotomy is problematic as it empowers Ukraine and the largest players in NATO to define for the U.S. the acceptable amount of arms, the conditions under which the conflict could end, and that the war in Ukraine must be considered a top national security priority. Ukraine has already taken such liberties.

In response to a question about Americans concerned with the level of spending on Ukraine, President Zelensky said, “As long as we are resisting it [Russian aggression], the integrity of the United States will continue, therefore we are giving our lives for your values and the joint security of the world… Inflation is nothing, Covid is nothing…”

With all due respect to Zelensky, American families facing skyrocketing living costs have every right to be skeptical of their government’s unrestrained and undirected support of a war in which the U.S. is not a declared participant. Further, Zelensky recently said his country will press on fighting Russia without “any concession or compromise,” a stance that puts the U.S. in an impossible position to suggest any peace negotiations that could end the war.

The U.S. committed itself to the war in Ukraine the moment the first package of military aid was announced post-Russian invasion. In undertaking yet another proxy war, the White House and Congress utterly failed the American people by abandoning all restraint.

Congress could have capped emergency spending. The White House could have toned down the “unwavering support” rhetoric. The Department of Defense could have put in place controls to track weapons deliveries before one bullet crossed into Ukraine. No facet of the U.S. government defined an endgame. As the threat of China’s retaking of Taiwan looms, cooler heads need to rise above the negative PR and devise an exit strategy for the U.S. from arming Ukraine.

The West Can’t Even Understand Why Russia Sees It As A Threat,"The eruption of war in Ukraine this year disrupted what President George Bush Sr. once called the “new world order” of the post-Soviet world, potentially realigning the globe’s geopolitical tectonic plates.

The conflict, in tandem with heightened stress about Taiwan, has aligned Russia and China more closely and highlights the so-called BRICS axis (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) as a potential alternative to the “global West” of the European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan, and ANZUS. This not only probably reflects resentment against alleged Western hubris and neocolonialism, but also highlights a deep fault line between two civilizational zones that cut across Ukraine.

That fault line becomes visible in comparing the now-secular “just war” tradition of the West and the “necessary war” tradition of still-overtly Christian polities of the East.

The ‘Necessary War’ Doctrine

The exiled Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin, the prime 20th-century articulator of the “necessary war” tradition, is sometimes called Russian President Vladimir Putin’s favorite philosopher. Putin has distributed copies of Ilyin’s books to officials across the Russian Federation.

A renowned Hegelian scholar and pioneer of Russian philosophy of law from before the Revolution, Ilyin in the 1920s became the unofficial philosopher of General Wrangel’s White Army movement against Communist totalitarianism and genocide. Ilyin has been unfairly labeled fascist by some “Antifa” historians, a claim that has been refuted by scholarship, his clear disavowal of Nazism, and the Gestapo targeting him in exile.

But the doctrine of the “necessary war” goes back all the way back to Byzantine times in Orthodox Christian social teaching. It involved a denial of any war being just.

St. Basil the Great, for example, wrote that it was best for a soldier who killed an enemy to be excommunicated for three years, even if he had killed legally in a right cause defending Christendom. The Byzantine princess Anna Comnena wrote in amazement of Latin-Norman ecclesiastical leaders arriving in the Near East armed as Crusaders when Byzantine bishops and clergy were forbidden from wielding arms.

Indeed, the Crusader war culture of the West left deeply negative memories in Orthodox Christian historiography. Western Crusaders were seen as having pillaged Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, dealing a long-term fatal blow to the Christian Empire. Northern Crusades wreaked havoc on Slavic Christian realms.

What Is a ‘Necessary War’?

In a 2003 study of Ilyin’s “necessary war” doctrine, University of Ottawa Prof. Paul Robinson contrasted the “just war” doctrine of the West with key aspects of “necessary war,” as found in Ilyin’s 1925 book “On the Resistance to Evil by Force.” Ilyin argued against Tolstoyan pacifism, which he said among pre-revolutionary Russian elites helped pave the way for the Communist takeover with its ensuing mass murders and cultural genocides.

For a war to be “necessary,” according to Ilyin: There must be “real evil,” not only suffering, but evil human will expressed in external deeds; such externalized evil human will must be recognized on a deep level as a prerequisite for fighting it; those fighting it need a “genuine love of good” and a repentant attitude in realizing the sinfulness of war on all sides; and its fighters need a “strong will” that is not indifferent to evil.

Force also becomes necessary only when other measures such as psychological coercion fail. (The latter point doesn’t mean that force is a last resort, as in Western “just war” doctrine, only that it becomes needed after any alternative deemed practical is exhausted.)

Russian “necessary war” doctrine parallels Dostoevsky’s philosophy of a common guilt for sin, which needs to be claimed through repentance and cannot be resolved simply through abstract legal views and processes. In that sense, there is larger complicity for the parricide of Fyodor Karamazov, for example.

To Ilyin, likewise, the spiritual causes of evil must be recognized within human souls. Fighting the external manifestations while leaving the roots intact will not lead to success, and there are unintended consequences and collateral damage in addressing merely the external. God and faith are integral factors in calculating a necessary war and repenting for it.

All of this paradoxically makes for an approach to war that is perhaps both more extremely skeptical and more likely in select cases. In any case, it literally leaves no justification for the Ukraine war from the standpoint of justice, even if deemed necessary.

The Rainbow Flag as a National Security Threat?

To Russian leaders, necessity in Ukraine seemed driven by an urgency to prevent or defuse the embedding of anti-Russian ideology militarily and culturally in what they see as a historic heartland of Russian community, ancient Kievan-Rus. But that necessity is illegible to Western elites because it involves no justification in Western intellectual terms, and because the West’s secular perspective today is fundamentally different from what Ilyin saw as the essential element of faith in addressing necessary war.

That Western pan-sexualism, for example, would be seen as effectively a national security threat due to its perceived impact on family structure and faith is inconceivable to Western leaders. For most of them, its promotion has become an explicit national security goal. In turn, this is inconceivable to Russian leaders.

The allegedly anti-Christian bias of the European Union and NATO’s “woke-ism,” the West pressing into the Russian sphere of influence after its support for overturning the Ukrainian government in 2014, a melding of secularized state and business interests in globalization that Russian leaders perceive as akin to the neopagan corporate statism of Nazism — these all describe for Kremlin leaders a claimed necessity to intervene militarily.

Psychologist Jordan Peterson pointed out there is no basis for psychological trust between Russia and the West today, because of what he terms the “civil war” culturally fragmenting the West and making it an impossible partner in negotiating a crisis. How, Peterson asked, could someone in another culture more traditional in view of sex and “ethno-nationalism” feel he could trust a United States where it is not clear that there is currently any coherent national identity nor normative cultural ethics?

Peterson gave as an example the spectacle this spring of congressional hearings in which the fractious question “What is a woman?” was unanswerable for a U.S. Supreme Court nominee, to the applause of many American elites. Given American elites’ overthrow of Founding Fathers, ideals, and documents, as well as family life and faith, where is the ethical North Star guiding American policy and trustworthiness abroad? It seems merely to be an assertion of a will to power in the name of a culturally revolutionary ideology.

China and Russia Believe the West Is Collapsing

Many suggest that if Donald Trump had been president, the Ukraine invasion would not have occurred. That’s not because he is a paragon of virtue, but because the power drive for expansion of the West in Ukraine would have been lessened in his realpolitik, and the nature of American leadership more legible to Putin.

In all this, cancel culture in American elite institutions has not served the United States well abroad. China’s recent analogy between U.S. policy on Taiwan and the strangling of George Floyd marked Beijing weaponizing American ideological rhetoric against itself. It was in line with how Chinese and Russian leaders (and many average people around the world) view American culture as collapsing in weakness. This is also signified by the derogatory Chinese term baizuo, for “crazy left white people.”

Of course, China’s use of Floyd was tactical at best, given Beijing’s atrocious record of dealing with minorities, let alone its lack of purging Mao as arguably the uber-mass murderer of the last century. Regardless, however, the concept of “just war” in a postmodern West must navigate the deconstruction of terms amid the loss of religious underpinning.

The West Is Still on a Crusade

Robinson notes that, by contrast with the Russian view of “necessary war,” the Western “just war” theory requires:

A just cause.

A just cause fought by legal authority.

A just cause having a reasonable sense of success.

Fighting should be a last resort after all alternatives (however impractical) are exhausted.

Violence must be proportional to the goals, and civilians should not be targeted.

Does the seemingly arbitrary Western tendency toward labeling some wars as just crusades enable both self-righteousness and a more impersonal and abstract sense of war (“fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian” through technological and financial aid)? Does it lead to hubris in intervening in Russia’s home neighborhood and risking huge casualties for others and nuclear confrontation?

Going back to the roots of theological difference between the West and East in old Christendom, the West tends to blame alleged “Caesaro-Papism” in the East for Russian brutal bellicosity. But the West has had its own problems with weaponizing a meld of ideology and culture historically.

The way the West obliviously pushed out the boundaries of NATO physically, and of its global consumer “Metaverse” culturally and economically, can easily hide righteous disdain for other civilizational zones, at the West’s peril. As Henry Kissinger suggested in a recent Wall Street Journal interview (paraphrased by the reporter), Americans “tend to view negotiations … in missionary rather than psychological terms, seeking to convert or condemn their interlocutors rather than to penetrate their thinking.”

Educational psychologist Jean Piaget wrote that appreciating others’ differing views is basic to healthy cognitive development. But the West at large today seems to do better in the rhetoric of diversity than at engaging with actual diverse perspectives.

The Melding of Church and State

Protestant states during the Reformation placed their churches under the control of state leaders as a precursor to the heyday of European imperialism. The melding of secular transcendent and corporate ideologies in modern globalization is viewed as neocolonialism in many countries still.

Peter the Great’s Westernizing reforms included using Protestant state models for church-state relations, which placed the Russian Orthodox Church’s organization administratively under the monarch. But the Orthodox ideal remained a Byzantine “symphonia” of church and state, a balance but not a merger of the two, in which an influential monastic presence played a key balancing role. This was symbolized by the double-headed eagle rather than the single-headed eagle of the American state.

Ironically given the Ukraine war, the “necessary war” doctrine seemed formed to deflect the kind of self-righteous crusades that bedeviled Western colonial and neocolonial powers. If no war is just, then all wars demand penitence.

All of this is not in any way to justify the war in Ukraine. In fact, as noted, “necessary war” doctrine on its own terms doesn’t seek to justify war in any sense of justice, given the cost to even one innocent human being, let alone the many being killed in Ukraine.

But from the Russian perspective of necessity, however much that can be disputed, this war seems perceived as just that: a “Hail Mary” pass against a neocolonial West messing with a historical heartland, militarily and culturally. The West sees its contravening intervention as a just war, today an extension of the role of social justice warriors at home, part of an ongoing campaign against a culturally repressive remnant of a different civilizational zone, which Mitt Romney famously termed our greatest geopolitical enemy (despite China).

Unlike Islamic civilization, Russia seems too familiar and too close to ignore. Unfortunately, that apparent familiarity bred a misunderstanding of civilizational differences. Meanwhile, the big practical problem that Kissinger has pointed out remains: This “other” is locked and loaded with nuclear weapons. Lord, have mercy!

Citizens Worldwide Have Had Enough Of Globalist Idiocy,"While you wouldn’t know it by following America’s legacy media, citizens across the globe are expressing widespread dissatisfaction with their respective government’s failed leadership. Whether it’s at the ballot box or in the streets, tens of thousands of people are openly rejecting the globalist ethos permeating governments worldwide that has resulted in higher costs of living, skyrocketing energy prices, and increasing difficulty among citizens addressing their families’ basic needs.

Spanning from Europe to South America, the backlash has been broad in both message and scope.

Indonesia

Thousands of Indonesians turned out en masse in some of the country’s biggest cities on Tuesday to demand that their “government reverse its first subsidised fuel price increase in eight years amid soaring inflation.”

According to Reuters, “[u]nder pressure to control a ballooning energy subsidy budget, President Joko Widodo on Saturday said he had little choice but to cut the subsidy and let fuel prices rise by about 30 percent,” with oil costs “32% higher than a year ago.”

“Protests took place in and around the capital, Jakarta, and in the cities of Surabaya, Makassar, Kendari, Aceh, and Yogyakarta, among a series of demonstrations led by students and labour groups that police say could draw big crowds this week,” the Reuters report reads. “Thousands of police were deployed across Jakarta, many guarding petrol stations, fearing they could become targets of mounting anger over a price increase that unions say will hurt workers and the urban poor the most.”

As noted by Bloomberg News, Indonesia “has one of the highest poverty rates in the world at 9.5%,” with the cost of necessary items like food set to become more expensive amid the country’s inflation increase.

“Workers are really, really suffering right now,” said Abdul Aris, a union official.

Italy

In Naples, Italians gathered in the streets outside the city’s town hall this past weekend to voice their displeasure with the nation’s rising energy costs. Protestors at the demonstration were filmed burning their energy bills in metallic bins while purportedly chanting phrases such as “We don’t pay the bills!” and “Now it will be chaos!”

“We don’t want [soaring bills] anymore!” protestors also shouted.

According to The London Economic, “Residents in the country will be asked to turn down the heating starting from October to help curb energy use, with limits on the use of central heating in public buildings also being brought in.”

Given that Italy is “heavily reliant on Russia for gas imports,” the European sanctions put on Moscow and Rome’s acceleration towards “green energy” are expected to leave Italians facing a rough winter ahead.

Chile

Voters in Chile over the past weekend overwhelmingly rejected a newly proposed, left-wing constitution that would have provided the government with vastly more power and control over the country’s citizenry.

According to The Blaze, the “170-page document containing 388 articles” would have “enshrine[d] 100 rights including the right to: a ‘nutritionally complete’ diet; ‘leisure’; ‘neurodiversity’; equality for ‘sexual and gender diversities and dissidences, both in the public and private spheres’; housing; sex parity in all public institutions; and to free education.”

With nearly two-thirds (61.9 percent) of Chileans opposing the measure, the vote represents a humiliating defeat for the country’s socialist president, Gabriel Boric, who supported the proposed constitution.

“I commit to put my all into building a new constitutional itinerary alongside congress and civil society,” Boric said.

Opponents of adopting the radical document celebrated voters’ decision, with Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for the Citizens’ House for Rejection, saying that “[t]oday we’re consolidating a great majority of Chileans who saw rejection as a path of hope.”

“We want to tell the government of President Gabriel Boric… that ‘today you must be the president of all Chileans and together we must move forward,” he said.

Czech Republic

In the Czech Republic, approximately 70,000 citizens showed up in the nation’s capital of Prague on Saturday to protest their government’s handling of the ongoing energy crisis and to express opposition to the European Union and NATO.

Organized by a wide swath of ideologically diverse political groups, “including the Communist Party of the Czech Republic and the Eurosceptic Tricolor Citizens’ Movement,” demonstrators “held Czech flags, as well as placards against the EU and NATO, Prime Minister Petr Fiala, rising energy prices, and calls for neutrality and dialogue with Russia.”

Protestors also demanded “the resignation of the current coalition government of conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala, whom they criticize for following pro-Western policies and allegedly paying more attention to war-torn Ukraine than to his citizens.”

“The purpose of our demonstration is to demand change, mainly in solving the issue of energy prices, especially electricity and gas, which will destroy our economy this fall,” event co-organizer Jiří Havel said.

The head of the Tricolor Party, Zuzana Majerová Zahradníková, echoed similar sentiments, saying that the “Czech Republic needs a Czech government” and that “[Prime Minister Petr] Fiala’s government may be Ukrainian, maybe Brussels, but not Czech.”

Event organizers are currently scheduling another protest for Sept. 28, according to The New Voice of Ukraine.

Why Hasn't McConnell Put America's Security Ahead Of Ukraine's?,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell thinks Democrats should stop splurging Americans’ tax dollars on policies that don’t help with problems such as the U.S.-Mexico border, but it is McConnell who needs to stop pretending he’s powerless to curb the southern border crisis while funneling billions to Ukraine.

“There is nothing compassionate about tolerating or even encouraging anarchy at the border, violence in our streets, and a steady erosion of public safety,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech titled “Americans’ Top Priorities Are Democrats’ Biggest Failures.” “It is neither fair nor compassionate, not to any Americans, least of all to the vulnerable people Democrats say they’re helping.”

McConnell is not ignorant about the unmitigated calamity that is the U.S.-Mexico border, nor is he unaware of how that is affecting the entire nation. He even mentioned in his speech that it’s President Joe Biden’s “failed border policies” that “have Customs and Border Protection encountering 200 percent more fentanyl and apprehending the most illegal immigrants they’ve seen in more than 20 years.”

As the GOP leader put it in his recent speech, “Americans may want their leaders to cut inflation, fight crime and drugs, and secure the border, but Democrats just spent hundreds of billions of dollars of the people’s money doing precisely none of that.”

You know who else is wasting billions of dollars of the people’s money on causes other than securing America’s borders? McConnell and his fellow swamp creatures who seem to have no qualms with sending endless funds, some of which are designated for U.S. weaponry that will likely end up on the Eastern European black market, to Ukraine. Over and over, McConnell has declined to take legislative action to put America first. Instead, he’s dead set on sticking it to former President Donald Trump and voting to squander Americans’ tax dollars on a foreign nation that is vulnerable to corruption and possible defeat.

The Federalist reached out to McConnell to ask why he hasn’t used his authority to put U.S. border security ahead of Ukraine’s, but the leader’s office directed The Federalist to a Fox News article detailing Republicans’ largely symbolic vote-a-rama amendments, including one that would have codified Title 42.

Unlike appropriations bills, these reconciliation amendments have no teeth and were quickly struck down by Democrats because, more than anything, they are just for show. But the ongoing border crisis and the more than 2 million illegal immigrants who have been caught crossing the border already this year require recourse far beyond the showy amendments found in reconciliation.

When The Federalist again asked if the GOP leader even invoked his authority to stonewall congressional security for other countries until the U.S. border was secure, the leader’s office did not immediately respond.

Yes, Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but McConnell is not completely powerless to make them pay for their sins. Look at how he used his weight to orchestrate the creation of a gun bill designed to shut up Democrats’ demands following the tragedy in Uvalde, Texas.

Despite his capability to enact meaningful policy, the GOP leader has so far shown a staunch unwillingness to make any substantial moves that would force Democrats to reconcile with the mess the president and his administration have created. It shouldn’t be hard for McConnell or his GOP leadership colleagues to propose an amendment that demands all eyes on the border before Republicans agree to pour billions into securing other borders overseas.

After all, amendments for emergency assistance for hurricane disaster recovery efforts, mental health, and other research were all proposed as additions to the expensive Ukraine bill.

McConnell could force Democrats’ hand on the border, but because his loyalty lies not to the voters and their interests but to the ways of the old GOP, he simply won’t. That’s problematic and just another example Republicans looking for reasons to replace McConnell could use in the near future.

Germany's Green Energy Follies Are A Warning To The U.S.,"Germany is reportedly working on reducing the nation’s economic dependency on Communist China due to concerns about “human rights abuses and the risks of being beholden to an increasingly assertive authoritarian state,” Reuters reports. Berlin finally learned one lesson from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: it’s dangerous to economically rely on authoritarian regimes.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s policies — building an economy based on Russia’s energy supply and China’s market demand — were primarily responsible for German’s economic predicament today. Zealous in fighting climate change, Merkel shut down coal mines and retired the majority of nuclear power plants in Germany while relying on Russia for energy and raw materials, despite repeated warnings from the Trump administration. By 2020, Russia supplied more than half of Germany’s natural gas and about a third of all the oil that Germans burned to heat homes, power factories, and fuel vehicles.

While paying Russia billions of euros for energy supply (the money no doubt helped finance Putin’s war chest), Merkel neglected to invest in German’s armed forces, even after Putin annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. She outsourced Germans’ and, to a larger extent, Europe’s security to the United States and simply hoped for the best. When Merkel retired in 2021, after being in office for 16 years, German’s military was left “in a weak position and require years of renewal to become a credible deterrent to Russian aggression,” according to The American Institute for Contemporary German Studies.

Strengthened China Ties

Besides empowering and enriching Russia, Merkel was keen on strengthening Germany’s economic ties with China while in office. No other leaders from Western democracies had visited China more often than Merkel (she had 11 state visits to China).

To promote Germany’s export-oriented economy, Merkel was indifferent to China’s aggression in the South China Sea, its geopolitical expansion through the “Belt and Road” infrastructure project, and its increasingly assertive foreign policies. In addition, she avoided criticizing China’s mishandling of Covid-19 in the early days of 2020 and turned a blind eye to many human rights abuses in China, especially the genocide of Uyghur Muslims and suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.

Under Merkel, China became Germany’s largest trading partner in 2016. German’s auto industry especially relies on China — about 50 percent of German car maker Volkswagen’s profit comes from China. Merkel’s China policy has made Germany’s economy vulnerable and helped speed up the Chinese military’s modernization.

Beijing reportedly focused on investments in Germany to obtain critical technologies, especially those with dual-use, meaning both civilian and military applications. For example, engines made by German companies have powered several types of Chinese navy warships, Deutsche Welle found.

Although Merkel retired in 2021, the effects of her economic policies continued. According to a German Economic Institute (IW) study, Germany’s economic dependency on China has continued to grow in 2022. “China’s share of German imports rose to 12.4 percent in the first half of 2022, compared with only 3.4 percent in 2000. German imports of Chinese goods… have surged by 45.7 percent year-on-year in the comparable period of the first six months. Germany’s trade deficit with the country had leapt to almost EUR 41 bn by mid-2022.”

A Wake-Up Call

After Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany joined other EU nations in imposing punitive economic sanctions on Russia. Putin retaliated by weaponizing his energy supply to Europe, sending energy prices soaring and dealing a blow to the German economy.

Inflation in Germany has reached a 40-year high. Suppose Putin shut off the natural gas supply to Europe, as he threatened. In that case, many predict an energy-induced recession in Europe is inevitable, and Germany could lose close to $240 billion in economic output over the next two years.

The grim economic outlook, and the fact that Beijing refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and helped Russia evade the West’s economic sanctions by purchasing Russian energy and agriculture products, have become a wake-up call for Germany. Additionally, Beijing’s “zero-Covid” policy that has kept dozens of cities and millions of Chinese people in lockdown means German businesses have had limited access to the Chinese market, and the trend will continue in the foreseeable future.

The German Economic Institute called for the government to change its economic policy, “specifically a reduction in incentives for doing business with China and a shift towards more trade with other emerging markets.” It also warned German businesses to “curb their dependency on China.” Otherwise, companies may expose themselves to bankruptcy due to Western sanctions imposed on China in the event of the People’s Liberation Army’s invading Taiwan.

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing also warned, “When it comes to dependencies, we also have to face the awkward question of how to deal with China.” He appealed to the German government to decouple economically from China and acknowledged such a move would “require a change no less fundamental than decoupling from Russian energy.”

Germany Stepping Back

These calls for action have reached their desired audience. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock acknowledged Germany couldn’t afford to “just behave following the motto ‘business first,’ without taking into account the long-term risks and dependencies.”

Reuters reports that Germany’s economic ministry is considering several actions to cut Germany’s reliance on China, including reducing or scrapping investment and export guarantees for China and no longer promoting trade fairs and manager training there. It is also contemplating screening not just Chinese investments in Germany but also German investments in China. It also might submit a complaint to the World Trade Organization about unfair Chinese trade practices, together with the Group of Seven, an intergovernmental political forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

While Germany is waking up to the risks of economic dependency on authoritarian regimes, the Biden administration has deepened our nation’s economic reliance on China with a green revolution that centers around replacing fossil fuels with solar and wind, and gas-powered cars with electric vehicles (EVs). China dominates the global supply chain of raw materials and parts for EV batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines. The nation has been able to keep the manufacturing cost low by burning coal and employing forced labor from Uyghur and other ethnic minorities.

Even Politico has had to admit the dirty truth: “The U.S path to clean energy goes straight through China.” Germany’s economic woes should serve as a timely warning to the Biden administration that relying on an authoritarian regime is both dangerous and foolish.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/14/germanys-green-energy-follies-are-a-warning-to-the-united-states/,2022-09-14
Biden Must Clarify US Commitments To Taiwan Before It Gets Ugly,"When asked point blank by “60 Minutes’s” Scott Pelley if the United States would come to Taiwan’s aid should China invade, President Joe Biden responded with a clear and firm answer.

Pelley: So unlike Ukraine, to be clear sir, U.S. forces, U.S. men and women, would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion? President Biden: Yes.

However, before the interview even made it to air, an unnamed White House official contradicted the president, saying that U.S. policy had not changed, meaning that the U.S. makes no official declaration of whether it would come to Taiwan’s aid if China decided to invade. This policy is known as strategic ambiguity.

Were this the first instance of Biden pledging to come to Taiwan’s aid only to be rebuked by his own White House, it might be making more headlines. Alas, this isn’t the first time Biden has made such a promise. In fact, this whole dance between Biden and his officials has become somewhat of a pattern.

In October 2021 and May 2022, Biden made similar remarks, only to be rebuked by the White House both times. The latter declaration was all the more awkward considering it was made by Biden at a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

When asked if the U.S. was prepared to defend Taiwan, standing next to Kishida, Biden answered, “Yes, that’s the commitment we made.” He continued:

We support the One China Policy, but that does not mean that China has the ability — excuse me — the jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan. So, we stand firmly with Japan and with other nations not to let that happen.

The first issue with this statement that should be noted is that Japan itself has no official policy on how it would act if China were to invade Taiwan. Though Japan has recently been more prone to expressing pro-Taiwan sentiment, there is no official alliance between Tokyo and Taipei.

The ‘One China Policy’ Fallacy

Aside from putting Kishida in an awkward position, Biden’s entire answer was drenched in contradiction.

To support the “One China Policy” means to maintain that Taiwan is nothing more than a part of China and that the rightful government resides in Beijing, not Taipei. So, if this is the case, why would China not have the right to use force to take over Taiwan?

Consider Hawaii. If officials in Honolulu decided to reject Washington and elect their own autonomous government, would the U.S. not have the authority to use force to solve the problem?

Of course, it’s not just Biden’s statement on the “One China Policy” that makes no sense. The policy itself is a Cold War-era relic that was never meant to make sense in the first place.

The “One China Policy” was enacted in 1979 when the Carter administration switched diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (ROC) government in Taipei to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing. The reasoning for the decision was both political and economic.

Politically, the Carter administration intended to form closer ties with Beijing to essentially encircle the Soviet Union and exert further pressure on the Kremlin. Given that 1979 was right in the middle of the Sino-Soviet split, Washington and Beijing shared the same fears when it came to the Soviet Union, so an official partnership made pragmatic sense.

Carter also wanted to expand opportunities for American business in China, given the massive market potential China represented. Furthermore, closer economic integration with Beijing, as policy modernization theory predicts, would eventually transform China into a capitalist liberal democracy.

The “One China Policy” served as a means to both of these ends. Washington would pretend Taiwan was part of China, without officially recognizing that Beijing has sovereignty over the island. Try as the experts might to make sense of this agreement, it just doesn’t. Washington and Beijing both knew that, but logical language wasn’t the priority at the time.

Fast forward 43 years, and both the preconditions for implementing the “One China Policy” no longer exist, at least to the extent that they necessitate the maintenance of such an incoherent and potentially destructive policy. Russia is no longer the geopolitical threat it once was, as evidenced by its amateur efforts in taking over Ukraine. And even if Russia was a juggernaut, it is as close to a staunch ally as China has, so that removes any notion that Washington might be able to use friendly relations with Beijing to influence the Kremlin.

As far as the economic portion of the equation, the U.S. is already actively seeking to decrease dependence on the Chinese market, and any pipe dream policymakers had that China would eventually moderate toward a liberal democracy have been firmly put to bed. Unless those same geniuses consider genocide, religious persecution, and locking millions of citizens in their own apartments to be moderate measures.

Whether or not switching diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the PRC in 1979 was a good idea is debatable. What’s not debatable is that preconditions for doing so in the first place no longer exist. This not only renders the “One China Policy” illogical but impractical, as well.

Understanding then, that the “One China Policy” is nothing more than outdated gobbledygook, a serious reconsideration of strategic ambiguity is in order.

Strategic Ambiguity Will Backfire

The main idea behind strategic ambiguity is that by remaining vague about what it would do if China were to invade, the U.S. could dissuade Taiwan from declaring independence, a red line for Beijing, while at the same time dissuading China from using force against Taiwan. The logic being neither side knows exactly how the U.S. will react, so the best course of action is to preserve the status quo.

In reality, given the current circumstances, this logic no longer holds. Xi Jinping has made it abundantly clear that he intends on achieving the “Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation” by 2049, the 100-year anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Paramount in doing so is “resolving the Taiwan question.” In order to accomplish this feat, he has not ruled out using force if necessary.

Further evidence suggests that China’s window for taking Taiwan is narrowing. First of all, Xi Jinping is 69 years old, so if he intends to make good on his promise, he has an increasingly limited amount of time to make it happen.

Socio-economic considerations in China, including a rapidly aging population and slowing economic growth, also indicate China may reach the pinnacle of its national power sooner rather than later, meaning that the cost-benefit analysis necessary for achieving a large-scale invasion will also become increasingly grim.

And if Tsai Ing-wen’s government’s policy and Taiwanese national attitudes are any indication, if China plans to “re-unify” Taiwan, force will be the only option. After all, according to the latest survey data, only 6.4 percent of Taiwanese want to unify with China now or in the future, so the likelihood of any peaceful solution is fairy dust.

Maintaining a policy of strategic ambiguity isn’t fooling China, either. At this point, China is going to do what it wants based on its own domestic political calculations and the ambitions of its leader. The only thing that strategic ambiguity does is leave Taipei in limbo and our military underprepared.

Stop with the Word Games

Instead of playing word games where the president makes a declaration and the White House walks it back, the State Department should form a coherent policy. One that scraps strategic ambiguity altogether. This would allow the U.S. to take concrete steps to ensure the security of the Taiwan Strait. These would include formal military training exercises with the Taiwanese military, similar to those the U.S. conducts with South Korea, as well as potentially opening an embassy and stationing troops on the island.

Right now, in the wake of events in Afghanistan and Ukraine, U.S. credibility amongst its allies is seriously in question. By resolving to defend Taiwan, the U.S. could regain some of that credibility and convince other countries to join an anti-hegemonic coalition against China.

Moving away from strategic ambiguity toward concrete support of Taiwan would empower other regional players, namely Japan, to make similar declarations. If the U.S. and Japan are both firmly committed to coming to Taiwan’s aid, Beijing would have to deeply reconsider if invading the island would even be feasible, let alone worth the damage it would incur.

If the State Department wants to continue to perpetuate the myth of “One China” to allow Beijing to save face, fine. However, it should be abundantly clear how the U.S. will respond if China decides to push its luck and invade Taiwan.

Trashing strategic ambiguity would make war less, not more, likely. It would also save members of the White House comms team a lot of unnecessary effort presently dedicated to running interference on their own president.

'Doomsday Clock' Unchanged Under Biden Despite Nuclear Threat,"This week proved that the gravest threat to the human race is still the human race. We appear to be marching closer to doomsday — even if scientists won’t say it yet.

On Tuesday, Politico reported that the U.S. and allied intelligence agencies will beef up surveillance of the Kremlin’s nuclear arsenal in response to another round of what have now become routine threats from President Vladimir Putin. As he announced his country’s first war mobilization since World War II with the calling up of 300,000 reservists, Putin made clear that the country’s use of nuclear weapons was a real possibility.

“If Russia feels its territorial integrity is threatened, we will use all defense methods at our disposal, and this is not a bluff,” Putin said, days before the Kremlin sponsored sham elections in Ukrainian territory to pave the way for Russian annexation.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan repeated across three Sunday morning television shows that the U.S. would respond to any use of nuclear weapons with “catastrophic consequences” for the Kremlin.

Without him spelling out the details of the deliberately ambiguous phrase, a U.S. response could range from tougher economic sanctions to tit-for-tat nuclear retaliation, the latter of which risks escalation to a nuclear Armageddon.

Upon completion of the staged referendums in four Ukrainian territories, Putin’s predecessor, who is now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, issued yet another warning that nuclear weapons might be deployed. Putin’s threats, Medvedev wrote in a Tuesday Telegram post, are “certainly not a bluff.”

“I believe that NATO will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation,” Medvedev said. “Overseas and European demagogues are not going to perish in a nuclear apocalypse. Therefore, they will swallow the use of any weapon in the current conflict.”

Despite the heightened rhetoric from a frustrated Moscow now engaged in a months-long war, the infamous “Doomsday Clock” remains unchanged from January 2020 at 100 seconds to midnight. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which sets the made-up clock, refused to inch the hands closer to global catastrophe in March after the major war broke out between Russia and Ukraine. Putin even began the invasion with a warning that other nations who intervene will “face consequences that you have never seen.”

Six months later, a spokesman for the Bulletin told The Federalist that no changes would be made until the group’s scientists meet in November and discuss what time it will be in January.

“As the war continues, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists continues to monitor developments in Ukraine and will take them into account for future Doomsday Clock announcements,” said John Pope, the group’s chief audience officer.

The artificial clock was created after World War II and has remained a fixation among journalists to cheer Democratic policy outcomes while fearmongering over Republicans. For example, The Washington Post ran the headline, “The Doomsday Clock just advanced, ‘thanks to Trump'” just six days after President Donald Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

Meanwhile, amid the back-and-forth saber-rattling between the world’s largest two nuclear powers (with a combined inventory of 11,405 warheads), NASA successfully smashed a spacecraft into an asteroid for the purpose of saving the world in the distant future.

On Monday, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission crashed a high-speed projectile into a small space rock 7 million miles away. The objective of the mission is to determine the capability of redirecting an asteroid if it were hurling toward Earth. While the final results of the mission likely won’t be conclusive for weeks, the spacecraft’s successful collision marks a turning point in human history, which is now equipped to save the planet from extraterrestrial threats.

“For the first time, humanity has demonstrated the ability to autonomously target and alter the orbit of a celestial object,” celebrated Ralph Semmel, the director of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, after the crash.

It’s ironic that the same week NASA conducted what appears to be so far a successful mission related to saving the planet, the specter of nuclear apocalypse has reached a new realm of possibility. On the other hand, one has to wonder how long the human race could realistically co-exist with more than 13,000 nuclear warheads in the first place.

The first nuclear bomb was detonated in July 1945 on a vast expanse of New Mexican desert. Within a month, the only two bombs ever deployed on the battlefield were dropped in Japan to end the Second World War. The explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki not only forced the Japanese into capitulation, but they also introduced a new era of unprecedented destruction looming over the globe. An eerie story about Albert Einstein spells out the predicament:

Professor Albert Einstein was asked by friends at a recent dinner party what new weapons might be employed in World War III. Appalled at the implications, he shook his head. After several minutes of meditation, he said. “I don’t know what weapons might be used in World War III. But there isn’t any doubt what weapons will be used in World War IV.” “And what are those?” a guest asked. “Stone spears,” said Einstein.

While the proliferation of nuclear weapons since 1945 has served as a deterrent to global conflict by raising the costs of a third world war to nothing short of self-extermination, it would also seem a miracle to last 100 years without another detonation.

Over the course of human history, there has been no shortage of conflict. The first two world wars happened within only 21 years of each other. Can we really go five times that without another global conflict breaking out? While the consequences of a nuclear war are certain, the avoidance of one will always be far from it. We can stop an asteroid, but not incompetent leaders.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/29/doomsday-clock-hasnt-changed-under-biden-despite-escalating-nuclear-threat/,2022-09-29
It's Not Crazy To Think Biden Sabotaged The Nord Stream Pipeline,"The sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines earlier this week will likely mark a turning point in the Russo-Ukrainian war — although which way the war will turn remains, like responsibility for the sabotage itself, unknown.

On Thursday, Russia’s foreign ministry denied Moscow had anything to do with the attacks, saying it “looks like an act of terrorism, possibly on a state level,” and suggested that, with the pipelines out of commission, the United States could stand to benefit by increasing sales of liquefied natural gas to Europe.

For its part, NATO on Thursday formally declared the partial demolition of the pipelines an act of deliberate sabotage and said it would be met with a collective response. The European Union said the same a day earlier. The Biden administration dismissed Russian suggestions that the United States was responsible and said only that it would support its European allies as they conducted an investigation into the “apparent sabotage” of the pipelines.

This is ominous not just because it comes amid rising tensions between Russia and Europe as the war drags on but because of how it increases the uncertainty around what happens next. If the pipelines were attacked to send a message, no one knows what the message is. If it was to arrange the next phase of events, no one knows what that phase might be or how to prepare for it.

What we do know is that after more than seven months of fighting, the war is not going well for Moscow. Ukrainian forces, supplied and actively supported by the United States to the tune of $67 billion in aid and weapons, appear to be recapturing some parts of the country that until recently had been under Russian control. In response, Russia is now set to annex swaths of Ukraine it still controls, has undertaken a partial mobilization of some 300,000 of its reservists in the first mass mobilization since World War II, and Russian President Vladimir Putin recently warned he is willing to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia against the West.

So, things are escalating. As I predicted back in April, U.S. sponsorship of Ukraine has, over the course of the summer and into the fall, amounted to escalation, which is always what the Biden administration’s stated maximalist policy vis-à-vis Moscow required. To accomplish the total defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine and, ultimately, regime change in the Kremlin, the U.S. will almost certainly have to deepen its involvement in the war beyond supplying the Ukrainians with cash and weapons and battlefield intel. That is, we will have to get directly involved, and there is ample indication that plenty of unreconstructed neocons in Washington are trying to make that happen, one way or another.

The question of what happens now, therefore, has much to do with who blew up the pipelines. The sabotage was clearly an act of escalation. So who is doing the escalating? My friend Joshua Treviño has a lengthy and excellent analysis of the strategic situation on his Substack, Armas, that deserves a close reading. He assumes that Russia attacked the pipelines and that we should understand this as an effort by the Putin regime to radically expand the problem set it is facing. The purpose of expanding the problem set, he explains, is “to restore a conceptual arena for action for itself, in pushing outward a horizon of uncertainty which has been reduced to a tremendous degree by Ukrainian battlefield dynamism and the restiveness of the Russian general public.”

That is, the demolition of the pipelines is designed to provoke conventional conflict with Ukraine’s western sponsors. Why would Russia want to do that? Because, Treviño argues:

[T]he destruction of essentially unused European energy infrastructure avoids casus bellum, while sending a strong signal to the Western alliance’s weak link in Berlin. The signal is this: Germany will freeze this winter, and there is no going back. One must admire the audacity of it. Russian frogmen conducting a pipeline demolition on the Baltic-sea floor may take its place as metaphor alongside Cortez burning his ships.

He goes on to make an unsettling case that the war is going so badly for Putin that he is willing to risk drawing the U.S. into it by detonating a nuke and gambling that the Biden administration will not respond in kind but instead launch a conventional response and enter the war alongside Ukraine — a scenario in which Russian forces would be driven from Ukraine (that is, Russia loses the war) but the Putin regime survives. As I said, it is worth reading in full, given the stakes.

But without getting into the nuclear scenario, it is worth backing up to consider the possible motives at play in attacking the pipelines in the first place, and why that would happen now, at the end of September.

It seems to me unlikely that Russia blew them up for the simple reason that doing so removed Moscow’s one non-nuclear strategic lever over western Europe. If the point was to communicate, “Germany will freeze this winter,” why not just shut off the pipeline and let the world know that Russia had done it?

Far more likely, I think, is that U.S. special forces did it on orders from the White House. Tucker Carlson floated this idea on Fox News earlier this week and was roundly mocked for it by the likes of The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake, among others. But the theory cannot be so easily dismissed — not least because, as Carlson and others noted after the sabotage, Biden himself said back in February that if Russia invaded Ukraine, there would no longer be a Nord Stream 2, that “we will bring an end to it.”

President Joe Biden said that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine and stressed unity with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as the West rallies to avert a war in Europe https://t.co/Qyp7NJEEQS pic.twitter.com/TkhrmNm0yy — Reuters (@Reuters) February 8, 2022

To understand why the Biden administration would take such a drastic step, we need to understand something that has been true about the Democrats for nearly two decades, and certainly since the administration of Barack Obama: They tend to view all U.S. foreign policy as primarily an instrument of domestic politics. From their opportunistic opposition to the Iraq war going into the 2006 midterms, to Obama’s policies on Iran and the Arab Spring and especially Russia, Democrats have come to calibrate their responses to events abroad through a domestic partisan lens.

Put another way, American foreign policy is for them a means to an end that has mostly to do with gaining and retaining power in Washington. Think of the now infamous “Russia Reset,” when in March 2009 then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a giant red plastic “reset” push-button, a symbol — albeit a botched one, the button was mislabeled with the Russian word for “overcharged” — meant above all to be a repudiation of President George W. Bush’s Russia policy, which called for missile defense installations in eastern Europe that Obama promptly canceled in the name of the “reset.” For Obama, who ran for and won office as an anti-Iraq war candidate, Russia policy was less about U.S. or European security and all about showcasing to his domestic supporters just how unlike his predecessor he was.

The Russo-Ukrainian war is no different. Facing a historic midterm wipeout and the loss of Congress, it isn’t hard to see why, with November barreling down on us, the Biden administration would choose this moment to escalate in a way that draws NATO into the war. The point is to rescue the president’s failing administration. Biden, in this scenario, becomes a war president. How much easier and more plausible it would be to then blame the tanking economy and rising prices on Putin and Russia? Easier, too, to denounce Republicans who oppose U.S. involvement as traitors to democracy — something Democrats already do with far less provocation.

One might object that although Biden and the Democrats are clearly stupid, surely they are not as malevolent as all that. On the contrary, I find it rather easy to believe that Biden possesses the kind of malevolence and resolve required to sabotage Nord Stream 1 and 2 for reasons that have mostly to do with domestic politics. After all, it takes boldness, innovation, and naked aggression to weaponize the Justice Department and FBI in the ways that we have seen over the past two years. The Democrats barreled ahead with it, even though it risks tearing the country apart.

Why? Because they see criminalizing their political opposition as one of the only paths to retaining power, and are willing to hazard everything to achieve that. If they are willing to weaponize domestic law enforcement for political gain at home, it is not too much to suppose they would pursue a policy of escalation with Russia to cling to power, which in the end is the one thing they really care about.

"As Russia Threatens Nukes, The US Has Limited Options","The number of annual fatalities from war has dropped precipitously since the end of World War II, despite the number of actual conflicts having increased significantly. That unprecedented development has been correctly linked to the formidable deterrent power of the nuclear forces of the United States and its allies France and the United Kingdom, a deterrent that may now be diminishing just when the U.S. has achieved a political consensus to begin a new round of necessary nuclear modernization.

Since World War II, U.S. nuclear and conventional weapons have successfully deterred direct war between great powers, but the current strategic balance is now coming under great stress.

One key strategic guardrail was the U.S. goal of exceeding the power of our adversaries, especially with nuclear deterrence. But as retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Garret Harencak warned more than a decade ago, the post-Cold War, decades-long failure by the U.S. to modernize, what he described as embarking on a “holiday from history” has real-world consequences.

One worrisome development was former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev concluding last week that if Russia used nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the U.S. would be too scared to respond.

How did this come about?

Four Key Developments

During our “holiday from history,” four things happened.

First, there has been what Adm. Charles Richard described as a “breathtaking” Chinese nuclear build-up, during which U.S. policymakers insisted China’s rise was “peaceful.”

Second, Russia decreed in 1999 that it would build more useable, accurate, discriminate, and shorter-range nuclear weapons in pursuit of a strategy to threaten to escalate from a conventional conflict to the nuclear level. This “escalate to win strategy” aims to keep the U.S. out of the fight altogether, a strategy that appears to be bearing fruit.

Third, while U.S. strategic nuclear modernization is now robustly underway, our shorter range and smaller theater nuclear capability had previously been jettisoned and withered, and still remains vastly inferior to that of Russia and even China.

And fourth, Russia invaded Ukraine in both 2014 and 2022, for which we should have been but were not prepared, especially given the U.S. and United Kingdom both pledged to support Ukraine as far back as 1994.

Such U.S. mistakes have led to a number of further nuclear developments that are flashing red on the warning screens of our military commanders.

Russia’s Strategy

As the U.S. has witnessed, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by an unprecedented number of explicit threats by Moscow to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. and its allies, and apparently, those have successfully deterred the U.S. from directly intervening militarily.

Although U.S. nuclear modernization is thankfully moving quickly forward, the actual deployments remain at least a half-decade away, while new theater forces such as submarine-launched cruise missiles will be ready only later in the next decade.

Adding further complications to the strategic environment, the combined Chinese and Russian nuclear buildup calls into question the viability of the 2010 New START II arms agreement and the 1550 warhead limit under which the U.S. must operate. For the first time in more than four decades, the U.S. has to seriously contemplate whether to “build back-up” beyond the New Start ceilings.

Our Options

What then is the United States to do? Our options aren’t great but here they are.

Our New START treaty force structure restricts the U.S. “hedge.” We can add roughly an additional 1,500 sea- and land-based missile warheads to our arsenal, or double what we have now, but it would take four years to accomplish. Such a force might not even match the new Chinese warheads based in 360 silos.

As for building more accurate or lower yield nuclear warheads for theater systems, an explicit presidential finding is required that such a weapon is needed, an admittedly controversial decision that probably would be characterized by opponents as supporting a nuclear “warfighting” (bad) and not “deterrence” goal (good), the former being characterized by using nuclear weapons to actually fight a war while the latter is only a threat to retaliate.

Much U.S. conventional and nuclear modernization will take place in the next decade. In the meantime, our enemies are not going to graciously wait around for us to get our act together. U.S. conventional weapons are having a positive effect in reducing Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine — for now. But every assumed U.S. conventional military success turns to failure should Russian President Vladimir Putin use nuclear weapons against Ukraine and its allies. U.S. wargames and table-top exercises have confirmed the U.S. would under the current military balance fail to achieve a favorable outcome if nuclear weapons were introduced into the conflict by Russia.

Many Unknowns

To summarize, the current geostrategic landscape does not favor the United States. Due to our force structure, we lack arms control leverage to get Russia to agree to a good deal such as limiting or banning multiple warheads, a proposal Russia has previously rejected.

If a conflict goes nuclear with the first use of highly accurate, low-yield Russian weapons, the U.S. and its allies have limited options with which to respond, as our Europe-based gravity bombs and platforms from which they are launched have to fly through enemy territory and avoid air defenses. Whether cyber and advanced conventional capabilities can fill that gap is not fully known.

We also have no guarantee any military conflict will remain at the conventional level, where the U.S. has at least a good chance of stopping Russian aggression.

For now, the U.S. and its allies are primarily trying to decide whether Putin’s nuclear threats are largely bluff, and we are stuck not knowing whether our warnings to avoid nuclear escalation are taken seriously.

Why Ukraine In NATO Could Be A Nuclear Nightmare For America,"In Washington, D.C., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the equivalent of a foreign policy holy sacrament. To listen to many policymakers and foreign policy commentators, you would think NATO is as essential to America as our Constitution, apple pie, or baseball.

Questioning its continued utility in the post-Cold War era — or its further expansion — elicits accusations of being everything from un-American to a Putin stooge. This has made it almost impossible to have a substantive discussion about a military alliance designed to deter the threat of the Soviet Union — a country that hasn’t existed for more than 30 years.

Look no further than the fact that only one senator, Josh Hawley, voted against the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO in June. Hawley rightly questioned whether it was wise to extend America’s security umbrella to two wealthy European welfare states that have been safe and secure as neutral nations for more than 70 years, especially considering other pressing challenges at home and abroad. The bipartisan vitriol hurled at Hawley for his reasonable stance showed that Washington is far from ready to discuss the future of the NATO alliance like adults.

This wasn’t always the case. The United States was a nation founded on a suspicion of permanent alliances, especially with Europe. George Washington in his farewell address advised “to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world…” and specifically against “interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe.” This approach to alliances guided American foreign policy for most of our history and kept us out of the chaos of 19th-century Europe.

There is good reason for our leaders to revisit the wise words of our first president. Just last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded an accelerated accession to NATO, claiming that Ukraine is already a de facto member of the alliance. Due to the collective defense obligations of NATO members spelled out in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, this could mean committing America’s sons and daughters to fight in an ongoing war with a nuclear-armed Russia.

In a diplomatic cable dispatched in 2008, then-U.S. ambassador and current CIA Director William Burns wrote, “NATO enlargement, particularly to Ukraine, remains an ‘emotional and neuralgic’ issue for Russia.” For the United States, however, there are simply no vital American interests at stake that warrant a nuclear showdown with Moscow.

Allowing Ukraine to join NATO — and thereby committing America’s full military arsenal to the negligible matter of who governs the Donbas — would significantly raise the possibility of nuclear devastation. It is therefore essential that American policymakers firmly reject Ukraine’s demands to join NATO while slamming shut the “open door” policy offered at the 2008 Bucharest Summit.

Even absent the current conflict, NATO membership for Ukraine would be costly to Americans. According to a report published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies prior to the launch of the current Russian invasion, the upfront costs would be up to $27 billion with annual costs totaling up to $11 billion for American taxpayers if Ukraine joins NATO. The United States military would also be required to permanently deploy tens of thousands more troops to Europe, which would further strain a military that is already over-tasked around the world and facing significant challenges with recruiting.

A further expansion of NATO and increased deployment of U.S. troops to Europe would also encourage more European free-riding. Already, rich European states that should have more of a stake in what happens in Eastern Europe are contributing significantly less than the United States to the defense of Ukraine.

Worse, promised defense spending increases by countries such as Germany may not materialize. And why would they? The United States has doubled down in Europe, spending tens of billions of dollars and deploying more troops to Eastern Europe to support Ukraine and reassure nervous allies. None of this has been fixed to greater defense spending by our NATO allies. The Europeans have no incentive to stop treating Uncle Sam like Uncle Sucker.

For these reasons, it should be a no-brainer for America’s leaders to permanently slam the door on the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. But for many, blind loyalty to NATO trumps common sense.

Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., told Politico he supports Ukraine’s rapid accession to NATO, despite the ongoing war. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, while not specifically endorsing NATO membership for Ukraine, did say she supports a “security guarantee” for the country, which could be granted through NATO. Even the Biden administration, while not endorsing rapid accession to NATO, did keep the door open for their membership at a later date.

American leaders should put the interests of the American people first — and certainly before those of an alliance that long ago outlived its original purpose. Putting Ukraine under America’s security umbrella through NATO would lead to disastrous results. Beyond the risk of a nuclear conflict, spending tens of billions of dollars to expand NATO to Ukraine or other European countries is foolish during a time of record inflation, a $30 trillion national debt, and the rising threat of China in Asia.

The American people are owed a much more serious evaluation of NATO and its continued utility than the emotional nostalgia that dominates the discourse in policymaking circles.

"Elon Musk Is Right, The Russia-Ukraine War Needs To End","As if to burnish his reputation as a super-villain in the eyes of the corporate press, Elon Musk this week floated an idea on Twitter for a possible resolution of the Russo-Ukrainian war. For his trouble, he was swiftly accused of being a pro-Putin stooge by guardians of the Official Narrative. His suggested peace plan was dismissed out of hand as “Russia-friendly” and, as The Washington Post’s Olivier Knox put it, “designed to lock in Russian territorial gains.”

But Musk’s idea shouldn’t be so quickly dismissed, not least because it has the virtue of being grounded in reality, but also because broadly speaking the billionaire mogul is right: It’s time for the war in Ukraine to come to an end. One need not be “Russia-friendly” to recognize that this war will most likely end in one of two ways. Either there will be a negotiated political settlement, in which both Russia and Ukraine get some of what they vitally need, or the thing will escalate into a worldwide nuclear war.

Given the options, the responsible thing to do is think through how a settlement might be reached — something our political leaders and media elites, wedded as they are to a maximalist Ukraine policy that seeks the total defeat of Russian forces and regime change in Moscow, have thus far been incapable of doing.

Musk proposed a four-part deal: Re-do the elections in the recently annexed areas of eastern Ukraine, this time under United Nations supervision; leave Crimea as part of Russia; assure a water supply to Crimea; Ukraine agrees to remain neutral.

Ukraine-Russia Peace:



– Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.



– Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).



– Water supply to Crimea assured.



– Ukraine remains neutral. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 3, 2022

The plan isn’t perfect, obviously, but it’s a far cry from Kremlin propaganda. It recognizes something that sharp observers of the conflict could see even before Russia’s invasion in late February: With its current borders, Ukraine can have territorial integrity or political independence, but it can’t have both.

My friend Mario Loyola made precisely that argument in these pages weeks before the war began, noting that Ukraine’s present-day borders date from 1954, when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev “gave” Ukraine nominal control over strategic swaths of territory that had not been traditionally considered part of Ukraine, such as the Crimean Peninsula, along with a formidable Soviet nuclear arsenal. The point was to make it seem like the Warsaw Pact was something other than a Soviet concoction designed to give Moscow more seats in the U.N. General Assembly.

But those borders were never meant to be “real.” When the Soviet Union collapsed decades later, the United States recognized the situation was untenable and helped arrange for the return of Ukraine’s nuclear arsenal to Moscow and broker an agreement for Russia to retain access to its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. But even these adjustments didn’t create a stable situation, as Loyola writes:

A glance at the map of 1991 should have made people wonder whether Ukraine, in these artificially enlarged borders, could even be a viable state. It wasn’t at all clear that Ukraine would be strong enough to maintain both political independence and territorial integrity given the weight of vital Russian interests involved.“Russia is never as strong as she looks, Russia is never as weak as she looks,” the saying goes, and the map of 1991 reflected a state of Russian weakness that was bound to prove fleeting. Ukraine had no problem controlling the territory as long as it accepted Moscow’s control. But the moment it definitively broke away from Moscow in 2014, it immediately lost control of those areas that were most vital to Russian interests, and nobody with an even minimal sense of Russian and Ukrainian history can pretend to have been taken by surprise.

All of that to say, freezing Ukraine’s 1991 border in place all but guaranteed a future conflict, which is now upon us. The Biden administration could have responded by insisting that Ukraine and Russia work out a negotiated settlement that addressed the territorial problems everyone knew had been festering for decades. Instead, Biden opted to throw our lot in with Ukraine to the tune of $67 billion and counting, making Ukraine a de facto member of NATO and guaranteeing that the war can grind on indefinitely — or escalate into a wider, possibly nuclear war.

Certainly, absent U.S. funding and support, Ukraine would have long ago negotiated a political settlement that involved some adjustment of its borders or some assurances of its neutrality. Indeed, negotiations early on in the war, back in March, brokered by Israel and Turkey were predicated on just such an exchange: In return for guarantees of Ukrainian neutrality (meaning Ukraine would never join NATO), Russian forces would withdraw from Ukraine. Those talks broke down in early April around the time then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Now, more than seven months into the fighting, the Biden administration seems intent on closing down any possible remaining off-ramps that could bring about an end to the war. We can’t know for certain that the U.S. was behind the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines (although it makes more sense than assuming Russia did it), but the attack is just the sort of thing that risks widening the war beyond Ukraine and rendering a bilateral negotiated settlement impossible.

Is it possible Biden doesn’t want this war to end in a compromise between Moscow and Kyiv? Is the view expressed back in March by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that the war will continue until Russian forces are driven from a totally intact and politically independent Ukraine, the end state that the White House is working toward? If so, it would suggest that a negotiated peace isn’t really what the Biden administration wants out of this, but rather something more like regime change in Moscow, which is exactly what Blinken’s scenario would portend.

If that’s the goal, then something along the lines of Musk’s peace plan is exactly what you wouldn’t want. It’s the sort of thing you’d want to denigrate as Kremlin propaganda or the rantings of a deranged billionaire. You certainly wouldn’t want anyone to take it seriously, because then ordinary people might get the idea that there’s a way out of this war that doesn’t involve escalation and that prevents the U.S. from getting drawn in deeper than we already are.

But if your goal was for something other than regime change in Moscow, say, for an end to the fighting and a settlement that both Ukraine and Russia could live with, then you’d want to start thinking about what such a settlement might entail. And it might end up looking a lot like what Musk threw out there, to the immediate consternation and fury of the corporate press. Imagine that.

Who In This Administration Is Putting America First?,"A former deputy assistant secretary of defense recently asked the million-dollar question of the moment: “Is Ukraine worth fighting a nuclear war over? If not, we should act accordingly.” If you answer that question by putting America’s interests first, the answer is obviously “no.”

If this is the case, that Ukraine is not worth fighting a nuclear war over, how then should the U.S. “act accordingly”? Reasonable responses could vary. But whatever a smart course of action might be, that’s not what we have witnessed over the last 10 days from the Biden administration and the pro-war crowd.

The most recent round of nuclear saber-rattling started around Sept. 21, when Russian President Vladimir Putin warned, “In the face of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal.” He repeated a similar warning on Friday, Sept. 30, as Russia celebrated the annexation of four more regions of western Ukraine (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia), talking about the “precedent” set by the U.S. using nuclear weapons in World War II.

When approaching this topic, some caveats and principled statements are necessary: 1) The Russian invasion of Ukraine should be condemned; 2) Putin should be taken seriously; and 3) The use of any kind of nuclear weapons, tactical or otherwise, in Ukraine, or in defense of the annexed regions, would be a massive escalation.

Risking Nuclear War

American interests demand we act accordingly to avoid a nuclear confrontation with Russia. But in response to the ratcheted-up rhetoric from the Russians, it appears we have lost our collective minds. Has it been decreed by the powers that be that it’s worth risking a nuclear holocaust over the Donbas? It seems so.

A week ago Sunday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told “Face the Nation” that “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the U.S. and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.”

Sullivan doubled down on this line just this past Friday during a White House press briefing. When asked, “Would the U.S. actively enter the war if Putin used nukes on Ukraine?,” he didn’t say “no.” He didn’t say, “That would be up to Congress since they have the constitutional authority to declare war.” No, he repeated that “we have had the opportunity to communicate directly to Russia a range of consequences for the use of nuclear weapons and the kinds of actions the United States would take.”

Given that such an attack wouldn’t be on the U.S. or NATO, just what consequences is the Biden administration at liberty to dispense without a formal declaration of war from Congress?

This constitutional question didn’t seem to trouble a former CIA director, Gen. David Petraeus, on ABC this week, either. In response to the “nuclear question,” he told “This Week” co-anchor Jonathan Karl, “Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a NATO, a collective effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.” Karl rightly noted that this “would bring America and NATO into the war.”

Yes, it would. Into the war. Just like that. Congress and Constitution be damned.

Who’s Putting Americans First?

In light of all of this brinkmanship, I have to ask (because it seems like no one else is): Who is putting our American interests first? Who in the cadre of the “adults” that are “back in charge” is leading in such a way as to avoid dragging the U.S. into a direct (and possibly nuclear) armed confrontation with Russia over foreign soil?

It’s been little more than one year since Biden’s disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, a lingering reminder that we have precious little to show for our last 20-plus years of foreign adventurism and failed exercises in nation-building. “Sacred” democracy isn’t an export every country wants to take at the end of a gun. Far too many American lives were lost in the Middle East, and far too many freedoms at home, during the war on terrorism. So I think I speak on behalf of most of my fellow Americans when I say not a single drop of American blood should be spilled on Ukrainian soil.

And while the military-industrial complex might be thrilled at the prospects of a hot war in Ukraine, as they ride the irresponsible riverboat of billions of dollars in aid, American citizens are rightly wondering how any of this spending, any of this rhetoric, and any of this warmongering helps them put cheaper food on their tables and gas in their tanks.

Ukraine is not a NATO ally; for that, we should be eternally grateful. Yet even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stages his made-for-TV NATO application signing, we must be frank: Ukraine has no business being in NATO. This very conversation about the possible use of nuclear weapons and an “American response” underscores that reality.

Let’s ask: What if Russia were to use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine? To be clear, that would be a disastrous and deadly escalation in an already ill-fated war. Yet even if Russia did, what possible benefit could there be for the U.S., and for American citizens, by responding in kind? None whatsoever. The same goes for an overwhelming or “catastrophic” conventional response. Why are our leaders so confident Putin would be willing to suffer a serious strike and then back down? The hubris beggars belief.

One of the things I admired most about former President Donald Trump while serving at the State Department and the Pentagon during his administration was his restraint. Whether it was in our pursuit of real diplomacy with the belligerent nuclear power of North Korea or refusing to escalate in response to Iran shooting down one of our surveillance drones, President Trump displayed strength through restraint. Power through prudence. And now is a time for restraint.

Now, I can already hear the neocon accusations of this posture being “pro-Putin” getting drafted over at The Dispatch. To which I say: Let The Dispatch and the D.C. Beltway boo. If the Beltway is booing, the heartland is cheering. I’m sure most New Yorkers would be cheering along with the heartland, too, if it means they won’t be witnessing a mushroom cloud rising over Manhattan anytime soon.

No Trusting This Administration

Some may argue that this kind of bluster is what’s necessary to ensure real nuclear deterrence. James Traub, at Foreign Policy, records that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles once “boasted of his gifts at nuclear blackmail,” saying “some say that we were brought to the verge of war. Of course we were brought to the verge of war. The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art.”

Such diplomacy may be an art — one that requires real skill. But allow me to indulge one half of another hypothetical here: Even if it were worth it for America to counter a nuclear strike in Ukraine, does anyone seriously think this administration is the one we can trust to pull it off? Discretion is the better part of valor. Doubly so when incompetence defines your operations. There is no John Foster Dulles, or even a near equivalent, serving in our national security apparatus.

The truth that few seem willing to state clearly is this: Nuclear brinksmanship over Ukraine puts America last. Ukraine is Europe’s problem, not ours. And are we the only nation with nuclear weapons that might defend Ukraine? What about the United Kingdom? Or France?

When it comes to our domestic priorities, the only party who stands to gain from America either fully entering the war in Ukraine, or returning nuclear fire on Russia, is China. There is no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party is cheering on this development with as much eager anticipation as the forever-war uniparty here at home.

Still, there’s no need to let the beating of nuclear war drums march us into an unwinnable disaster that may yield radioactive consequences on our own soil. President Joe Biden says there’s not “one inch” of NATO territory we won’t defend. Fine. But Ukraine is not in NATO. Thus, there’s not an inch of Ukrainian soil that’s worth risking a nuclear strike on our home soil over. Not one.

Admitting this isn’t weakness; it’s reason and restraint. It’s putting America’s interests and American lives (possibly millions of them) first. The Biden administration and the blood hawks screeching from the defense contractor-funded think tanks might not care to do so, but I do. I learned at least that much from my time serving President Trump.

Wherever the cooler heads are in the Biden camp, let’s hope and pray they prevail. There’s no doubt that a midterm election October surprise is most likely coming. There’s no need — at all — for it to be a nuclear one.

Congress's Duty To U.S. Must Trump Its Infatuation With War,"Earlier this year, as the Senate approved Finland and Sweden joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., offered a straightforward amendment to clarify in law that “Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty does not supersede the constitutional requirement that Congress declare war before the United States engages in war.” The Senate rejected the measure 87-10. In arguing against the need for clarity, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said, “Now, it’s well and good for Congress to consider war powers and a role in military conflicts, but doing so … while Ukraine is under attack and while Russia may be potentially eyeing violence against NATO nations is not the time.”

But now is the time to reconsider how the alliance was originally understood when the U.S. first joined NATO. During the Senate debate in 1949 on whether to ratify the North Atlantic Treaty that would formally establish NATO, intervention skeptics raised concerns about binding the U.S. to a collective defense of Europe and wanted to ensure ratification did not supersede the war-making power of Congress. Secretary of State Dean Acheson provided such assurances, saying ratification, “does not mean that the United States would be automatically at war if one of the nations covered by the pact is subjected to armed attack. Under our Constitution, the Congress alone has the power to declare war.”

Today, the faltering will of Congress on matters of war and peace could not come at a worse time. Russian President Vladimir Putin is threatening the use of nuclear weapons in order to defend annexed territory in Ukraine. In a response now seen by the Kremlin as further provocation, Ukraine officially submitted its application for fast-track membership to the NATO alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said of Ukraine, “De facto, we have already proven compatibility with alliance standards. … We trust each other, we help each other, and we protect each other.”

To turn up the heat even more, the U.S. foreign policy establishment believes the U.S. would and should respond to any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, even if solely contained within Ukraine’s borders, all but guaranteeing the conflict would spill into NATO territory. Former CIA Director David Petraeus said, “Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a NATO — a collective — effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.” U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. has had the “opportunity to communicate directly to Russia a range of consequences for the use of nuclear weapons and the kinds of actions the United States would take” but declined to offer any indication of what could be included.

Reinterpretation of Obligations

Why did the U.S. abandon the strategic sanity expressed at NATO’s inception? Over time, a collectivist reinterpretation of U.S. obligations as a part of the NATO alliance emerged, supposing that an invocation of Article V mandates a U.S. military response to both an attacked NATO country as well as protectorates NATO has allowed under its de facto guardianship. Presidents make this collectivist interpretation possible by continually demonstrating an ability to circumvent Congress and engage the U.S. in undeclared, unconstitutional, and often endless wars. It is no wonder Europe feels enveloped in the safety of the U.S. security umbrella and has little incentive to provide for its own defense. It is no surprise Ukraine believes it is entitled to enjoy the same luxury.

The uncomfortable reality is Article V doesn’t require any specific response from any NATO member. The only commitment member states undertake in the event of an armed attack are “such actions as it [each individual member state] deems necessary” to restore the security of the region. No treaty would ever successfully supersede the sovereignty of individual states, particularly not by binding a group of nations to a future war.

The Founders also understood the importance of protecting the self-determination of the United States and the need to guard against foreign entanglements and influence. It is why the power to make treaties is shared. It is why Congress and Congress alone is vested with war-making. But the protections only work if Congress plays offense against the reckless global gallivanting of the president and defense against its own internal temptations.

Congress Failing

Congress is failing on both accounts. President Joe Biden’s promise of unwavering support for Ukraine, deployments to the European theater, and massive arms commitment have all gone completely unchecked. In fact, Congress continues to blindly affirm, in a bipartisan fashion, policies toward Ukraine that make it nearly impossible for the U.S. to exercise any restraint as the risk of being drawn into nuclear war in Europe grows.

For the American people, burnt out on years of endless wars in the Middle East, Congress must draw red lines. Romney is wrong. Now is exactly the time for Congress to find its backbone. President Biden and NATO need a reminder that Ukraine is not a NATO ally, and even if it were, no military response could go forward without a vote of Congress. Passive members of Congress that allow anything less do not deserve another term.

I Won’t Go To War With Russia For Randi Weingarten,"After news broke on Monday that Russia launched missiles at several Ukrainian cities, the president of the second-largest teachers union in America announced she was “heading to the border now to assess the situation.”

“This Russian attempt to frighten civilians & the effect on children (who are learning online today) is why this [Ukraine] trip is so important,” American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten tweeted.

What is the woman infamous for sentencing American children to school on screens doing in Ukraine other than making herself a Franz Ferdinand-like target and possibly violating the Logan Act? Especially since the U.S. Department of State has ordered Americans “not travel to Ukraine due to Russian military invasion.”

According to the AFT, which sponsored the trip, Weingarten’s presence in Ukraine is supposed to “offer solidarity and support in the face of relentless attacks that have forced hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee the country’s east.”

Frankly, that’s not a good enough reason to be gung-ho about celebrities such as Ben Stiller, Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, Liev Schreiber, Jessica Chastain, and now leftist pawns such as Weingarten making the dangerous pilgrimage East with the hopes that they can “make a difference” in Ukraine. These American civilians have no business traveling to Eastern Europe in the midst of a conflict that is teetering on the edge of nuclear war, even if they are just trying to “do something” beyond putting the performative blue and yellow flag in their Twitter bios.

Already, American warmongers including President Joe Biden have threatened escalation if Russia continues its rampage in the East. The last thing the United States needs after funneling more than $67 billion to the Volodymyr Zelensky regime without any accountability or oversight is to have an American injured or dead thanks to their reckless travel. There’s no doubt that any incident of consequence would be used as an excuse to take U.S. involvement from proxy war to direct conflict.

In a video posted by the AFT on Monday, Weingarten confirmed that she has decided to remain in Lviv despite an increased risk of danger and death to continue showing “solidarity” for the Ukrainians.

“We’re not going to let Putin get away with terrorizing people,” Weingarten pledged.

Yet, if she is harmed while frolicking about Eastern Europe, Weingarten will be the excuse used to drag the U.S. into war. That’s problematic largely because an overwhelming number of Americans, such as myself, don’t want to be involved in what could quickly become World War III.

Under normal circumstances, I would celebrate Weingarten’s distance from the American teachers and schools she lives to indoctrinate with leftist propaganda. But when Weingarten’s desire to travel to a warzone risks America’s peace, I want her back on U.S. soil as quickly as possible.

The Stupid War On Russian Literature,"“Yes,” says the latest edition of The Economist, “the Russian literary canon is tainted by imperialism.” Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has called into question “not just the value of reading” Russian classics, says the magazine, “but also the morality.” As it happens, I’m a big fan of Russian literature and classical music. For me, the novels of Dostoevsky are still imminently readable — which is more than I can say for The Economist.

In The Times Literary Supplement, Oksana Zabuzhko, a Ukrainian writer, “argued powerfully,” The Economist points out, that Western readers of major Russian authors have ignored their “imperialist attitudes and indulged their drastic moral relativism and sympathy for criminals.” These books, the author claims, are “the camouflage net” for Russian tanks in Ukraine.

This is insanity. Soon after Putin’s invasion, symphonies and opera houses began shutting down Russian artists and performances. Carnegie Hall removed Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, and Metropolitan Opera dropped opera singer Anna Netrebko. The Polish National Opera canceled performances of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov,” and the Cardiff Philharmonic dropped Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” over its bellicosity. The Russification of Ukraine was most intense under Soviet rule, so why allow anyone to play Prokofiev or Shostakovich? Next thing you know Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade” will be banned for normalizing cultural appropriation.

The attack on Russian writers is worse. I will admit to knowing little about the “imperialist bent” of the renowned poet and novelist Pushkin, who apparently wrote verse trumpeting Russia’s “might” in the 1830s. Though a critic of the tsars and champion of the downtrodden, a Ukrainian critic points out, the poem “To the Slanderers of Russia” is a broadside against the French-backed Polish uprising against the tsar in 1830. Pushkin was apparently still sore about Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812. (Napoleon promised the Poles, and many other “colonized” ethnic minorities in Europe, self-determination. Colonizer or liberator?)

Leo Tolstoy, notes The Economist, is guilty, as well, for neglecting “the perspectives of the colonised peoples of eastern Europe.” (Presentism will end up making virtually anything written before 2000 problematic.) Though, in the end, the novelist “repudiates militarism and violence” so he’s OK. One can’t say the same for Dostoevsky, the magazine alleges, whose novels are “laced with colonialist ideas” that are expressed “in spiritual rather than militaristic terms”:

In the past readers have seen Dostoyevsky as a sublime guide to the darkest, most secret reaches of the human heart. Today he and other Russian writers can instead seem to point the way to the front in Donbas.

Accusing Dostoevsky of empowering Putin is quite the charge. What are these “egregious examples” of Dostoevsky’s Russian “chauvinism” and colonialist mindset that directly led to the invasion of Ukraine? We are offered two. The first, an essay entry in his final book, “Diary of a Writer,” in which Dostoevsky cheers on the Russian expansion into Asia — an imperialist race that nearly every major European power participated in.

The second is a remark by Prince Myshkin — the protagonist in his novel “The Idiot” — in which he refers to Catholicism as “unchristian.” Myshkin, for those of you who haven’t read the chaotic novel, is Dostoevsky’s sanctified version of a Russian Orthodox Christian man, a figure so chaste and uncomplicated that he holds no ill toward anyone — not even those who plot against him. This innocence leads others to believe he is a simpleton. “The Idiot” certainly idealizes traditional Russian theology and culture. Dostoevsky believed, as Barack Obama might say, in Russian exceptionalism. He also believed in pan-Slavism. The author wrote most of the book while living in Western Europe, an experience he did not enjoy. But if you believe Myshkin is a proxy for bigotry and war and “colonialism,” or that the writing embraces anything resembling “moral relativism,” you’ve drastically missed the point.*

Ukrainians, incidentally, many of whom still lionize and write patriotic songs about Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera or build statues of Simon Petliurano, who led pogroms against Jews in the early 20th century, should probably be careful arguing that Dostoevsky’s “long-standing hostility to Catholics and Jews” puts him in league with Putin.

“The Idiot,” like many other books of the 18th and 19th centuries, was serialized in newspapers and sometimes touches on contemporary, now-esoteric political debates. There is no evidence that the writer, who was subjected to a mock execution, would have supported the authoritarian quashing of political dissent. Anti-Western sentiment was certainly part of Dostoevsky’s position. He was a conservative and a reactionary, and like many contemporary writers in Europe, he grappled with the meaning of national identity. Putting the writer at the head of a column of tanks for exploring those issues in the 1870s is a transparently risible attempt to cancel Russian culture.

“Those who detest Mr Putin’s invasion of Ukraine need not throw away their copies of the Russian classics,” allows The Economist. Instead, “readers might revisit them with more critical eyes and a renewed sensitivity to imperialist sentiments.” No, thank you. One might simply read great novels as if they were written in their own time and place. It’s not that there weren’t odious ideas in the novels of the 19th century. But Dostoevsky never peddled immorality or “fascistic” notions or violence. There is no need to retcon Russian literature — or music or art — to comport with your contemporary political needs.

*I went back and read the section in “The Idiot” in which Myshkin attacks the rituals and alleged greed of the Roman Church. It’s all very The Great Schism-y. Mostly, though, Myshkin blames Catholics for the deterioration of faith in Europe, joking that if a Russian converts to Catholicism he is “sure to become a Jesuit at once, and a rabid one into the bargain.” Myshkin (wrongly) blames Rome for the rise of socialism, but (rightly) notes that the ideology “seeks to replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to appease the spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by Christ, but by force.” Russia, it turns out, would fall to socialist faith a few years before Italy.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/11/the-stupid-war-on-russian-literature/,2022-10-11
"FDRLST Poll: Voters Affirm Dobbs, Oppose Big Tech Censorship","Voters support the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, oppose Big Tech censorship, and are skeptical of claims that the FBI isn’t corrupted by partisanship, a new poll from The Federalist and Susquehanna Polling & Research shows.

When asked who should set nationwide abortion laws, 48 percent of voters agreed that Americans and their elected state representatives should be able to determine their state’s abortion laws, something the Supreme Court finally allowed in Dobbs after it had previously been prohibited under Roe v. Wade. The poll found that just 26 percent of voters said determining abortion law is the Supreme Court’s job.

Similarly, when asked what they thought of Big Tech companies such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google censoring news stories and preventing users from sharing articles and information related to the upcoming election in November, 66 percent of voters said they disapproved. While 24 percent of voters said they approved of this kind of online silencing, nearly half of registered Democrats, 47 percent, and an overwhelming 85 percent of Republicans said they disapproved of Big Tech’s election-related censorship.

Since the FBI’s presence in the public eye has increased over the last few months, a plurality of voters, 43 percent, said they believe the FBI pushes a political agenda when conducting affairs, raids, and investigations. On the other hand, 42 percent of respondents said they have confidence the FBI acts without partisan influence.

In addition to skepticism of Big Tech and the FBI, a majority of voters, 77 percent, overwhelmingly said that they don’t trust corporate news media to tell them the truth. Majorities of both Republicans, 93 percent, and Democrats, 59 percent, said they believe the media misrepresents the facts to push a political agenda.

When it comes to the nearly $70 billion the U.S. funneled to Ukraine in the last year, a plurality of voters, 47 percent, say that the federal government has spent too much taxpayer money on the war in Eastern Europe. Broken down by party, a majority of Republicans, 57 percent, and 37 percent of Democrats said Ukraine received too much money from the United States. Only 2 percent of respondents said that spending on Ukraine amounted to “too little money.”

Not only is Ukraine spending unpopular in voters’ eyes, but so is the GOP’s Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. According to poll results, only 11 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of McConnell just one month ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. A majority, 60 percent, say their perception of McConnell is largely unfavorable.

As for President Joe Biden’s personal favorability ratings, the poll found that 45 percent of voters approve of the job Biden is doing as president while 49 percent say they disapprove. Regardless of their personal interpretation of Biden’s track record, voters decisively disapprove of how Biden has handled key issues such as inflation (52 percent), gas prices (51 percent), immigration (49 percent), and crime (47 percent).

In general, 65 percent of voters say the economy has worsened in the last six months. An even higher number of voters, 88 percent, say that, contrary to the president’s claims, the U.S. is likely already in a recession.

When asked which party they would vote with if midterm congressional elections were held today, voters were split between Republicans, 48 percent, and Democrats, 48 percent.

Endless 'Emergency Powers' Enable Tyranny Like Election Delays,"It’s been nearly a month since Joe Biden told “60 Minutes” “the pandemic is over,” but the federal government he ostensibly controls is still operating under emergency powers originally declared two and a half years ago. The administration told The Daily Caller it plans to renew the state of emergency again before its current expiration on Oct. 13.

The White House and news media have made it plain that the Biden administration is extending the state of emergency for political reasons, not due to a legitimate emergency. USA Today noted that ending the state of emergency would “complicate” government officials’ desire for Americans to take another round of Covid booster shots, as new disclosures show the government secretly paid TV entertainers and pressured social media to push its shot narrative and validate billions in government contracts to pharmaceutical companies. The alleged “state of emergency” is also “keeping millions of Americans on Medicaid” under expansions approved only for “emergency” purposes.

Democrats also want to keep using Covid as an excuse for other wasteful and inflationary “emergency” federal spending on agencies that have demonstrated deep corruption. “And Biden’s controversial decision to wipe out student loan debt for millions of Americans rests on the Education Department’s ability to ease hardship in a national emergency,” USA Today says.

Extending the declaration would also mean the United States will be operating under a state of emergency through yet another hotly contested election. The last time that happened, an estimated 14.8 million mail-in ballots went missing amid widespread vote chaos. Courts largely refused to provide any clarity or accountability amid unprecedented charges of mass illegal voting, election law violations, mismanagement, irregularities, and confusion that in several swing states extended past the entire margin of Biden’s claimed victory.

Permanent Changes During ‘Emergency’ Rule

Given a plausible enough excuse and enough government-generated fear among the populace, in 2020 the majority of local, state, and federal elected officials rolled over to leftists’ clearly tactical demands for degrading election integrity. The so-called “emergency” changes to America’s electoral process largely remain in place today, two years after they resulted in massive social strife and widespread distrust in American elections.

States turned election days into election seasons, increasing the ability of targeted get-out-the-vote tactics to affect election outcomes. Swing districts allowed Democrat activist machines to run their election systems and operate Democrat get-out-the-vote operations through public offices. States filled mailboxes with ballots, millions of which went missing (Wisconsin, where I haven’t lived for more than a decade, sent multiple mail-in ballots for me to my previous addresses, according to my family.)

Mail-in balloting increases ballot error rates to within the margin of many electoral victories, allowing election officials to affect election outcomes by rejecting or accepting votes. Even if every single election official follows every single procedure and every voter fills out his mail-in ballot as accurately as a machine can — which aren’t realistic assumptions — conducting elections this way is a recipe for unrest among those ultimately declared the losers in elections that hinge on razor-thin margins. This is why 70 percent of Democrat voters this year still agreed that Russian interference elected Donald Trump and a majority of Republicans polled around the same time say Joe Biden won in 2020 by cheating.

Covid has been a massively successful excuse for Democrats to seize political power while destroying U.S. infrastructure and our nation’s social fabric. Given how much Democrats have won in just two years making sure this crisis didn’t go to waste, why wouldn’t they keep Americans rolling from one crisis to another, largely of their own making? What incentives do power-mongers have to end not just our technical state of emergency, but to solve any problems whatsoever? Instead, they seem to prefer to keep amplifying crises, because this gives them constant pretexts for abnormal and totalitarian measures.

Never-Ending Supply of Manufactured Emergencies

Consider the other national emergencies Biden has exacerbated while in office. Should Biden lose Covid as an excuse for his administration’s lawless and barely restrained exercise of power, he has several other options. One of them would be turning our nation’s proxy war with Russia over Ukraine into a hot war between nuclear powers. Now, that may be a legitimate national emergency, but it wouldn’t be an accidental one.

There’s also the administration’s full-on jettisoning of the U.S. border to control by international criminal cartels that profit from drug and human trafficking in the absence of U.S.-imposed law and order. These cartels, of course, partner with the real top U.S. adversary, Communist China, in destroying our people and national resources while U.S. officials appear to be distracted covering up the Biden family business operations in Ukraine, which is of no national importance to the United States. Neither is providing security for Europe that Europe should provide for itself.

The growth of inflation under Congress’s two-decade refusal to control its own spending while the United States government endangers the dollar and nears a sovereign debt crisis to rival any in world history would be another manufactured emergency available to use to argue for more control by the same people driving this country into the ground. We’ve so far had essentially zero accountability for the use of this technique during Covid. That’s why we should expect it to continue and expand.

Past Time for Some Serious Checks and Balances

Like Barack Obama before him and whose administration is essentially back in the White House right now, Biden has been a master of executive overreach, which means authoritarianism restrained only by the desire to keep an increasingly emasculated people from actually revolting. Remember Obama’s “pen and phone”? Biden’s are bigger.

His administration is perfecting, for example, the Covid-developed technique of ruling simply by press release. Multiple times now, this administration has issued some edict without issuing an accompanying regulation that civil rights groups can spend the next 15 years challenging while the regulation is assumed to be law as soon as it’s issued, with no input at all from Americans’ duly elected representatives called Congress. This further delays even that modicum of accountability.

Why wouldn’t someone willing to suspend some laws — such as those requiring individuals to pay their own way through college, as they promised — also be willing to suspend other laws? Why wouldn’t someone willing to break some norms, such as nominating a Supreme Court justice who knows jack squat about the Constitution, not be willing to break others, such as never suspending elections?

Why wouldn’t someone willing to lie about what constitutes a “national emergency” for political gain be willing to do the same thing in another way? There is no logical endpoint to this kind of behavior. It could include anything, even something that sounds crazy like suspending elections over a drummed-up “national emergency.”

If you think that’s ridiculous, think back three years to what you’d have said if someone told you that government — including “freedom-touting” Republican governors! — would ban kids from going to schools for months, even years, over a virus that was less risky to them than the seasonal flu. The wild political effectiveness of inflating the “Covid emergency” beyond all reason is why pushing society’s limits in previously unthinkable ways is going to continue until American leaders start actually standing up for the rule of law and imposing some serious limits on executive-branch authoritarianism.

Dear Legislatures: Rein in Rogue Officials Already

That means every single “emergency powers” statute in this country needs to be definitively time-limited, immediately. If presidents and governors can suspend Americans’ rights indefinitely, with no limiting principle, and courts won’t stop them, then we have no rights. Rights secured only at the whim of the executive and after years of delay are not rights at all.

Know what living under unrestrained executive orders is called? Tyranny. Tyrants do whatever they can get away with. So far, that’s been working out pretty blooming well for whoever’s really in charge of Joseph R. Biden. The question is, what else do they think they can get away with? And what prudent and credible steps are Republicans planning to stop them?

What I’m going to do is this: If at any point we don’t have elections, I’m not filing my taxes. Go ahead, raid me over it. The more Americans decide that the federal government is full of lawless thugs, the better. Maybe at some point more conservative officeholders will start doing something about federal raids on people peacefully protesting tyranny. Good luck raiding me when I’m one of 100,000 people doing the exact same thing in localities protected by increasingly uncooperative sheriffs, attorneys general, and state legislatures.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/13/unending-emergency-powers-enable-authoritarian-behavior-such-as-suspending-elections/,2022-10-13
Democrats Are Desperate To Distract Voters From The Real Issues,"Americans know the country is in trouble, which is why President Joe Biden and his Democrat allies are doing everything they can to distract voters from the crises plaguing America with the hope that it will save them from getting stripped from the halls of power in the upcoming midterm elections.

A new poll from Harvard-Harris found that, despite the left’s best attempts to focus voters on issues such as their extremist abortion and climate agendas, Americans care more about the economy, the border crisis, and crime.

Thirty-seven percent of voters say inflation and price increases are the biggest issues facing the country today. Right behind that is the economy and jobs, which 29 percent of voters think is a No. 1 problem. Approximately 23 percent of voters say immigration is at the front of their minds, while another 18 percent said crime and drug issues are most important. And considering that pollsters typically frame these surveys to shape public opinion in favor of Democrats, that these issues still emerged as voters’ top four concerns shows how important they are.

Meanwhile, only 17 percent of voters cited vague “women’s rights” as an important issue, and a mere 5 percent of voters said the same about foreign policy. That, however, hasn’t stopped Biden from focusing on inflation overseas and pretty much anything else except inflation at home.

While regular Americans struggle to pay bills, fill their gas tanks, and take their families out for ice cream on occasion, Biden, nibbling on a double dip of chocolate chip in a waffle cone, lied in a Baskin-Robbins in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday that the flailing U.S. economy is “strong as hell.” The president also denied having any concerns about the value of the U.S. dollar in our heavily inflated economy, something 9 in 10 voters say they worry about.

“I’m concerned about the rest of the world,” Biden said to the gaggle of reporters watching him eat. “Inflation is worldwide. It’s worse off than it is in the United States. So the problem is the lack of economic growth and sound policy in other countries, not so much ours.”

BIDEN, eating ice cream: ""Our economy is strong as hell"" pic.twitter.com/x5dyCg14l3 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) October 16, 2022

Americans’ top priorities (the economy, immigration, and crime) haven’t changed much since polling for the midterms first began. In fact, more and more voters, currently two-thirds, say the country under a Democrat-controlled White House and Congress is on the wrong track.

Yet the Biden administration and Democrats on the campaign trail have not only failed to address any of voters’ biggest worries but they are doing everything they can to use other problems as distractions, such as hyperventilating over Ukraine and threatening nuclear war with Russia, or capitalizing on the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision. Despite the deeply unpopular nature of Democrats’ unregulated, on-demand abortion extremism, the left has teamed up with the corporate media to make abortion their top priority going into the midterms. That’s why even vulnerable candidates have committed millions of dollars and time to promote the unrestricted killing of unborn babies through all nine months of pregnancy without any scrutiny from major media outlets.

Similarly, the Biden administration has sought to cover up the nation’s economic woes and Congress’s expensive and bloated bills by directing the press’s fawning attention to the global “climate emergency.” Instead of working to curb inflationary spending, acknowledge there is a recession, and address the disastrous border crisis, Biden has used his executive authority to declare that “climate change is a clear and present danger to the United States.”

While Republicans capitalize on the top issues facing Americans, several Democrat candidates have followed in Biden’s footsteps in declaring that “climate change is the greatest threat facing our country and our world.”

All across the country, blue candidates have shirked debates and questions about their role in exacerbating the current crises. Some, such as Sen. Ron Johnson’s challenger Mandela Barnes, have gone so far as to try covering up their connections to the harmful policies that frustrate constituents.

With their eager allies in the corporate press, Democrats have refused to take responsibility and instead tried to convince voters that ending preborn human lives, funneling tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine, and learning what flavor of ice cream Biden prefers are of utmost importance — especially as Nov. 8 nears.

"While The West Dwells On Ukraine, Xi Touts Plan For CCP Empire","Chinese dictator Xi Jinping forecast his government’s plans to further expand Marxist tyranny throughout China and the world during a nearly two-hour-long speech on Sunday, which included direct references to Beijing’s ambitions toward Hong Kong and Taiwan.

While speaking before the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) 20th National Party Congress, Xi highlighted numerous domestic and foreign policy issues, including the country’s ongoing bid to limit the spread of Covid-19 by any means necessary. Since major case outbreaks became known earlier this year in cities such as Shanghai, the CCP has embraced a “Zero Covid” strategy, which the government has used to cripple the few existing freedoms of the Chinese people. As a result, citizens have been forcibly locked in their homes against their will, with food shortages and lack of access to medical care becoming commonplace.

Despite the proven failures of lockdown-style policies, Xi took the time during his Sunday speech to reaffirm the CCP’s commitment to “Zero Covid,” while giving no indication as to when such policies would cease.

“In launching an all-out people’s war to stop the spread of the virus, we have protected the people’s health and safety to the greatest extent possible and made tremendously encouraging achievements in both epidemic response and economic and social development,” Xi claimed.

Frustrations with the government’s Covid approach seem to be boiling among segments of the Chinese population, with protest banners calling out Xi by name popping up in Beijing a few days prior to the CCP’s quinquennial meeting.

But Xi’s celebratory mood over his regime’s embrace of tyrannical methods didn’t just stop at Covid. During the same speech, Xi proceeded to champion China’s unilateral takeover of Hong Kong, the nearby semi-autonomous region that once enjoyed basic freedoms before Beijing’s passage of a “national security” law in 2020 that allowed the CCP to extinguish the city’s dissenting voices.

“In the face of turbulent developments in Hong Kong, the central government exercised its overall jurisdiction over the special administrative region as prescribed by China’s Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” Xi said, pushing the CCP narrative. “It ensured that Hong Kong is governed by patriots. Order has been restored in Hong Kong, marking a major turn for the better in the region.”

In continuing his discussion of foreign policy, Xi also went on to emphasize China’s growing ambitions towards Taiwan, saying that while the CCP “will continue to strive for peaceful reunification,” it will “never promise to renounce the use of force” and “reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.”

“The wheels of history are rolling on towards China’s reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The complete reunification of our country must be realized and it can without a doubt be realized,” he said to applause from the more than 2,300 gathered delegates.

Following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island back in August, Taiwan has experienced an increase in Chinese military activity around its territorial waters and airspace, including a series of live-fire drills orchestrated by the People’s Liberation Army. A Chinese takeover of the island would almost assuredly lead to a decimation of Taiwan’s democratic government, as well as its free market economy and the civil liberties of the Taiwanese people.

Having served two terms as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 2012, Xi is widely expected to secure a rare, third term during the party’s meeting this week. Since coming to power, he has steadily increased the authoritarian nature of China’s communist government, while also working to expand the country’s power on a global scale.

By and large, Xi’s continued push for Chinese dominance throughout the world has largely gone unchallenged by the West, whose nations have routinely cowered in the face of aggression from the CCP while increasing their entanglements in the Russia-Ukraine war. In addition to their silence over China’s “Zero Covid” barbarism, the West also sent their greatest athletes to Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics and have refused to hold China’s government to account for covering up the origins of Covid-19.

Threat Of War Reminds Why Selling Out To China Was A Bad Idea,"A new report confirms former President Bill Clinton was delusional about the long-term effects of trade with China on American workers and the U.S. economy.

In 2000, then-President Clinton deployed much of his political capital to help China become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Clinton promised the American public that economic engagement would be a “win-win” for both the U.S. and China because free trade would “move China faster and further in the right direction.” Later that year, Clinton signed a trade bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China and allowing Chinese goods to enjoy the same low-tariff access to the U.S. market as many other nations did. China joined the WTO in 2001 and began two decades of double-digit economic growth.

Now we can see that the economic engagement failed to make Communist China more open and democratic. Instead, China transitioned from a poor authoritarian regime into a rich and powerful one at America’s expense.

Thanks to low-tariff access, inexpensive made-in-China goods flooded the U.S. market. In “The China Shock and Its Enduring Effects,” researchers at the Stanford Center on China’s Economy and Institutions define the China shock as a period between 2000 and 2012, reaching “peak intensity in 2010.”

Massive Job and Income Losses

The researchers found that the China shock was responsible for nearly 60 percent of all manufacturing job losses in the U.S. between 2001 and 2019. The job loss hit workers who worked in “narrowly specialized, labor-intensive manufacturing (e.g., furniture making)” and those without college degrees the hardest. A succession of U.S. administrations did little to provide the necessary training to help these workers transition to other growth sectors. Consequently, researchers found that “manufacturing job losses caused by the China trade shock converted nearly one for one into long-term unemployment.”

Traditionally, manufacturing had been a pathway for scores of working-class Americans to move up to the middle class. But the shrinking manufacturing sector and the job losses essentially removed that economic ladder for many Americans. Researchers estimate that “6.3% of the U.S. population experienced absolute declines in real incomes” because “the gains from trade with China — primarily lowered consumer prices” and the government’s welfare benefits were insufficient to cover their income loss. The income decline was especially severe among men. According to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, “the median income of men without secondary school diplomas fell by 20% between 1990 and 2013; for men with secondary school diplomas or some college, median income fell by 13%.”

Researchers compared the economic impact of the China shock to other events that had caused great economic distress in U.S. history, including the 2008 financial crisis. They concluded, “while the impacts on employment, earnings, and population from import competition with China were qualitatively not unique relative to these other shocks, the large magnitude of the China trade shock and the extreme variation in labor market outcomes were without precedent.”

As John Mitchell, president and CEO of IPC, a global trade association representing electronic equipment, wrote in The Hill, “for more than three decades, the United States government has prioritized globalization while deprioritizing the strength and resiliency of its industrial base.” Meanwhile, many American businesses shut down their factories and relocated them to China in pursuit of lowering costs and maximizing profits.

Even after learning about the economic pain many American workers endured due to these shortsighted decisions, certain globalization advocates still refuse to budge. At an event organized by the Cato Institute, Adam Posen, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a D.C.-based think tank focusing on free trade issues, said that a focus on domestic manufacturing is simply a “fetish for keeping white males with low education in the powerful positions they are in.”

Posen couldn’t be more wrong. A robust domestic manufacturing industry is crucial for our economy and American workers’ well-being and is vital to national security.

Lack of Industrial Base Weakens U.S. Security

Probably for the first time in decades, the United States is getting dangerously close to engaging in a war with one or two major powers in the world. In Europe, the Biden administration is sleepwalking the U.S. into deeper involvement in the Ukraine war. Both Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration has sent Ukraine weapons worth billions of dollars and depleted the U.S. military’s inventory of ammunition and weaponry. Yet the Pentagon reportedly has been very slow to replenish arsenals and has sparked concerns that the shortage could jeopardize American military readiness. Poor planning and incompetency of those in charge probably contributed to the arsenal shortage. Also, ramping up production takes workers and time. The U.S. manufacturing industry faces a persistent skilled labor shortage. According to The Wall Street Journal, even if the industry has all the workers it needs, “In the U.S., it takes 13 to 18 months from the time orders are placed for munitions to be manufactured. … Replenishing stockpiles of more sophisticated weaponry such as missiles and drones can take much longer.”

But Communist China will not wait for the U.S. to restock ammunition and weapons. After years of military buildup, China’s invasion of Taiwan is no longer a question of “if” but “when.” Suppose President Joe Biden meant what he said about sending U.S. troops to Taiwan if China invades the island. Will the U.S. military have all it needs to protect itself and defend our allies?

Hal Brands, a military strategist, wrote, “Modern war is prodigiously costly. … It consumes epic quantities of missiles, artillery shells, and other munitions; it can wreck hard-to-replace planes, tanks, and warships in large numbers.” He points out that the U.S. and its allies won World War II partially due to the United States’ “industrial-age, mass-production economy that was well-suited to making the tools of global war.” Our nation essentially out-produced Germany and Japan and kept the U.S. and its allies in the war long enough to win.

Yet after decades of decline of the U.S. manufacturing industry, Brands said, “America lacks even the basic building blocks, such as adequate machine tools and a trained labor force, that it would need for wartime mobilization.” Meanwhile, China’s “shipyards and factories are spitting out warships and munitions at an astounding rate.” According to economist Noah Smith, “China can manufacture enough to sustain both itself and Russia” in a global armed conflict with Western democracies.

The research on the China shock’s economic toll on America’s economy and workers, the ongoing Russia and Ukraine war, and China’s continued military threat to Taiwan should all serve as a reminder that for the sake of America’s peace, prosperity, and security, we must refocus and revive our domestic manufacturing industry.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/18/threat-of-nuclear-war-reminds-us-why-selling-out-manufacturing-to-china-was-a-horrible-idea/,2022-10-18
Americans Shell Out Or Shiver As Biden Ships Energy To Europe,"A trend is emerging in the Biden administration’s foreign policy, a perpetual obsession with supporting Europe above and even at the expense of U.S. needs at home.

In response to attacks on the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline system, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the situation in Europe a “tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy.” Blinken went on to tout the ability of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers to meet heightened European demand, conveniently forgetting it was the Biden administration’s executive actions that stifled production capacity within its first 100 days in office. Careful, Mr. Secretary, with too much premature boasting.

Blinken’s naïve comments, practically salivating at the idea of saving Europe, indicate just how much the Biden administration does not want the war in Ukraine to end. The conflict has become the administration’s sacred cow, allowing it to cover up domestic political blunders and receive heaps of praise from European elites, perhaps the toughest crowd globally for the U.S. post-Trump. What goes unsaid is that all this European love comes at the expense of the interests and bank account balances of American households.

U.S. LNG exporters are, for the moment, enjoying a hefty payday. Data from the first half of 2022 show the U.S. became the world’s leading exporter of natural gas, with a 12 percent increase from the second half of 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration. Compounded by disruption in Russia’s ability to export to Europe, the U.S. sent 70 percent of its exports last month alone to Europe. Compared with the same timeframe last year, exports to Europe hovered at only about 20 percent of overall U.S. exports. As New England competes with Europe for LNG supply, the region’s power grid operator has warned of possible blackouts this winter. Meanwhile, energy companies have been profiting approximately $200 million per shipment to Europe thanks to record prices there. With a continued influx of U.S. supply, Europe’s prices are likely to start to come down.

But let’s not forget that American producers haven’t had the best relationship with the Biden administration. Almost immediately upon entering office, President Joe Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline and mandated numerous new environmental rules and regulations with executive orders. American producers may be getting a fat payday thanks to Europe, but sustainable long-term production at home remains in jeopardy.

Price Increases at Home

But what about prices for American households this winter? U.S. energy prices have reached 14-year highs, sparking calls domestically for a freeze on exports abroad heading into winter to ensure a strong U.S. supply that will directly benefit U.S. consumers. The Biden administration said no thanks. Reuters reports the White House has “ruled out any ban or curbs on exports this winter” with a senior administration official quoted as saying “because of the steps we and our partners have been taking, gas storage in Europe is at a significantly higher level than last year. More work remains” as part of the rationale for the decision.

Meanwhile, as the White House ensures Europe is nice and warm this winter, U.S. households should brace for an estimated average 17.2 percent increase (approximately $1,202) in home heating costs, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association (NEADA). In certain parts of the country, this could mean a more than 50 percent increase in the price printed on the monthly energy bill. NEADA further warned it should not come as a shock if low-income families fall behind on their bills as a result. How kind of the White House to volunteer the poorest American families to go cold on behalf of Europe this holiday season.

Europe’s Culpability

While the war in Ukraine is a significant factor in the disruption of LNG access, Europe is also culpable for its hefty reliance on an adversary for an essential energy source. The radical climate agenda of the European Union, which overemphasizes the use of green energy sources without the appropriate storage capabilities, means the continent cannot escape the use of traditional sources like LNG for now.

Despite attempts under the Trump administration, which fostered a regulatory environment that made greater U.S. production possible, to strike a deal to increase exports to Europe, these efforts were rejected on the grounds that American LNG is “too dirty” for EU standards. So Europe continued to rely nearly exclusively on Russia, which according to a 2019 U.S. National Energy Technology Laboratory study emits more greenhouse gases than European coal. The same study found U.S. LNG releases up to 56 percent fewer emissions than European coal. Yes, Europe, Russia as your greatest continental adversary with dirtier fuel is a better choice than having to do any business with President Donald Trump. Further, the continent seems all too happy to burn American LNG now that its preferred political party controls the White House. The Biden administration is free to fawn over Europe, but please stop selling the continent’s energy predicament as the stuff of martyrdom.

Entrenchment in Europe should enrage Americans all the way to the polls this November. From a national security perspective, the U.S. is sacrificing its own security interests in the Indo-Pacific and on the southern border by cutting big checks to Ukraine and subsidizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, exercising little restraint despite military realities. But fold in energy and economic policy, and the effects hit even closer to home. White House elites are further straining American households’ finances, proving nothing is off limits in the name of protecting and nursing Europe back to health. American patience will rightly wear thin, and no one in Washington should act surprised at a fervor to trade Europe First for a return to America First.

Destroying America’s Energy Advantage To ‘Save Democracy’,"Engaging in cynically self-serving partisan behavior to win elections sounds profoundly corrupt. Engaging in cynically self-serving partisan destructive behavior to “save democracy” … well, that sounds profoundly rational. And so it goes.

“We find ourselves in a situation, where keeping gas prices low is key to preserving and strengthening the future of our democracy,” MSNBC’s Chris Hayes admitted last night. “And so here we are. Hence, Biden releasing oil from the reserves today.”

There is no policy justification for emptying the emergency strategic oil reserve right now. Just as there is no reason to use emergency powers to force taxpayers to foot the bill for graduate student loans. Just as there is no foreign policy justification for threatening the Saudis to keep production high until the midterms when you keep undercutting domestic production and capacity.

The crass partisanship is even worse than Hayes lets on, since emptying the strategic reserve is a little more than political kabuki theater. The Energy Department is going to release 15 million barrels this week so that families will have some “breathing room,” says the president. But the United States uses nearly 20 million barrels every day. Fifteen million barrels might be useful in a national disaster — which we would be unprepared for right now — but in this environment, it does nothing but give Democrats “breathing room” to pretend they’re doing something.

“I have been doing everything in my power to reduce gas prices since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine caused these price hikes — these prices to spike and rattled international oil markets,” Biden said Wednesday. When Biden told a town hall audience in September 2019 that he would end all new drilling on federal lands, the national average for a gallon of gas was $2.56. That was more than two years before Putin invaded Ukraine. When Biden was inaugurated, long before the Russian invasion, the price of a gallon was $2.38. It was one cent higher when he signed an executive order pausing all new government leases on public lands — where nearly a quarter of American oil extraction takes place. Since then, Biden has handed out the fewest new leases for a president early in his administration since World War II.

Putin hadn’t invaded Ukraine the day Biden killed the Keystone pipeline, and with it 830,000 barrels per day – around 25 million a month —which was scheduled to open in only a few months. Nor had he invaded Ukraine when the Interior Department stopped pursuing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. All these actions put us in a precarious position when the inevitable international event shook the market.

Biden can’t control prices, of course, but there are plenty of things he could do to mitigate the pain outside of incentivizing production. Instead of easing sanctions on the socialist kleptocracy in Venezuela, or begging authoritarian cartels to drill more until the midterms, Biden could repeal the Jones Act and lower costs. He won’t because Democrats need union cash. Biden could help increase domestic production by pressuring governors to overturn fracking bans, but he won’t, because he needs to pacify the climate warriors.

Instead, Biden spins Bernie Sanders-style conspiracy theories about oil company cabals and price gouging. It’s amazing that it took decades for these CEOs to concoct a plan to control a fungible commodity, not to mention the layers of taxes and costs and unpredictable events that impact price. Even if the president’s ham-fisted populist messaging was working, why would the oil industry plow billions into new projects when Democrats promise to destroy their business in a few years? Eliminating the fossil industry, we should not forget, is one of the central objectives of the Democratic Party.

Even now, Biden is still babbling on about increasing American oil production “without delaying or deferring our transition to clean energy.” If you allow the availability of reliable and, generally, affordable energy to increase, no one will use “clean” energy. Why do you think the left pushes price-fixing schemes, mandates, and subsidies, and creates artificial scarcity for the competition? Some people believe we must unwind modernity to save the planet. If Chris Hayes is willing to sacrifice the planet in 2022 to “save democracy,” what about 2024 or 2028? Will there be one-party rule by then? Will we be completely reliant on windmills and sunshine by then?

One strongly suspects the next time Democrats push a climate bill, it too will exist to save democracy. What doesn’t these days?

Right now, though, emptying the strategic reserve for some short-term political gain, and promising to refill it at high prices, is at best stupid and at worst corrupt. But I guess if you plug “save democracy” into your moral calculus, you can rationalize anything.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/20/destroying-americas-energy-advantage-to-save-democracy/,2022-10-20
Fake Accents And Sassy Dance Moves Won't Save AOC,"Image Credit Benny Johnson/Twitter

In a town hall in Queens, New York, on Wednesday night, self-proclaimed socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is up for re-election, responded to her enraged constituents in a fake Latino accent: “All right, all right, listen! All right, listen! Listen OK, listen!” The congresswoman also danced mockingly to the beat of angry voters chanting, “AOC has got to go!”

How absolutely humiliating.



Watch. pic.twitter.com/Ap8sFJJei2 — Danny De Urbina (@dannydeurbina) October 20, 2022

It’s unclear whether the dancing was meant to be funny, cute, or dismissive. Her furious constituents, concerned about crime rates and gender-bending craziness, continued to heckle.

It’s also unclear if using the accent was meant to mock her predominantly Hispanic constituency, or if she was trying to garner Latino cred. This wouldn’t be the first time AOC has used fake accents. The congresswoman has used a “blaccent” in the past, perhaps taking a cue from another Democrat superstar, Hillary Clinton.

AOC really likes using race to her advantage. In a 2020 interview during the Black Lives Matter race riots when left-wing attention was centered on black Americans, AOC said, “I always say Latinos are black,” causing many to speculate the comment had to do with her desire to be the “biggest victim.” And in a recent GQ interview, AOC tried to brandish her victim status by claiming she may not be alive by September due to the country’s hatred for “women of color” such as her.

In a surprising turn for New York’s liberal 14th District, AOC’s constituents have been unafraid to show their dissatisfaction with her. At yet another town hall in the Bronx, she was lectured by constituents for voting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Liz Cheney to send yet another $725 million to Ukraine on top of the billions in taxpayer dollars the U.S. has already sent. “You’re voting to start a nuclear war,” her constituents told her. Rather than giving an explanation for her vote, AOC scolded her constituent for supposedly speaking out of turn.

Another constituent called her a sell-out and a war hawk: “Tulsi Gabbard, she’s left the Democratic Party because they’re a bunch of war hawks. You ran as an outsider, yet you’ve been voting to start this war in Ukraine. You’re voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China. Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?”

My friend @Noggatone and I confronted Congresswoman @AOC on her support for Nuclear War and Ukrainian Nazis. I call her out for being a coward in the face of the party that will push us all into Nuclear war right now. Will she stand up like @TulsiGabbard and fight for peace? pic.twitter.com/aQiQvQSWIN — Jose Vega — Vote Diane Sare! (@JosBtrigga) October 13, 2022

The left’s radical agenda isn’t working for Americans. Whether you are on the right or the left, families are feeling the 40-year record-high Bidenflation. Every day it’s harder to afford gas, groceries, and heating bills. On top of all that, millions are terrified of our reckless and self-interested leaders risking nuclear war with Russia.

When people are this angry and scared, sassy dance moves, fake accents, and dismissive narcissism only stoke the flames. AOC’s tired tricks aren’t working anymore, even in New York.

How Did Ukraine's Flag Enter The Pantheon Of Leftist Symbols?,"Enjoying a walk with my wife on a comfortable fall day in the Pittsburgh suburbs, I noticed the village activist’s house in the wealthy neighborhood where we happened to find ourselves. Sitting among a sea of homes with Democratic yard signs, this house aimed a level or two higher. A rainbow was painted on the red-brick exterior. Every important Democratic candidate, from U.S. Senate to state senate, featured prominently. Black Lives Matter had its space, as did the blue-yellow equal sign. Other signs cited pollination-related reasons for the unkempt lawn. The home’s inhabitants believe in science and other things. And — drumroll — there was a Ukrainian flag. One of these isn’t like the others.

This isn’t an anomaly. A casual glance at social media sites will reveal an endless number of Ukrainian flags positioned next to rainbow flags and pronoun badges. As someone who has devoted much of his life to the study of Central and Eastern Europe, I find this all a bit odd. Why does the Ukrainian flag suddenly occupy a place among the fashionable leftist symbols of the moment?

The simple answer is the self-righteousness of our societal elites. For a variety of reasons, sporting a Ukrainian flag offers a reliable mode of virtue-signaling for even those who until recently knew little about the country.

On paper, a war in Ukraine seems an unlikely cause célèbre for the left. Its identity-obsession complex gains little from a people who are Slavic Orthodox Christians, and relatively devout at that. The laws and sociopolitical climate in Ukraine would never be confused for those prevailing in California, Massachusetts, or the Nordic countries. The country’s only numerically significant “diverse community” is… Russian.

Against Russia or War?

Distaste for Russia, then, might be a better way to look at it. Those who refuse to accept that Donald Trump fairly won the 2016 presidential election might hold a lingering hatred of Russia. This explanation might have some validity, but it can’t possibly be the only one, or even the most important. Ukraine, after all, was also linked to the former president in a political show trial. Furthermore, if this flag-waving were more about Russia than Ukraine, we likely would have observed the advent of some directly anti-Kremlin symbol rather than the Ukrainian symbols we do see.

Positions on U.S. involvement in the war also do not fall neatly along a partisan divide. Only 57 Republican congressmen and 11 Republican senators voted against the $40 billion military and economic aid package in May. Former Vice President Mike Pence called opponents of Ukraine military aid “apologists” for Putin. In a Twitter dispute with Elon Musk, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham offered this particularly simplistic advice: “If you want peace in Ukraine — which we ALL do — simply demand Russian [sic] honor the boundaries they agreed to in 1994 and withdraw their forces.” If coastal elites are reacting to a perceived a sense of “Russia love” among Republicans, this isn’t grounded in facts.

Abhorrence to scenes of invasion and war also doesn’t provide a satisfactory explanation. The long war in Syria, in which Russia was also heavily involved, elicited no similar reaction in the United States. We’re unlikely to see a slew of Taiwanese flags if China follows through on its saber-rattling — bank on that. If this is a matter of particular sensitivity to a war in the global West, then something must have changed dramatically since the former Yugoslavia tore itself apart in the 1990s.

How Do Elites Explain It?

Since none of these obvious explanations are convincing, we might as well examine what societal elites themselves say on the topic. New York Times columnist David Brooks proposes the vague distinction of “liberal nationalism,” as opposed to “illiberal nationalism,” for which he cites Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as examples. He writes, “Volodymyr Zelensky is a nationalist. He is fighting not just for democracy but also for Ukraine — Ukrainian culture, Ukrainian land, the Ukrainian people and tongue. The symbol of this war is the Ukrainian flag, a nationalist symbol.”

Brooks also notes the obvious irony of “many people in this country who are proud to wear the Ukrainian flag but wouldn’t be caught dead wearing an American flag because they fear it would mark them as reactionary, jingoistic, low class.” His platitudes about liberalism are unconvincing. Zelensky, hailed the “Churchill of our time,” is guilty of the same corruption, cronyism, and offshore ventures endemic among Ukrainian politicians. If his regime exemplifies the liberal form of nationalism, is the distinction even important?

A Flag of Self

Thus, I propose this explanation for the metamorphosis of the Ukrainian flag: Societal elites and their online foot soldiers must find a way to express their own self-importance and maintain a certain position in society. With Trump playing an increasingly diminished role in American political discourse, a vacuum has developed.

It’s a safe cause. Any reasonable person is opposed to Russia’s senseless war. Rhetorically, Trump can be tied to Putin, and Putin can be tied to Adolf Hitler, all with little risk of pushback or recourse to facts. Unlike China, Russia does not have the ability to exact crippling economic and supply-chain revenge on the United States. And unlike Syria or Taiwan, Ukraine offers a chance to export both war and liberal democracy, a temptation that often proves too great for modern America to resist. It all congeals to fill a Trump-sized self-righteousness vacuum.

A dash of Ukrainian nationalism is hardly the most concerning societal development in the United States today. If it results in greater knowledge of Ukraine and the wider region, that can only be a good thing. Yet, we should resist with all our might any flag-waving self-importance that results in an extension or expansion of a war that benefits precisely no one.

Volodymyr Zelensky Is No ‘Jewish Hero’,"In the course of a Rosh Hashanah sermon this year, one of our cantors characterized American support for Ukraine as a just, moral, and necessary cause. In a ham-fisted attempt to make the point more relevant to the Jewish gathering, he called the president of Ukraine a “Jewish hero.” This was also Gal Beckerman’s term of choice earlier this year in The Atlantic.

Volodymyr Zelensky is a lot of things — including, to be sure, a “hero” to many. But to anyone who takes Jewish identity, Jewish tradition, and, especially, Jewish survival at least somewhat seriously, he certainly should not be considered a “Jewish hero.”

Zelensky was born to Jewish parents. Like that of most Jews from behind the Iron Curtain, his upbringing was markedly secular. As Beckerman rightly points out, “Jewish identity didn’t exist in the Soviet Union, because it couldn’t.” That said, there were Soviet Jews who found their way to some form of Jewish identity after the breakup of the communist empire. Indeed, more than a million immigrated to Israel in a wave that started in earnest at the beginning of the 1990s.

But Zelensky did no such thing. “Zelensky and his family,” Beckerman concedes, “were part of the few hundred thousand Jews who stayed, content to assimilate in a post-Soviet world.” Zelensky has never even shied away from making light of this reality. For instance, in a 2019 interview with the French newspaper Le Point, Zelensky quipped, “The fact that I am Jewish barely makes 20 in my long list of faults.”

Not Jewish

Zelensky married a non-Jewish woman who was baptized, and he and his wife baptized their two children in the Greek Orthodox tradition, according to press reports. Boleslav Kapulkin, the spokesman for Chabad Lubavitch in Odessa, Ukraine, was even under the impression that Zelensky himself had converted to Christianity. Eduard Dolinsky, executive director of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee, went further. He attested that Zelensky is “a Ukrainian with Jewish ancestry; he’s not a member of the Jewish community, he’s not religious, doesn’t keep Jewish traditions and never speaks of himself as a Jew.”

There’s a long-running and complex debate over what constitutes Jewish identity. But there’s no question that Zelensky’s life choices have been inimical to the survival of the Jewish people and the Jewish faith.

Since the end of the Holocaust, Jews have spoken of a 614th additional commandment to the Torah: Thou shalt not grant Hitler posthumous victories. Despite what the secular left and large swaths of liberal Jewry claim, interfaith marriage is an exponentially greater threat to the Jewish people than white supremacy. In 2019, then-Israeli Education Minister Rafi Peretz described the intermarriage rate among Jewish Americans as being “like a second Holocaust.”

Zelensky, like anyone else, is of course entitled to decide whom to marry, what faith to practice, and how to raise his children. But he should not be immune to criticism for being a hypocrite in exploiting his otherwise non-existent Jewishness.

Hostility to Israel

Recently, Zelensky has started to make a habit of referring to his Jewishness in conjunction with pleas for international backing of Ukraine. He blasted Henry Kissinger for calling for a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine War, likening the plea of the former secretary of state and national security adviser to Neville Chamberlain’s infamous appeasement of Hitler in Munich in 1938. He also slammed, of all nations, lo and behold, Israel for refusing to arm Ukraine. (Israel hasn’t armed Russia either.) Now there is reporting that Zelensky is pushing the White House to pressure Israel.

Worse still, Ukraine, under Zelensky, has been rather hostile to Israel at the United Nations, the international forum where the Jewish state has been under sustained assault for decades. According to UN Watch, in a total of 122 resolutions involving Israel, Ukraine has voted against Israel in 95 and abstained in 27. That means it did not vote in favor of Israel once. Yet Zelensky continues to make demands of the Jewish state, which must deal with a Russian presence in neighboring Syria, where Israel conducts counterterrorism operations against Islamic extremists.

Why the Left’s Enthusiasm?

So what are we to make of the enthusiasm for Zelensky the “Jewish hero,” and, moreover, the fact that it’s predominantly on the left? The answer is simple. Zelensky represents not Judaism as it has been known for thousands of years, but the left’s own brand of Judaism. The progressive brand of religion demotes the “outmoded” pillars of authentic faith — custom, tradition, ritual, faith, community, and family.

To be sure, it’s virtually impossible to imagine the left lavishing the same amount of praise upon a Zelensky donning a kippah (head covering) and tzitzit (fringes) and praying three times daily. It similarly would not laud him were he to attend mass and confession regularly.

The left has long wanted Judeo-Christian civilization erased from the face of the planet. From that perspective, it’s easy to see why so many liberals and progressives cheer on an individual wholly detached from anything resembling revealed religion. Sure, Zelensky is a hero to many. If anything, he’s a hero who’s a Jew — not a “Jewish hero.” That’s a distinction worth making.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/11/09/volodymyr-zelensky-is-no-jewish-hero/,2022-11-09
"$66 Billion In, It’s Clear The Realists Were Right About Ukraine","U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has been speaking with high-level Russian officials “to guard against the risk of escalation and keep communications channels open, and not to discuss a settlement of the war in Ukraine,” The Wall Street Journal reports, citing anonymous sources.

It appears the Biden administration has been privately pushing Ukraine to come to the negotiation table, while, bafflingly, providing Ukraine with whatever it wants. On-book U.S. spending on Ukraine’s war is so far about $66.3 billion, the largest foreign government contribution to the war by far.

The Washington Post adds, also citing anonymous sources, that the Biden administration is making:

a calculated attempt to ensure the government in Kyiv maintains the support of other nations facing constituencies wary of fueling a war for many years to come. The discussions illustrate how complex the Biden administration’s position on Ukraine has become, as U.S. officials publicly vow to support Kyiv with massive sums of aid ‘for as long as it takes’ while hoping for a resolution to the conflict that over the past eight months has taken a punishing toll on the world economy and triggered fears of nuclear war.

Consider the stupidity of this strategy. Everyone with an IQ greater than an absent-minded jellyfish knows Ukraine as an independent actor and state wouldn’t even exist without American politicians granting it an open checkbook even during crippling inflation and functionally open borders. But America has to privately beg Ukraine because Washington, D.C., is trapped by its own grandiose rhetoric and foolish decision to give Ukraine billions and advanced weapons. The tail now wags the dog.

No hegemon in human history had to face this ideological trap, not even the Soviet Union with Fidel Castro. Just like Zelensky and his supporters in D.C. today, Castro would have readily dragged Moscow and the world into a nuclear war in 1962. But Moscow had the leash of its satellites, including Cuba, in their hands. America had too, during the Cold War. But the post-Cold War U.S. establishment is not manned by nationalists or realists, and to them, the survival of an “order” is more important than targeted U.S. interests.

That gives rise to scenarios such as Europeans demanding the United States share plans with them when the United States practically dwarves them in aid in a war in their backyard. It’s not just rhetoric but the provision of massive amounts of U.S. cash and weapons, without which the war would have long been over regardless of how well the Ukrainians fought.

Worse, the American government under President Biden spinelessly accepts such sanctimony from foreign governments, ignoring that smaller powers are fanatical about their own survival. The history of the world is lit with examples of smaller states dragging great powers to catastrophic, civilization-ending wars.

There’s one question left unanswered. Why were the realist Republicans called Putinists and fascists when they argued for the same thing the Biden administration is currently doing?

Elon Musk was recently called a Russian agent on Twitter for arguing for peace negotiations, as were David Sacks and Dan Caldwell. The Republicans who voted against further U.S. spending on Ukraine or against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are still regularly derided as extremists for their bold stand with the majority of Americans who don’t want to shoulder the overwhelming burden of a failed internationalism.

In a paper during the early days of the war, I argued we should talk to Russia and reach equilibrium quickly because the asymmetry of interest over Ukraine is stark. Moscow has much more interest in her own backyard than America does. Others argued in Politico that our rhetoric and provision of materiel risks trapping us into an escalatory spiral, a sentiment shared in Foreign Affairs.

“Without a strong United States, there won’t be peace,” explained Hungarian Minister of Justice Judit Varga in a recent conversation we had. “It is only Russia and the United States who could hammer out a solution for the long term. The Democrat [Congressional Progressive Caucus] letter didn’t work out, and it was expected they won’t be for peace. If we had President Trump and Angela Merkel, the war wouldn’t have happened or would have been a localized conflict.”

But that is not possible because the media and academia’s “opinion hegemony” is determined to push a leftist social revolution, even at the cost of a great-power war. This is the key issue.

Those who seek to fight fascism in Europe are the same ones who claim Republicans who opposed uncontrolled aid to Ukraine and instead want to fund the southern border are fascists. To this ideological echo chamber, there is no difference between Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Musk, Putin, and Hungarian President Viktor Orban. It is one whole global crusade.

A nation-building process that started in Iraq and Libya is headed to Ukraine and will eventually head home. Anyone who opposes this leftist crusade will be termed enemies of progress and fascists.

"New GOP Members Must Put America First, Not Ukraine","As the final results come in, the Republican Party will see at least a few new faces in Congress come January.

Voters took to the polls with inflation as the top issue on their minds. Approximately a third of voters rated it the most important issue, and as a result 7 in 10 of them cast votes for Republicans, Edison Research exit polls show. What is perhaps not clear to the average American is how unrestrained spending on Ukraine and a U.S. energy policy that puts Europe first contributed to skyrocketing inflation and the cost of living reaching unbearable levels for American families. As new Republican members enter the halls of Congress, it is time to turn the “America First” rhetoric into policies that push back against the establishment.

It is no secret that the U.S. posture toward Ukraine has now evolved from arm’s length, emergency support to full-on alliance without a formal treaty. It seems every time more military aid goes out to Ukraine, there are calls from Ukraine for yet more, and establishment members of Congress are all too eager to cut seemingly endless checks. Total aid passed by Congress is now greater than $66 billion, making Ukraine the single greatest recipient of security assistance in a single year since the Vietnam era.

Blank-check diplomacy is already creating a clash between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. McConnell has more or less led the charge on overzealous aid to Ukraine. McCarthy, who is looking to become House speaker should Republicans reclaim the chamber, rallied a vote against another $12.3 billion in military and economic aid for Ukraine. McCarthy tied his position back to the economic pressures that out-of-control spending has placed on the backs of the American people, saying, “I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.” Big-name newly elected members agree with him. Eric Schmitt, the newly elected senator from Missouri, tweeted, “$40 billion to Ukraine but we can’t protect our own southern border? Americans have had enough of Washington’s America Last agenda.”

New Members Must Resist the Establishment

Don’t expect the Republican establishment to let such pushback stand without a fight. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called McCarthy’s sentiment “disgraceful,” and former Vice President Mike Pence said, “We must continue to provide Ukraine with the resources to defend themselves.” Pence also said, “There can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists for Putin.” He’s right, and to clear the air, nothing in the sentiment of putting America’s national interests first includes making Russian President Vladimir Putin a pal. Claims to the contrary are pure fearmongering. To build on the vice president’s maxim, however, there should also be no room in the conservative movement for bystanders who allow Europe to free-ride on American security ad infinitum. To those incoming “America First” Republicans, get ready to fight.

To that end, why should new members care to embrace the fight? The answer is simple. America cannot effectively counterbalance China if it’s embroiled in a modern-day, insanely expensive Marshall Plan as a result of Ukraine. Don’t take my word for it. The head of U.S. Strategic Command warned earlier this month, “The big one (i.e., a conflict with China) is coming. And it isn’t going to be very long before we’re going to get tested in ways that we haven’t been tested in a long time. … We have to do some rapid, fundamental change(s) in the way we approach the defense of this nation.”

Fighting for an America First Foreign Policy

If new members want to make a splash in the foreign policy space, file a bill on day one that diverts appropriated funding from Ukraine to ensuring U.S. naval and air superiority against China or toward securing the southern border.

A fight for an America First foreign policy is not for the faint of heart. It will take legislative creativity, solid messaging to show the American people how much money is flowing overseas to protect European security at the expense of our own, and the courage not to crack under the pressure of the elite establishment and the military-industrial complex.

What is there to gain? The credit for righting the dysfunctional state of American security priorities, and most importantly the respect of the men and women who don a military uniform and are asked to go to the front lines. No more endless wars. No more American bloodshed overseas so defense companies can turn a profit. No more bailing out allies who can and should be leading their own security efforts. Ukraine will be the first test of the new Congress on just how far America First sentiment translates into action. Buckle up and dare to be bold, newcomers.

The Case For Booting Schiff From The House Intel Committee,"After a four-year reign, California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff’s days as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, marked by abuse and grotesque politicization, are finally numbered. But it’s not just Schiff’s chairmanship headed out the door with the incoming Republican majority; it’s his seat on the committee altogether.

On Sunday, GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made clear a trio of liberal lawmakers were on the chopping block for their assignments after the chamber took the unprecedented step of dictating minority committee appointments under Democrat rule. Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was kicked off of her committees just a month after her congressional inauguration.

“Should you become speaker of the House in January, what are you going to do in terms of these Democrats that you have on such important committees?” asked Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. “You’ve talked in the past about removing Ilhan Omar, you’ve talked about removing Adam Schiff, about Eric Swalwell. Will you deliver?”

In January, McCarthy told Breitbart News each would be removed from their respective positions on the Intelligence Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee if he were elected speaker with a Republican majority.

“I’ll keep that promise,” McCarthy told Bartiromo. McCarthy had already been calling for Swalwell’s resignation from the House Intelligence Committee since details surfaced of the Democrat’s close relationship with a since-vanished Chinese spy.

“Eric Swalwell cannot get a security clearance in the public sector,” McCarthy said Sunday. “Why would we ever give him a security clearance and the secrets to America?”

“Adam Schiff, who had lied to the American public time and again, we will not allow him to be on the Intel Committee either,” McCarthy added.

Schiff’s Rise from Russia

Schiff was appointed ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee six months before Donald Trump descended on the golden escalator in 2015. By the time Trump captured the White House, Schiff had become the Democrats’ point man on their prime conspiracy to take down the president and undermine democracy in the form of the Russia hoax. In fact, Schiff was the original Russia hoaxer who claimed repeatedly for years to have evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.

Schiff used his perch on the Intelligence Committee to foment fear that the new Republican president was in fact a Russian agent who colluded with the Kremlin for command of the Oval Office. He did so through leaks and testimony to the media which published claims unchecked, making Schiff’s office an apparent ground zero for the false and damaging narrative of Russian collusion.

In March 2017, Schiff said on MSNBC “there is more than circumstantial evidence” that Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russian government. Two months later, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel investigation to probe whether Trump was indeed guilty of collusion. The two-year investigation run with unlimited resources would eventually come up short of finding one person on the Trump campaign, let alone Trump himself, that colluded with the Kremlin. Schiff responded to Trump’s exoneration by castigating House Republicans and foreshadowing more to emerge that would implicate Trump in an apparent crime.

“In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the Special Counsel, or continued investigative work by Committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate,” Schiff said in a press release. “And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.”

Schiff was right on the money when he claimed more would emerge surrounding the politicized investigations of President Trump, but it’s not Republicans who would end up requiring accountability.

Subsequent revelations from courtrooms, The Federalist’s reporting, and the DOJ inspector general would find gross misconduct by the FBI as deep state actors themselves worked in cahoots with Russian operatives to undermine a presidential administration. The FBI even paid for Russian disinformation to frame President Trump.

As a 2019 report from the DOJ inspector general showed, Schiff himself had been lying about Russian collusion since the inception of the hoax. Booting Schiff from his gig as chairman of the Intelligence Committee is just the start of said accountability. Cutting his time short on the committee altogether is the bare minimum.

From Russia to Ukraine

Once the Democrats’ collusion narrative collapsed under its own weight, despite being bolstered by the Beltway press corps, government bureaucrats, and lawmakers from both parties on Capitol Hill, Schiff took the lead role in amplifying another fabricated scandal to accomplish the top item of their policy agenda: President Trump’s impeachment.

In 2019, Schiff became chair of the Intelligence Committee when Democrats reclaimed the House majority. By the fall, Democrats drew articles of impeachment to indict Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress with claims the president illegally harnessed U.S. military aid to extract concessions from the corrupt foreign government in Ukraine. Trump, the story went, withheld $400 million in military aid from Ukraine until President Volodymyr Zelensky pledged to investigate his own country’s role in the Russia hoax which did irreparable harm to the United States. That investigation would inevitably center around Hunter Biden, son of now-President Joe Biden, who raked in tens of thousands of dollars in excess compensation for a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company despite no prior industry experience.

Schiff presided over the House impeachment hearings as if withholding hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in foreign aid until its recipients act in American interests was even a bad thing, let alone worthy of impeachment. As chair, Schiff’s deposition hearings were held behind closed doors while the committee selectively leaked snippets of testimony to amplify their own narratives to a complicit press. In fact, leaking on the Intelligence Committee became a favorite practice of the congressman, whose habitual leaks made their way uncritically into the pages of The New York Times.

When he wasn’t leaking to the allied press machine, Schiff was making up his own evidence to promote the Democrats’ fabricated narratives. In September 2019, Schiff created his own transcript of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky which was supposed to be the smoking gun that warranted impeachment. In his own rendition, Schiff framed Trump as someone demanding a favor the president never actually requested, but he offered the media a storyline the press ran with, slicing and dicing Trump’s words to fit the pro-impeachment narrative.

Over the course of the first Trump impeachment saga, Schiff also flip-flopped on demanding testimony from the whistleblower who reported details of the presidential phone call to Schiff’s office on Capitol Hill.

“We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff wrote in a Sept. 24, 2019 tweet. In fact, Schiff demanded the whistleblower’s testimony repeatedly until details became public that the whistleblower had coordinated with the California lawmaker, in discussions that were omitted from the official whistleblower process. It was then that Schiff moved to prevent testimony.

Schiff went on to be an impeachment manager litigating the case for Trump’s removal in the upper chamber. Trump was ultimately acquitted of all charges by the Senate, only to be impeached again a year later in a circus trial over the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

Schiff Is a J6 Hoaxer

Schiff has remained laser-focused on Trump’s criminal conviction even after the president left office. True to form, the California Democrat and member of the Select Committee on Jan. 6 went on CNN in June as the panel proceeded with summer show trials to foreshadow evidence of culpability that never came.

“We’ll show evidence of the President’s involvement in this scheme,” Schiff said, presumably in reference to the plans Trump openly supported to halt certification of the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021, as if it were a cover-up for something illegal. (Never mind that Democrats objected to certification in 2001, 2005, and 2017.) Schiff refused to reveal his “evidence,” however, because he didn’t “want to get ahead” of the upcoming hearing.

It was routine commentary from the California congressman who has been at the center of practically every fabricated scandal against President Trump since the pair began to emerge into the national spotlight in 2015. Schiff’s work on the Jan. 6 probe, which wrapped up its hearings this fall with nothing to show, highlights the dishonesty of his tenure.

In December, Schiff doctored text messages between GOP Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Schiff manipulated messages presented at an official hearing to expose “a lawmaker” pressing the vice president to unilaterally deny certification of the electoral college votes as unconstitutional. The message, however, actually came from Washington attorney and former Department of Defense Inspector General Joseph Schmitz, and was merely forwarded by the Ohio congressman.

The message, which Schiff took out of context with added punctuation to make it appear complete and illustrated with a cooked-up graphic, was part of a four-page document that outlined Schmitz’s legal arguments for Vice President Mike Pence’s authority to object to electoral certification from a handful of states. The document was published publicly ahead of Jan. 6 on everylegalvote.com.

The Jan. 6 Committee even conceded that Schiff’s messages were manipulated.

McCarthy isn’t just within his rights as speaker to kick Schiff from the Intelligence Committee, but it would be irresponsible not to.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/11/21/the-case-for-booting-adam-schiff-from-the-house-intel-committee/,2022-11-21
6 Hot-Button Topics To Spice Up Your Family’s Thanksgiving Convo,"In America, there is no better way to kick off the “Most Wonderful Time of the Year” than with Thanksgiving. Filled with food, football, and family, the time-honored tradition of spending time with loved ones while stuffing our faces with turkey makes it a holiday unlike any other.

And while many Americans have grown to cherish such a day, others are stressed out. For the latter, the Thanksgiving feast is just another opportunity to get caught up in those awkward moments when a family member brings up the latest controversial issue in the news cycle. Before you know it, parents are bickering with grandparents, the dog is crying, and that toasty apple pie sitting on the counter ends up going cold.

Seriously, we’ve all been there.

But let’s say this year, your family dinner is a total snooze-fest. So boring, in fact, that the dead turkey sitting on your table picks itself up and leaves.

If you find yourself in such a situation, fear not, for The Federalist is here to help by giving you the latest, hot-button topics to add some flavor to your family’s Thanksgiving dinner conversation.

1. Donald Trump

What better way to add a little pumpkin spice to your family’s Thanksgiving than by bringing up the Orange Man himself? Unlike Joe Biden, who will probably be asleep by the time your family starts eating, Trump comes with a variety of sub-categories ripe for discussion.

Whether it be his tweets and Truths, 2024 candidacy, or covfefe, the Donald is a subject that can revitalize any dull Thanksgiving meal. Plus, if you wear your red MAGA hat, there’s a good chance your uber-liberal aunt will start hurling some pretty gnarly accusations that are bound to stir up a good debate.

2. The 2020 Election

If you aren’t preparing to bring along your copy of Federalist Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway’s best-selling book, “Rigged: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized Our Elections,” to your family’s Thanksgiving Day festivities, then chances are you aren’t doing Thanksgiving right.

While this topic may seem too similar to Trump, the 2020 presidential election comes with its own unique features to help turn up the heat at your family’s Turkey Day. With Big Tech interference, incredibly dishonest media coverage, and an influx of private money to change election operations in states around the country, the 2020 contest presented a bevy of problems you can reference to better inform your relatives of the race’s many issues and shut down those dumb, “election denier” smears.

3. Men Competing in Women’s Sports

Tired of hearing about Uncle Bill’s uneventful life at the office? Then it might be worth your while to bring up the unjust nature of men “identifying” as females competing in women’s sports. That is, assuming that William — I mean, Lia — Thomas isn’t invited to your family’s Thanksgiving.

Caution is advised, however, if you have any relatives in attendance who dye their hair blue, put their pronouns in their social media bios, and still have their “I’m with Her” bumper stickers on their electric cars. At that point, you’ll probably need some earplugs to protect your eardrums against the screeching.

4. The War in Ukraine

While you’d be hard-pressed to find many people who support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the real topic of discussion over the ongoing war is what the U.S. response should be.

Should we send little Timmy to fight in another seemingly endless war? Do we keep writing a blank check to Ukraine for every “y” in Zelensky’s name? And what happens if Russia really does attack a NATO ally?

Much like Biden at a public event, the direction of this conversation could wander off in any direction.

5. Face Masks and Covid Shots

What better opportunity to break Cousin Kevin free from the “Covid cult” than at Thanksgiving dinner? Sure, he may keep six feet away from you since you opted not to get that experimental jab that doesn’t stop viral transmission, but that shouldn’t keep you from trying.

While it may be difficult to hear him through his masking in between bites, saving someone from the clutches of the “masks and jabs forevs!” crowd is one of the best gifts you can give this holiday season.

6. Abortion

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year, abortion has been one of the hottest issues in America. Although it may be fun to mock Democrats’ insanity on the issue, this Thanksgiving may allow you to convey to some of your more lefty relatives the physical, mental, and emotional horrors of abortion.

Yes, it’s a topic bound to cause some friction. But the overall benefit of helping advance the cause of protecting innocent life is absolutely worth it.

President Zelensky Has A History Of Crushing Press Freedom,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been lionized by the Western press since the start of Russia’s invasion, but in the not-so-distant past, many international human rights organizations and concerned Ukrainians were sounding the alarm on dangerous and anti-democratic patterns of behavior exhibited by the president.

On Feb. 3, 2021, Zelensky enacted sanctions on three television stations believed to be affiliated with Viktor Medvedchuk, a leader of the Opposition Bloc party, critic of Zelensky, and duly elected member of parliament.

The channels were immediately taken off air, including Newsone, which had called Zelensky “narrow minded” and quoted Medvedchuk criticizing the president for reneging on his campaign promise of finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in eastern Ukraine.

Zelensky also sanctioned the air travel company used by Medvedchuk and pressured American social media companies such as YouTube to deactivate the accounts of Medvedchuk-affiliated companies, which it ultimately did.

Condemnation from Around the World

Justified by Medvedchuk’s ties to Putin, these actions were nonetheless widely condemned by international, European, and Ukrainian nongovernmental human rights organizations.

Free press advocates such as the International and European Federations of Journalists (IFJ and EFJ), who collectively represent hundreds of thousands of journalists across 140 countries, jointly denounced the decree, calling it “an extra-judicial and politically motivated ban and a blatant attack on press freedom that must be urgently reversed.”

A division within the United Nations released a statement declaring that the decision had not been made by an impartial authority and “lacked proper justification and proportion.”

The National Union of Journalists of Ukraine (NUJU), a group that has repeatedly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, openly criticized the 2021 sanctions: “Depriving Ukrainian citizens of access to media without a prior trial and banning hundreds of journalists and media outlets of their right to work is an attack on freedom of speech.”

Retaliating Against Journalists

Medvedchuk, still a sitting member of parliament at the time, attempted to create a new media organization called First Independent. Zelensky dissolved the outlet a few months later.

Gross negligence on the part of Ukrainian law enforcement in addressing retaliation against journalists also became a central issue internationally and was flagged by U.S. intelligence agencies.

A 2021 U.S. State Department report on Ukraine blamed “government inaction in solving crimes for the emergence of a culture of impunity.”

“Government authorities sometimes participated in and condoned attacks on journalists,” the report went on, citing allegations that “the government prosecuted journalists in retaliation for their work.”

Doubling Down

Ignoring international backlash, on Aug. 20, 2021, Zelensky passed broad sanctions against various digital media publishers, yet again without parliamentary involvement.

Strana, one of Ukraine’s largest outlets at the time, with 24 million visits per month, was a primary target of the sanctions. After its primary website address (Strana.ua) was cut off, the outlet was forced onto another domain (Strana.news), which is still forbidden in Ukraine. Strana’s viewership dropped by more than 94 percent.

Human rights organizations once again found the justification of “pro-Russian” ties uncompelling. The journalistic freedom cohorts IFJ, EFJ, and NUJU, issued a shared statement calling the decree an “extrajudicial action” and lambasted it as a “threat to press freedom and media pluralism in the country.”

“Strana.ua is one of the few remaining opposition media in Ukraine,” said the EFJ.

Freedom House, an American pro-democracy nonprofit once chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, urged President Joe Biden to take a stronger stance against Zelensky’s actions. “Zelensky continues to use executive power, without judicial review, to sanction media outlets, tech platforms, journalists, and websites under the pretext of fighting disinformation,” the group said in an open letter to Biden.

Shutting Down an Opposing Party

Perhaps the most interesting target of the August 2021 sanctions was Anatoly Shariy, a Kyiv-born journalist and blogger with a devoted Ukrainian fanbase who founded a political party in his name in 2019.

The “Party of Shariy” performed relatively well in some localities during Ukraine’s 2020 national elections with several candidates attaining office at the city and regional levels.

The Party of Shariy was among several political parties disbanded by presidential decree at the start of Russia’s war, a decision upheld by Ukraine’s Supreme Court without opportunity for further appeal.

A UN-affiliated organization investigated Zelenky’s sanctions against Shariy and concluded, “Shariy is misportrayed by the authorities as a journalist being pro-Kremlin, pro-Putin, pro-Russian Federation.”

In response to being painted as a Russian sympathizer, Shariy said, “The Ukrainian government comfortably uses such labels against anyone who expresses any criticism. … I have the right to criticize the corruption of the president and the government.”

In the Words of Ukrainians

A local perspective on Zelensky’s press relations is provided by a Ukrainian outlet now familiar to many Westerners, The Kyiv Independent, whose Twitter following rocketed from just 11,400 followers a few weeks before the invasion to more than 2.2 million as it provided English-speakers around the world with live war updates.

Having been celebrated in Forbes earlier this year for its reports on Russian war crimes and op-eds calling for Western sanctions against Russia, it’s difficult to portray the outlet as pro-Kremlin.

Before the invasion, in January 2022, The Kyiv Independent published a piece titled “How Zelensky’s administration moves to dismantle press freedom in Ukraine.”

“The past four months have seen a surge of attempts to control the media,” The Kyiv Independent reported, highlighting the government’s pattern of behavior characterized by “threats of criminal prosecution against media outlets and journalists.”

Condensing the Zelensky presidency in a single sentence, the author wrote, “Instead of improving its dialogue with the press, Zelensky’s government decided to take a more direct route: amplify supporters and pressure critics into silence.”

Rethinking Our Support

Given the stakes of U.S. involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we should consider the image of Zelensky portrayed not only by numerous human rights groups but by his own citizens and compare this to the version pushed by Western media. We should also reconsider our continued military support for Zelensky.

In an environment in which rogue missiles land in Poland and blame is tossed around in a hysterical frenzy, nuclear war is a real possibility.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/05/theres-no-such-thing-as-press-freedom-in-zelenskys-dissent-crushing-ukraine/,2022-12-05
"Under Joe Biden, Threat Of Nuclear War Has Gone Up","Ten months after Russia invaded Ukraine and two years into the disaster-prone Biden presidency, there’s no denying the world is at a greater risk of nuclear escalation — not just in Eastern Europe, but also on the other side of the world in the South China Sea.

A majority of Americans overwhelmingly don’t want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine, especially as the conflict escalates to nuclear levels. Yet, objective reality indicates that, under President Joe Biden’s leadership, the U.S. is not only committed to an indefinite proxy war, but has only increased its contemplation of the use of tactical nuclear weapons.

Just this week, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, admitted that at the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, he believed the chance of nuclear war to be zero. Now, he knows that the possibility of using nuclear weapons has changed.

“Look, Ukraine is a tragedy of monumental proportions, but it could actually be worse because if you asked me a year ago when this war began, ‘What are the chances that it will degrade to tactical nuclear weapons,’ which is sort of a longer way of saying, ‘entering nuclear weapons,’ I would have told you zero,” Netanyahu told Chuck Todd on Sunday’s “Meet the Press.” “Today, I would still say that the odds are very low but they’re not zero. And that could be the greatest tragedy of all because in three quarters of a century, we have not crossed that threshold. We must not cross that threshold.”

Netanyahu isn’t the only one who thinks the world is much closer to nuclear conflict now than before. A majority of Americans, 69 percent, say they are “extremely” or “somewhat” concerned that the world could experience a thermonuclear war within the next five years. That number is up 8 percent since November 2021.

Even corrupt corporate media are willing to acknowledge the risk of nuclear war is “now a daily issue for the Biden administration.”

What they refuse to admit, however, is that Biden’s leadership (or lack thereof) has significantly contributed to that increased threat. Instead of questioning Biden’s penchant for escalation, the propaganda press blames Vladimir Putin not just for his own aggression but also for any failures of the American president.

It’s true that Putin’s wartime rhetoric and actions are not short on portending nuclear disaster, but neither are Biden’s.

“First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,” Biden told attendees at a Democrat fundraiser in New York in October. “I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.”

Biden’s comments paired with the tens of billions of American taxpayer dollars flowing to Ukraine demonstrate that he is not backing down. As a matter of fact, Biden and his administration have done nothing but reassure Americans who say they don’t trust the Democrat to handle this conflict well that if Russia goes nuclear, the U.S. will too.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed that the White House is not above escalation in the form of retaliatory nuclear assault when he staunchly refused to deny that the U.S. would enter a war with Russia if Putin deployed nuclear weapons.

That was after he promised that “any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia.”

“We have communicated directly, privately, and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the U.S. and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,” Sullivan said on “Face The Nation” in September.

White House National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby similarly confirmed that “the stakes are very high right now.”

“The president was accurately reflecting the fact that the stakes are very high right now.”



National Security Council spokesman John Kirby tells @MarthaRaddatz that Pres. Biden’s warning about nuclear weapons follows Putin’s “irresponsible rhetoric.” https://t.co/AVno0YUpZU pic.twitter.com/MOEyFS3mj4 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 9, 2022

The Biden administration hasn’t just signaled the willingness to go nuclear, it has also enabled Putin to escalate with nukes if he wants to. By signing off on Nord Stream 2, Biden helped give Putin the hegemonic confidence he needed to make a power grab in Ukraine.

“Nothing is going to stop them [Russia] now marching deeper into Ukraine, because their gas pipeline system — I mean the Ukrainian one — is going to be redundant pretty soon after the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completely established and fully operational,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki predicted in June of 2021.

Similarly, it was Biden’s laxity with China that opened the door for Xi Jinping to further follow through on his own hegemonic desires. Despite Xi’s recent demonstrations of weaponry, the Biden administration still has made no formal announcement about defending Taiwan against China’s expansion, with Biden instead making off-the-cuff declarations that are quickly walked back by his staff. In the meantime, China is stockpiling hundreds of nuclear warheads.

There’s no denying the Biden administration’s history of seriously discussing nuclear aggravation. Yet, the media deliberately leaves the White House out of their finger-pointing. That decision is especially insulting given the press’s treatment of former president Donald Trump when it came to nukes.

For more than four years, the media and their Democrat allies accused Trump of bringing the world closer to the brink of nuclear war, only to be met with four years of peace. Contrast that with months of Trump accurately noting that the Biden administration’s dangerous pivot towards escalation has the potential to lead us straight into a nuclear conflict with dire consequences.

“We have to be very smart and very nimble. We have to know what to say, what to do. And we are saying exactly the wrong thing. We’ll end up in a World War III,” Trump said at an October rally in Arizona. “We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine, or we will end up in World War III and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”

During another October rally, Trump warned his followers about the “n-word”– “nuclear.”

“The N-word is the nuclear word, and the nuclear word is something that’s not supposed to be discussed. You don’t talk about it. You don’t talk about it, but Putin’s been talking about it,” Trump said.

Instead of taking Trump’s warnings about the threat of nuclear war under Biden seriously, The Washington Post used the moment as an opportunity to accuse Trump of flirting with racism.

As my colleague John Daniel Davidson noted in April, “The chances that Putin will accept total defeat in Ukraine without escalation that involves the use of nuclear weapons, or that involves widening the war, are probably lower than most Americans are comfortable with.” Meanwhile, Xi in China is asserting power over his own people and over his country’s neighbors more aggressively too.

Putin isn’t backing down anytime soon and the Biden administration, as it has publicly made clear, isn’t either. Unless someone gives, the U.S. could be doomed to a nuclear tit-for-tat war with Russia over Ukraine, which Biden is doing nothing to stop. And while the Biden administration is busy dealing with Russia and depleting U.S. defense resources for Ukraine, Xi has pledged his willingness to take “all measures necessary” to expand the Chinese Communist Party’s rule to Taiwan.

May Pearl Harbor's Anniversary Remind Us Of The Gravity Of War,"Early on the second Sunday of Advent in 1941, sailors, soldiers, and Marines stationed in Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor were relieving the night watch in their anchored ships’ engine rooms, getting back from breakfast, and signing out of their night shifts. A few minutes before 8:00 a.m., some noticed foreign-sounding aircraft overhead, “flying very low.” As bombs started falling from planes painted with the red circles of Japan’s “rising sun,” sailors onboard the more than 100 ships in the harbor began yelling to the other men onboard, some still in bed or fighting “hangovers from being on pass the night before.”

Cecil Camp, who was on watch on the USS Utah, recalled running to the sleeping quarters on the ship, where “water was already washing over my bunk.” In the mess hall, he said, “There were several other men there. One asked if he should take his dress blue uniform with him. I told him he wouldn’t be needing that for a good while.”

The only stories we have are ones from those who survived. Just more than an hour after the attack started, three American ships and 169 American aircraft were destroyed, with another 16 ships and 159 aircraft damaged. The death toll was even worse: 2,335 service members and 68 civilians, with another 1,178 wounded. The next day, the United States would declare war on Japan, formally entering World War II. By the war’s end, roughly 418,500 Americans would lose their lives.

In America in recent years, the cost of her wars has been borne by a smaller contingent of sacrificial volunteers and their families than in the days following Pearl Harbor. Politicians send American troops overseas without declarations of war from Congress, which haven’t been invoked since the 1940s. Thousands of American service members lost their lives in Afghanistan before the botched and disorganized withdrawal from the country led by President Joe Biden’s administration saw the deaths of 13 more brave souls.

Today, our government is recklessly depleting its stockpiles and coffers at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Roughly $70 billion in, we’ve spent far more on Ukraine than our own border security budget, and Biden is asking Congress (and therefore taxpayers) to write a check for another $37 billion, which would send the total amount of U.S. dollars spent on Ukraine aid over 12 figures.

As Bloomberg noted in September, “The US reportedly provided one-third of its overall stockpile of Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine in the first, most desperate weeks of the fighting. It may take years for Washington and other countries to replenish their armories.” An unnamed defense official said in August that our “level of 155mm combat rounds in U.S. military storage” is now “uncomfortably low” after supplying Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of rounds. Another said stockpiles are “dwindling.” As the United States deepens its involvement in Ukraine at the expense of our own military preparedness, our president is warning of nuclear “Armageddon,” and media outlets are finally admitting the risk of nuclear war is a “daily issue” for his administration.

The decisions of political powerbrokers in Washington have real and sometimes deadly consequences for the American people, not least the brave men and women who fight their wars (many of whom lean conservative and hail from heartland America, unlike most of the political elites who deploy them). After Pearl Harbor, the nation went to war with a constitutional declaration of war from Congress, with a clear mandate from the populace that would be furnishing its lifeblood. Few would dispute that that war, costly though it was, was worth fighting.

In the history of fallen man, there have been just wars, and there have also been silly wars, needlessly escalated by the hubris or foolishness of political powerbrokers. All wars are tragic. None should ever be entered into lightly or haphazardly.

Far be it from me to use the memory of the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor — or in the long years of global war that followed it — to make a political point. But I hope we can agree that there’s nothing political about pausing today to remember the brutality of war, the sacrifices wars require, and our duty as a nation to strive for peace, so far as it depends on us.

10 Troublemakers Who Belong On Santa’s Naughty List This Year,"After a long and draining 2022, the Christmas season has finally arrived! With bells ringing, Michael Bublé on the radio, and the smell of pine in the air, it is indeed the “Most Wonderful Time of the Year.”

Although Christmas offers a chance to unwind and spend quality time with our closest friends and family, it’s also a time to laugh. And what better way to put smiles on faces than to run through a list of some of the political world’s biggest troublemakers who found themselves on Santa’s Naughty List this year?

1. Anthony Fauci

If one of Santa’s elves went rogue and ruined Christmas for the whole world, his name would probably be Anthony Fauci.

Over the past year, the infectious disease “expert” has given so much garbage commentary wrapped up as “The Science,” it’s hard to keep track of exactly how many lies he’s told. Despite the long-term unknowns of giving low-risk children the Covid jab (and the shot’s potential side effects), for instance, Fauci has gone full steam ahead in pimping the mRNA injections for minors under 5, calling them “effective and safe.”

He also recently got busted in a legal deposition for previously flip-flopping on the efficacy of face masks in stopping viral transmission, as well as his prior work in smearing doctors who disagreed with his Covid approach.

Maybe if we’re lucky, Santa will mistake Tony for an elf and take him back to the North Pole.

2. Joe Biden

There’s really way too much you could say about Biden. Whether it’s the decimation of America’s energy industry, skyrocketing inflation, a wide-open southern border, or displaying weakness to our enemies, America’s commander-in-chief has done more to wreck the country in less than two years than Barack Obama did in eight. Even as the nation crumbles around his feet, Biden can’t be bothered to care, instead using the time he’s not napping to chow down on some ice cream.

Given Biden’s tendency to sniff children’s hair, you might want to check that the man coming down your chimney this Christmas Eve is in fact Santa and not the guy living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

3. Justin Trudeau

If there’s anyone who deserves coal in his stocking, it’s climate alarmist and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After forcing Canadian truckers to get the experimental Covid jab earlier this year, Trudeau not only smeared demonstrators protesting the mandate as racist, but he proceeded to use overreaching government powers to crush the protests.

Coupled with his climate war on Canadian farmers and support for Roe v. Wade, the young Fidel Castro look-alike definitely doesn’t deserve any presents under the tree.

4. Mitch McConnell

There’s probably no one more responsible for Democrats maintaining control of the Senate than GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. After trashing Republican candidates who wouldn’t support his bid for leadership, McConnell worked to undercut said candidates in the general election, pulling millions in ad spending from battlegrounds such as Arizona and redirecting it toward safe-Republican races such as Alaska to save establishment incumbents.

Additionally, McConnell did nothing to prevent his party from helping Senate Democrats advance numerous policy initiatives over the past year, such as gun control, deriding the meaning of marriage, and approving Biden’s judicial nominees.

5. Taylor Lorenz

Just as “democracy dies in darkness” at The Washington Post, so too does anonymity. In the spring, Post reporter Taylor Lorenz — a grown woman whose social media feed reads like that of a teenage girl’s — doxxed the woman behind the viral Libs of TikTok Twitter account.

In her bid to “expose” the person reposting publicly available TikTok videos of crazed leftist educators, Lorenz went out of her way to peddle antisemitic tropes by portraying the woman as a “powerful” Orthodox Jew who is helping “shap[e]” the media. Her article also linked to the woman’s real estate license, “including [her] name, real estate license number, and physical address.”

6. Merrick Garland

Once cast as a level-headed jurist by legacy media, Merrick Garland has done more to politicize the DOJ than any attorney general in modern American history. As if standing idle while left-wing anarchists harassed (and in one case, tried to assassinate) Supreme Court justices at their homes wasn’t bad enough, Garland’s DOJ orchestrated an unprecedented raid on the estate of a former president and current leader of the opposing political party.

Add in his habit of using the DOJ to issue politicized hot takes on Supreme Court decisions he disagrees with, and the only gift Garland should get this Christmas is a pink slip.

7. Rachel Levine

If you’re looking for last-minute gift ideas for your kids this year, I wouldn’t recommend asking Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine. Considering his advocation for laws that “support and empower” minors to “get gender affirmation treatment” (which is really just a euphemism for irreversible interventions such as mutilative surgeries), he’d probably tell you to get them puberty blockers or some other chemical that will destroy your children’s bodies.

8. Alejandro Mayorkas

If there were an award for “Worst Employee of the Year,” it’d go to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Over the past year, the guy has done virtually nothing to secure the U.S. southern border, leading to a record 2.3 million apprehensions during the 2022 fiscal year.

Despite his insistence that “the border is secure,” Mayorkas can’t hide the overwhelming chaos experienced by Border Patrol agents on a daily basis. In the spirit of Christmas giving, maybe Mayorkas should do the country a solid and give us his resignation.

9. Sam Bankman-Fried

Just in time for the holidays, it was revealed that Democrat mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange company, FTX, was essentially one giant Ponzi scheme. With FTX forced to declare bankruptcy, up to a million investors worldwide were left defrauded of billions of dollars.

I suppose nothing says, “Merry Christmas!” quite like scamming hundreds of thousands of people out of money.

10. Volodymyr Zelensky

It’s not every day a country gets invaded, but when it happens, you’d like to think the nation’s political leaders would prioritize the rights and well-being of their people. But Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken a different approach.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, Zelensky has used the war as a cover to target press freedoms, as well as disband an opposing political party. Instead of acting like the leader of a democracy, Zelensky has governed more like the man responsible for invading his nation: Vladimir Putin.

And while it’s understandable for Zelensky to seek assistance from the international community in Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty, it’s completely insane to use every available opportunity to try to drag the West into a nuclear-armed conflict with Russia that would lead to more destruction and loss of life.

GOP Can’t Be Successful Until Mitch McConnell Is Gone,"Comments Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made on Tuesday show why he has become the single biggest obstacle to GOP success.

The Kentucky Republican claimed giving more money to Ukraine is “the No. 1 priority for the United States right now, according to most Republicans.” The new $1.7 trillion Democrat spending bill he enthusiastically supports would give Ukraine another roughly $45 billion in assistance, bringing the total over the past eight months to more than $100 billion, a staggering figure even if it weren’t happening during a time of inflation, looming recession, and other serious domestic problems.

McConnell: ""Providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority for the United States right now according to most Republicans. That's how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment."" pic.twitter.com/NPmzWRzoz1 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 20, 2022

The comment about Republican priorities is so false as to be completely delusional. Among the many concerns Republican voters have with Washington, D.C., a failure to give even more money to Ukraine simply does not rank.

A large coalition of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the Conservative Partnership Institute, publicly opposed ramming through more Ukraine support during the lame-duck session before Republicans take over control of the House on Jan. 3, 2023. Strong pluralities and majorities of Republicans have told pollsters they want decreases, not increases, in foreign spending and global military involvement.

Many Republican voters support helping Ukraine fight Russia’s unjust invasion, but it is absolutely nowhere near their top issue, contrary to McConnell’s false claim. It ranked higher as a priority before American taxpayers gave Ukraine more than was given to their war effort by nearly every other country in the world combined. But even at the height of support for the effort, before it turned into a massive proxy war with an unclear relationship to the U.S. national interest, it was not the top issue for Republicans, coming behind the economy and the U.S. border.

A majority of Americans polled a few months ago said more money should be given to Ukraine only after wealthy European countries match what Americans have already sent — something nowhere near happening.

Republicans care deeply about borders and national sovereignty, but they rank the protection of their own open border far above the protection of the borders of other countries. It is worth remembering that the longest government shutdown in U.S. history occurred in 2019 over a fight between Congress and President Donald Trump over whether to commit a relatively paltry $5 billion to protect our country’s southern border, which Congress had refused to fund.

About that $1.7 Trillion Spending Package

Another comment from McConnell also shocked Republicans. Of the $1.7 trillion left-wing spending spree McConnell is working so hard to help Democrats pass, he said, unbelievably, that he was “pretty proud of the fact that with a Democratic president, Democratic House, and Democratic Senate, we were able to achieve through this omnibus spending bill essentially all of our priorities.” As an indication of how deeply sick and broken and unserious the Senate is, no one had even begun to read the lengthy bill, which was put forward just hours before votes began.

McConnell: ""I'm pretty proud of the fact that with a Democratic president, Democratic House, and Democratic Senate, we were able to achieve through this Omnibus spending bill essentially all of our priorities."" pic.twitter.com/RuVcsvNX0B — Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 20, 2022

The American people voted for Republicans to take over control of the House of Representatives, and House Republicans had begged McConnell to push for a smaller, short-term bill to keep the government funded while also giving them a rare opportunity to weigh in on Biden’s policy goals. McConnell allies dismissed House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and other House members who tried to persuade Republican senators not to support Democrats’ spending frenzy.

Budgets are policy documents, and the only leverage Republicans have is to wait a few weeks for when they will have a much stronger hand to weigh in on every issue that matters. By ramming through the $1.7 trillion package during the lame-duck session, Republicans will have significantly less ability over the next year to fight against Democrats’ destruction of rule of law in the Department of Justice, the failure to protect American borders, the destruction of the military, and Democrat collusion with Big Tech to suppress conservatives and their ideas.

The spending bill McConnell asserted was good for all of his priorities rewards the FBI with brand new headquarters and ups the funding for the DOJ to enable it to go after even more of its political opponents while protecting its political allies.

It’s perhaps worth remembering that during the 2020 Georgia runoff campaign, McConnell blocked efforts to increase funding for Americans who had their businesses and jobs shut down by government mandate during the response to Covid-19. Spending is not a problem for him, so long as the right people receive the funds.

Republicans Need a Leader Who Shares Their Goals

What support McConnell has from Republicans largely comes from doing his job well when it comes to judicial nominations. I myself co-wrote a book on the topic. He is rightly praised for his work in getting conservative judges and justices confirmed and for stopping one liberal judicial nominee, Merrick Garland. It is not praiseworthy, however, that he encouraged President Trump to nominate Garland as attorney general and voted to confirm him when President Biden did nominate him.

It is noteworthy that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has matched McConnell’s record on judges, and with far less fanfare from his allies. Perhaps Democrats demand more of their leaders than competence at only a few aspects of their job. That Schumer is capable of doing what McConnell has done shows it’s not a particularly unique skill set.

McConnell allies also like to say McConnell is good at stopping Democrat legislation. Indeed, McConnell did contribute to what few successes there were in the last two years, such as stopping the poorly named Equality Act. Certainly, he played small ball well enough to keep Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona from voting to get rid of the filibuster. Again, whatever frustration Republican voters have with McConnell should not keep them from acknowledging these limited successes.

However, Republican voters are desperately concerned about the country and are looking for bold and persuasive leadership instead of comfort with a few small, intermittent successes. They also seek leaders who don’t hate them. Frustration with McConnell’s well-known and long-established disdain for Republican voters is becoming a serious problem.

The politically toxic McConnell has continuously ranked as the country’s least popular politician, well behind Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. He is so disliked by Americans that he is underwater by an average of 35.3 points in polls gauging his favorability.

Unfortunately for Republicans, he has been the top elected Republican in the country for the last two years, a period marked mostly by inexcusable impotence, fecklessness, and muddled messaging from the GOP.

Rather than present a coherent and persuasive vision of what Republican control of the Senate might look like, or even demonstrating consistent opposition to Democrat policies, too often McConnell overtly or covertly helped Democrats pass their signature policy goals. He had his deputy Sen. John Cornyn negotiate a bill to restrict Second Amendment rights. He notoriously and embarrassingly caved on a promise to help Democrats get huge numbers to pass their CHIPS subsidy, giving Biden a huge win he could celebrate with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo two weeks before the midterm elections.

McConnell also famously trashed Republican candidates and the voters who selected them, refused to advocate strenuously for the candidates, and failed to develop or pursue a persuasive message to Americans for voting to give Republicans control of the Senate.

When Democrats poured $75 million — not even counting the outside spending — into defending Mark Kelly’s Senate seat in Arizona, McConnell left Republican challenger Blake Masters high and dry. Masters had only $9 million. Instead, McConnell interfered in Alaska’s Senate race even though the top two contenders were both Republican. He gave his valuable cash to weak Republican Lisa Murkowski, the candidate who did not even win the Alaska Republican Party’s endorsement! Murkowski is known for not voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, among other notable decisions.

After the disappointing midterm loss, McConnell blamed others. He also allowed a dozen Republican senators to vote for a bill that would enable assaults on Republican voters who, on religious grounds, oppose redefining marriage.

So long as Mitch McConnell is the top elected Republican in D.C., eagerly trashing Republican voters, vociferously advocating for Democrat policy goals, pushing $1.7 trillion Democrat spending packages, and weakly fighting for whatever Republican goals he can be bothered to pursue, Republicans have a major problem. This is beyond obvious.

Everyone outside D.C. knows this even if few inside D.C. are willing to acknowledge it. Until they do, the Republican Party will continue to suffer.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/21/gop-cant-be-successful-until-mitch-mcconnell-is-gone/,2022-12-21
Everything Wrong With Congress's Plan To Gift Zelensky Cash,"Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky is slated to receive a hero’s welcome in the U.S. capital today, just as Congress is poised to award him another $45 billion in its mammoth inflationary spending bill.

It may be Zelensky’s first time leaving Ukraine since the war with Russia began, but it’s not his first time appearing before an American audience to beg for more money. And it certainly won’t be his last. Already, Zelensky is prepared to use his congressional address to complain that the beaucoup bucks the U.S. has thrown at Ukraine in the last 10 months — more than $100 billion total if the omnibus passes — is still “not enough.”

Despite the financial strain Ukraine has put on the United States, the swamp is ready to welcome Zelensky with open arms. You wouldn’t know it from corporate media coverage, but that’s problematic. Here’s why.

Americans Simply Don’t Approve

Contrary to Mitch McConnell’s claims, spending taxpayer dollars on a proxy war in Eastern Europe is not high on the priority list for Republican or Democrat voters.

McConnell: ""Providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority for the United States right now according to most Republicans. That's how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment."" pic.twitter.com/NPmzWRzoz1 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 20, 2022

If Americans overwhelmingly reject going to war with Russia on behalf of Ukraine, which polling since the beginning of the conflict has said they do, Congress shouldn’t be spending money that indicates the U.S. is willing to prolong a war by whatever means necessary.

Throwing Dollars at Ukraine Escalates Rather than Ends the War

Nearly half of Americans want their government to urge Ukraine to negotiate a peace settlement. Instead of heeding the voters’ wishes, the Swamp extends Ukraine’s ability to fight with more funds, weapons, and verbal support. Money for Zelensky solidifies U.S. involvement in a war that Congress never voted to declare.

Cash for Ukraine Takes Away from Necessary U.S. Spending

While Congress funnels tens of billions of dollars to protect the border of a foreign country, our country’s border is virtually nonexistent. Each day, thousands of illegal border crossers pour into the southern United States.

These migrants put a physical and financial strain on our immigration system and cities all around the nation. Yet Congress, specifically Senate Republicans, repeatedly refuse to leverage their influence for funding to secure our border.

Senate Republicans could stop this by demanding border security before voting for the Biden ""omnibus."" Instead, they are voting for a budget that *prohibits* Border Patrol from securing the border! https://t.co/ugDlDxxLQz — Rep. Mary Miller (@RepMaryMiller) December 21, 2022

Funding an Overseas War When Americans Struggle to Afford Basics Is the Wrong Choice

While Congress ships taxpayer dollars overseas, Americans can’t afford to live in the increasingly expensive homeland.

As retirement accounts dip into the negative, 1 in 4 U.S. parents reports they couldn’t cover basic needs such as food, shelter, and care for their families in 2022. That’s no surprise considering raging inflation has jacked up prices across the board. Americans now pay 49.1 percent more for eggs, 27 percent more for butter, and 14.7 percent more for milk compared to 2021.

[RELATED: Grocery Shop With Me To Fact-Check Biden’s Inflation Up ‘Hardly At All’ Claim]

Zelensky’s Handout Is Part of a Destructive Spending Package

The more than $45 billion Congress designated for Zelensky is part of a sweeping, inflationary omnibus bill that would fulfill Democrats’ spending wishes before the newly elected Republican House is sworn in.

The legislation was conjured quickly with hardly any time slated for review or criticism. Because of that, Senate Republicans like McConnell face threats of gridlock from members of the new GOP House.

There Are Bigger Foreign Policy Problems Than Ukraine

As the world watches Ukraine and Russia duke (or possibly nuke) it out, China, our nation’s biggest threat, has been taking advantage of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Thanks to the laxity of the U.S., China crept its way into a working relationship with Russia and created a hegemonic plan to expand its rule. The communist regime’s boldness in expanding its Marxism and reaching for Taiwan will only grow stronger as America drains its foreign policy budget on Ukraine.

Ukraine Is Not a Top Strategic U.S. Security Interest

Not only is Ukraine not our biggest foreign policy problem, but it’s also not even a top strategic U.S. security interest. McConnell regularly justifies funneling dollars to Ukraine under the guise that the spending is part of “Essential Investments in American Strength and Security.” But the truth of the matter is that spending endless money on an indefinite war in Ukraine does nothing for Americans but create a national security threat.

The Biden Admin Is Incapable of Handling Problems Properly

Americans don’t trust Biden to handle the Russia-Ukraine war because every problem the Biden administration touches turns into an even bigger disaster.

Not only does the White House exacerbate crises, but it also creates them. Take one look at the economy, the southern border, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the political war waged by the Department of Justice and FBI against Americans, and you’ll understand why our president shouldn’t be so eager to be a cash cow for a foreign country.

Ukraine Isn’t the Most Honest Country

Zelensky’s Ukraine is filled with anti-democratic practices and principles: a war on the free press, money-grabbing bureaucrats, and a broken justice system.

Congress granting a corrupt regime funds with little to no oversight doesn’t just undermine war hawks’ reasoning for supporting Ukraine. It could also quickly result in a “Taliban inherits American weaponry” situation.

2022: A Crazy Year In 6 Minutes,"The huge changes to our country that seemed hard to believe were happening in 2021 have only worsened and become the new norm in 2022 — serious crimes get a free pass, millions of illegal immigrants flow across our borders, record national debt and inflation burn away our dollars, and censorship worsens.

This year also included Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, so add the threat of nuclear war to that list of the new awful.

The good news from this year is brief but heartening: Covid-19 seems mostly behind us, Roe v. Wade was overturned, and Elon Musk took ownership of Twitter and is exposing the Big Tech censorship so damaging to our democracy.

Abortion Ruling Brings Uglier Rhetoric — and Violence

Almost 50 years after the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, the ruling was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

In an unprecedented series of events, the court’s decision was leaked to the press, demonstrators protested outside justices’ homes, and an armed man was arrested near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s residence and charged with attempted murder. Pro-abortion zealots attacked dozens of life-saving pregnancy centers and churches. The FBI arrested a pro-life activist at his home.

Extreme Partisanship

The abortion issue exemplified today’s partisanship, but President Joe Biden used his office to further divide our nation, disparaging a huge number of Americans when he said in September: “The Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.”

This was following up on earlier comments that Trump’s philosophy is “semi-fascist.”

Biden Losing Command on World Stage

Biden also warned of “Armageddon.” On major international flashpoints, his administration walked back many of his panic-inducing comments. He said the U.S. would defend Taiwan should China invade, and that NATO would respond “in kind” to any Russian use of weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine. His handlers also walked back comments regarding sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and saying Putin “cannot remain.”

But when Biden tried to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for inflation too (we knew more than a year ago, before Russia’s invasion, that inflation was at a 40-year high), the White House didn’t walk that back. On the issue of the year that arguably affects Americans more than any other, their loss of income due to inflation, Biden repeatedly blamed Putin. If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.

Dissent Blocked by Big Tech

While Musk’s takeover of Twitter has revealed Big Tech’s suppression of free speech, many other events in 2022 highlighted ongoing threats to our First Amendment rights.

In February, podcaster Joe Rogan almost got canceled for using the “n-word” but also because he discusses ideas that corporate media consider untouchable, such as doubting Covid-19 vaccine efficacy. Since Rogan is not a conservative, a designation that makes people more subject to such cancellation, he brought national attention to how the left won’t tolerate dissent. In a compromise, Spotify deleted many of his past episodes.

The next month brought a major crackdown by Big Tech: Social media companies banned so-called “misgendering,” or accurately referring to people by their sex. Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk, The Federalist’s John Daniel Davidson, satire site The Babylon Bee, and others were blocked from Twitter.

That same month, YouTube removed a video of speeches by former President Trump and a U.S. senator at a major conservative conference, CPAC. YouTube representatives said the content violated their policy on misinformation regarding election integrity. Ironically, a topic of the conference was Big Tech censorship.

Information War Heats Up

Also in March, more than a year after Big Tech blocked the New York Post for publishing news of a laptop that detailed President Biden’s son Hunter’s cashing in on the family name with foreign business deals, The New York Times finally admitted the laptop was real and not Russian disinformation.

Then in May, the Biden administration launched a “Disinformation Governance Board” as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Following criticism, it was shut down.

However, DHS and the FBI continue monitoring social media for speech they consider dangerous and pressuring tech platforms to censor viewpoints that contradict the official narrative. Musk’s recently released “Twitter Files” have proven the government collaborated with tech giants to suppress free speech by censoring disfavored news stories and speakers, including using fabrications to block Trump’s account and coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop (Twitter said Trump violated its policy of inciting violence and the laptop went against its policy on publishing hacked materials, but staff acknowledged in internal deliberations that these were just excuses to do what they wanted).

Left Embraces LGBT Ideology, Some Resist

Along with Big Tech’s “misgendering” ban, this year saw the Biden administration push its radical leftist ideology even further.

It kicked off the year pushing for more insurers to cover transgender surgeries. It announced it would take lunches away from poor kids if schools did not accept the transgender agenda. Men were put in women’s prisons, and law enforcement was purged of those who disagree with radical trans ideology.

Disney was found to be “queering” its movies and shows, and parents started to push back. States passed legislation to keep sexual education from being taught too young or advocating transgender ideology, banning schools from keeping children’s sexual confusion from parents.

Some states passed laws to protect female athletes after transgender-identifying male Lia Thomas defeated female college swimmers.

Other Firsts in 2022

In other firsts, Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the first female, black Supreme Court justice. Showing how much transgender issues have come to dominate our debate, she was also the first Supreme Court nominee to be asked to define what a woman is.

Another unprecedented event that occurred in 2022 was the FBI searching Trump’s Florida home, Mar-a-Lago. The Department of Justice is once again targeting a political enemy in what will likely become a lengthy, drawn-out investigation.

Ending the year in a fitting tone, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested for allegedly defrauding investors of millions of dollars. He was the second-largest individual donor to the Democrat Party during the 2022 midterm election cycle, giving away about $40 million. FTX executive Ryan Salame gave about $20 million, mostly to Republicans.

Unfortunately, it’s unlikely 2023 will see Big Tech ending censorship, Biden finding his footing, or transgender radicalism fading away.

With the November elections behind us, we may feel incapable of changing any of these things, but sharing the truth is our greatest power — when Big Tech allows it.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/26/from-a-scotus-assassination-attempt-to-threat-of-nuclear-war-heres-2022-in-6-minutes/,2022-12-26
"After 10 Months Of War In Ukraine, Where Do We Go From Here?","It’s been 10 months since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the second phase of his invasion of Ukraine, aiming to dismantle its government and replace it with one of his liking while annexing large portions of Ukrainian territory. Instructively, Putin launched the first phase of his operations against Ukraine in 2014 when Joe Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president.

With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s recent address to a joint session of Congress and the Biden administration’s announcement of another $1.8 billion in military assistance, including the first-ever provision of a Patriot air defense battery, criticism of U.S. aid has been ramped up in some quarters, including among American conservatives.

To be clear, many of today’s critics were opposed to significant military assistance to Ukraine from the start. They warned that Russia might resort to nuclear weapons, that Russia would win anyway, that Russia’s core interests in Ukraine meant that they’d never give up the fight, that prior offers of potential Ukrainian accession to NATO meant that Russia had no choice but to preemptively invade, that Ukraine is corrupt with U.S. security aid somehow returning to America to line the pockets of corrupt politicians, that sending advanced weapons to Ukraine was escalatory and might widen the war, and that China is the main threat and any assistance to Ukraine is a zero-sum game that increases the risk in the Taiwan Strait.

Time has shown most of these concerns to be wrong or overblown, though the last matter, deterring China is far more complicated than one of simple weapons deliveries to Taiwan, given American deterrence is closely linked to credibility and a Russian victory in Ukraine would serve to encourage, not discourage, China.

Drawing on a career as an Army intelligence officer and service as young Reagan-appointed foreign affairs staffer in the Pentagon, I’ll first lay out some facts and then discuss current events and possible outcomes.

How Did We Get Here?

First, this war didn’t have to happen. It’s not a coincidence that both times Putin invaded Ukraine occurred when he perceived he was facing weak American administrations — Obama, and then Biden, fresh off the embarrassing debacle in Kabul. Were President Donald Trump reelected, Putin wouldn’t have rolled the iron dice.

Second, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman had a hand in Trump’s narrow defeat. Imagine the counterfactual in a world in which that U.S. Army officer combat veteran decided that the elected president of the United States had more authority to conduct foreign policy than he did on behalf of the amorphous unelected “U.S. national security interagency.” It was Vindman’s belief that the president was acting against the consensus opinion of the Executive Branch Trump himself led that caused Vindman to breach the classified contents of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky. This triggered a partisan impeachment vote in December 2019.

It bears noting that during the Cold War era, a Ukrainian-born naturalized citizen national security staffer would find their actions and advice carefully vetted for conflicts of interest. It pains to state it, but for Vindman’s vain second-guessing of the president, Putin wouldn’t have risked an invasion of Ukraine with Trump in office, sparing the lives of some 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. In Vindman’s case, be careful about what you wish for—Trump out of office—you might get it.

Lastly, we must deal with the world as it is and not as we wish it to be.

For whatever the rationale, Putin launched a massive offensive against Ukraine in February. Endlessly going over the why must not obstruct the present reality. Putin didn’t have to invade. He did. Deal with it and figure out how to best look after American interests.

The Ukrainian government, as is the case with most governments that arose from the rot of the Soviet Union, has struggled with corruption. Though an argument can be made that the searing experience of this war and the admirable response of Ukrainian civil society to it could give the Ukrainians a chance to enhance rule of law as they emerge from war. Even so, the vast majority of U.S. assistance to Ukraine has been in the form of weapons and ammunition, most of which is being backfilled right now — and most of which is made in America by American workers.

Context is Key

Since the start of the Biden administration, some $21.9 billion of military aid has been delivered. Going back to Russia’s first assault in 2014, the U.S. has provided about $24 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. By comparison, in 1973, as Israel was being attacked by Syria, Egypt, and others with support from the Soviet Union during the Yom Kippur War, President Richard Nixon provided $2.2 billion in military assistance. He did this by launching Operation Nickel Grass, a massive military airlift of arms and ammunition that, in today’s dollars, provided $15 billion of aid over a few weeks. Looked at another way, as a share of the U.S. economy then, that assistance today would be the equivalent of $36 billion of military hardware — 50 percent more to Israel in a few weeks than provided to Ukraine over eight years.

Of course, some of the discussion over aid to Ukraine has been confusing with Russia doing its part to sow distrust in already fertile fields. Aid amounts must first be appropriated by Congress and then are spent by the administration over time. Further, some 72 percent of U.S. assistance is in the form of military aid, not cash, with much of the funding taking five years to work its way through the defense procurement system.

And there is no scenario under which a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a positive for U.S. national security interests. Putin is an irredentist, pining to restore the past glory of the USSR or the Russian Empire before that. Ukraine was just his most ambitious project to date.

Where Do We Go From Here?

It’s clear Russia has lost the initiative and is struggling to keep an army in the field in the face of cold weather and constant Ukrainian attacks on the Russian logistics system. It’s hard to believe, but Russian soldiers have not been properly equipped for winter weather, aren’t getting enough calories, and aren’t being rotated off the front lines. Morale in the Russian ranks is terrible while both morale and confidence are high among the Ukrainians. Putin has bitten off more than he can chew, and he must be increasingly concerned about maintaining support at home and among his inner circle.

Lastly, due to decades of neglect, our ability to build the complex weapons systems required for modern, high-intensity war has atrophied and this is even more so for naval vessels. As a result, a $19 billion backlog of weapons intended for Taiwan has developed, reducing deterrents aimed at the Chinese Communist Party’s military ambitions to forcibly take Taiwan.

Here is where the Biden administration’s governance by autopilot and the permanent foreign policy establishment’s unimaginative Eurocentric groupthink combine for maximum danger. Ukraine is important and losing there will harm U.S. interests and embolden China. But Ukraine is an even bigger issue for Europe and the more America helps, the less the Europeans will, as has been the case in the past and is again now. (Trump had squeezed our NATO allies to pay their fair share of defense, but there’s a strong temptation to backslide under Biden.)

Navigating difficult tradeoffs while deterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan, Japan, India, and other nearby nations may be beyond the Biden team’s ability. Yet, as Americans, we must wish Biden success in this endeavor. Allowing Putin to win in Ukraine would be ten times worse than the loss in Afghanistan but China seizing Taiwan would be 100 times worse than that.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/27/after-10-months-of-war-in-ukraine-where-do-we-go-from-here/,2022-12-27
Zelensky’s PR Offensive Hits The DC Uniparty's Sweet Spot,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been repeatedly compared to Winston Churchill. The comedian-turned-politician is not the avatar of democracy that his legion of American admirers think he is, let alone this generation’s savior of Western civilization. But it’s doubtful that Churchill’s star addresses to joint sessions of Congress during the Second World War were received with any less adulation than Zelensky’s speech in the week before Christmas.

The question of whether it was appropriate for Zelensky to appear on the podium of the House in a variant of the GI Joe costume he’s been sporting on Zoom appearances throughout the year misses the point. He may have been the first foreign leader to behave this way since Palestinian Liberation Organization terrorist Yasser Arafat showed up in 1993 at the White House in a military uniform to sign a peace deal with Israel that he never intended to keep. But it was par for the course for a man who knows that his role is to play the hero at any and all times.

What was fascinating about the orgy of praise and support for the massive amount of U.S. aid heading to Kyiv is the way most of the Republican congressional leadership seemed just as eager to fawn at the Ukrainian leader as the Democrats.

Most Americans sympathize with opposing a blatantly illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the notion that “Providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority for the United States,” as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell put it, is quite another thing. The same can be said for doubling the amount of money the United States was spending on Afghanistan in its last years for this war’s first year.

Yet that is exactly what the governing class appears to be telling us. Few in either party treated the Russian seizure of Crimea and part of Eastern Ukraine in 2014 as an existential crisis, let alone the most important issue facing the country. A lot has changed since then.

Democrats, who have opposed almost every instance of American military involvement abroad since Korea, have finally found a war they can love. That’s largely because Ukraine — and Zelensky — played a central role in the Democrats’ first impeachment of former President Donald Trump.

The myth that Trump was blackmailing Ukraine became linked to the equally fallacious claim that he had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election. By the time Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the country had become a symbol of the struggle against both Putin and Trump as well as a principal focus of left-wing NGOs devoted to “human rights” that are, regardless of its often-undemocratic behavior, deeply committed to Zelensky’s government.

At the same time, Republican congressional leadership is engaging in some Cold War nostalgia by acting as if Russia poses the same threat to the West as Soviet Communism did.

Once Putin’s war began and Ukraine became a plucky underdog successfully resisting the aggression of its larger neighbor, it also became the darling of an uncritical media while the Washington uniparty circled the wagons around the idea that its security was somehow synonymous with the battle for democracy. Since then, any scrutiny of Ukraine, even if only to discuss what exactly American taxpayers are supporting, is treated as only something extremists care about.

Zelensky’s government is itself largely corrupt, connected to the same sort of wealthy oligarchs that dominate Russia’s kleptocratic economy. That government treats its opposition and critical press with the same disdain as Putin. Yet few in the corporate media are interested in discussing these realities. The same applies to Zelensky’s suppression of the Russian Orthodox Church.

During Zelensky’s Washington visit, anything other than obsequious adulation was considered inappropriate if not downright unpatriotic. Those who point out Zelensky’s flaws while acknowledging that Ukraine is the injured party have been called “isolationists,” accused of possessing “only the most desiccated character” or are just behaving like “jerks” choosing to be on the wrong side of history. And that just involves commentary from some conservative outlets.

Even if we acknowledge that the Ukrainians are the good guys, the idea that going all in on this war is the only way to save Europe from Russian domination is risible. That’s especially true now that the Russian military has been exposed as a shambles, Putin’s attempt to topple Zelensky failed, and the war has become a bloody stalemate. Yet McConnell and many in the GOP’s Senate and House caucuses as well as some conservative pundits speak as if it were 1987 and the forces of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact were still poised to race to the Rhine on Moscow’s orders.

That is why they are fully on board with Biden’s decision to grant Zelensky a blank check which, after the congressional passage of the scandalous $1.7 trillion spending bill, is sending more than $100 billion to Ukraine this year while America’s own neglected southern border is being erased by a massive surge in illegal immigration.

Nor is any member of the establishment pointing out that Zelensky’s vow to continue fighting until the unlikely event that a nuclear power is completely defeated and thrown back to the 2014 borders ensures an unwinnable war can go on indefinitely, something from which only the Ukrainian president stands to gain.

Zelensky’s Washington charm offensive succeeded because it hit the sweet spot of both variants of the DC uniparty. It appealed to both Democrats’ hostility to Putin and to a GOP establishment that still instinctually supports all foreign adventures that can be constructed as a defense of democracy or the West, whether or not those criteria actually apply.

In this manner, and regardless of its impact on readiness to deal with the far more important threat from China, enthusiasm for this proxy war with Russia has seized hold of the inside-the-beltway crowd. Democrats ascribe criticism of the frenzy over Zelensky as evidence of Putin’s influence while the GOP establishment dismisses it as something only isolationists ready to appease any dictator would say. Neither criticism is true.

It is possible to despise Putin and oppose his invasion and still see the $100 billion (and surely counting) being poured into Europe’s most corrupt nation as both excessive and unrelated to direct American national interests. It’s equally possible to support self-determination for Ukraine and admire its fight for survival while viewing the adulation for Zelensky as divorced from the reality of his rule. It’s also preventing Washington from telling him that his war goals are unrealistic and could set off a catastrophic wider conflict that should be avoided at all costs, and that a negotiated settlement of the war is necessary.

The war in Ukraine is a humanitarian catastrophe that should be ended as soon as possible, not prolonged indefinitely in the vain hope that it will somehow result in either regime change in Moscow or a total victory for Kyiv. What was drowned out in the rhetoric of Zelensky’s visit was not isolationism or sympathy for Russia but the imperative to hold a debate about how American security is advanced by continuing this war at such a high cost in the absence of a direct interest in whose flag should fly over the Donbas or Crimea.

Our Ukraine Obsession Is Hanging Taiwan Out To Dry,"It’s no secret the foreign policy of President Joe Biden has been a cataclysmic disaster. But a recent admission by his top diplomat shows anew just how inept his administration is on the world stage.

A few days before Christmas, Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a press conference to provide an overview of what the administration considered the “most consequential areas where diplomacy delivered in 2022.” Included on the list were U.S. actions such as rallying the world to support Ukraine, accelerating “strategic convergence” with allies to contain China, mobilizing “broad-based coalitions” to tackle global problems, and using American diplomacy to “advance peace and prevent and mitigate conflict.”

The more notable part of Blinken’s remarks, however, came during the question-and-answer portion of the press conference when the secretary was asked about lessons the administration learned from its 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. In his response, Blinken tacitly admitted that the administration is incapable of handling multiple foreign policy ventures at once.

“When it comes to Russia’s war against Ukraine, if we were still in Afghanistan, it would have, I think, made much more complicated the support that we’ve been able to give and that others have been able to give Ukraine to resist and push back against the Russian aggression,” he said.

Tony Blinken says the US wouldn’t be able to support Ukraine right now if they were still in Afghanistan and has no ability to support 2 allies at once



Taiwan can’t be happy to hear this pic.twitter.com/UXqwVtUFSb — Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) December 27, 2022

Taiwan in Focus

Whether intentional or not, Blinken’s statement doesn’t exactly promote confidence in American leadership — especially pertaining to Taiwan.

In recent years, the island nation has endured an uptick in aggression from China’s communist government, which views Taiwan as a Chinese territory led by Western-aligned separatists. Just this week, it was revealed Beijing had nearly doubled the number of times it sent military aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in 2022 (1,737) compared to the year prior (972).

Following a visit to Taiwan by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August, China has also begun normalizing military crossings of the median line in the Taiwan Strait. Developed during the Cold War, the imaginary line has acted as a buffer between Beijing and Taipei for decades.

In response to China’s growing hostilities, Taiwan has significantly increased its military readiness in preparation for a potential invasion. Last week, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen announced that starting in 2024, compulsory military service will be extended to one year from the current four-month requirement to “protect [Taiwan] and defend democracy.”

The move came several months after Taiwan’s government proposed a record 14 percent increase in defense spending.

Biden’s Ukraine Focus is Kneecapping Taiwan Support

While Biden has regularly approved arms sales to Taiwan as part of America’s commitment to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, his administration’s overzealous devotion to involvement in Ukraine is hampering U.S. commitments to the island nation.

Back in November, The Wall Street Journal published a bombshell report documenting a “nearly $19 billion backlog” of weaponry slated for Taiwan. In the report, U.S. officials expressed concern that the increasing number of weapons being shipped to Ukraine “is now running up against the longer-term demands” of America’s goal of arming the island to help “defend itself against a possible invasion by China.”

“The U.S. has pumped billions of dollars of weapons into Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February, taxing the capacity of the government and defense industry to keep up with a sudden demand to arm Kyiv in a conflict that isn’t expected to end soon,” the report reads.

Among the backlogged items are 208 Javelin antitank weapons, as well as 215 surface-to-air Stinger missiles. As of the report’s Nov. 27 publication, none of the weapon systems had been delivered to Taiwan.

Meanwhile, Biden recently signed a $1.7 trillion omnibus bill that includes $45 billion in aid to Ukraine. The allocation of funds comes in addition to the $68 billion already given to the Eastern European nation last year.

Taiwan Deserves Better than Biden

Despite his administration’s insistence that its commitment to Taiwan is “rock solid” in light of the Ukraine conflict, Biden, as it turns out, can’t walk and chew gum at the same time when it comes to managing multiple foreign affairs.

Whether the U.S. should be sending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars overseas is a separate conversation that certainly deserves to be had. But even if Americans did support such a policy, their leaders shouldn’t be prioritizing the second most corrupt country in Europe over one of the most successful democratic nations in East Asia.

Unfortunately for Taiwan, the failure to adequately fulfill America’s commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act is just one aspect of the chaos surrounding the Biden administration’s Taiwan policy. On several occasions, Biden has declared U.S. military support for Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, only for his White House handlers to walk back such statements hours later.

(For decades, the U.S. has practiced a policy of “strategic ambiguity,” wherein the decision to militarily defend Taiwan remains publicly unclear.)

Blinken’s remarks signal to Taiwan the reality millions of Americans have endured for years: Biden is an incompetent politician not cut out for international relations. Sadly, for Taiwan, such a fact comes at a time when the island needs strong American leadership the most.

2022 Was The Year Of Nationalist Strides In European Elections,"Europe’s dozens of peoples never vote entirely in lockstep. Mercifully, this does much to prevent Brussels globalist federalism from establishing hegemony. The year 2022 was no exception, though prevailing trends left more reason for optimism than did America’s November midterms. Nationalist candidates enjoyed success in several countries across the Old Continent in a year in which major players like Viktor Orbán and Emmanuel Macron were on the ballot. Even in countries in which the left gained or maintained power, nationalist candidates generally could point to important achievements.

This could portend the environment and voter attitudes of our next key electoral year of 2024. European and American voting patterns are often correlated; the 2016 dual shock of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump is the most famous recent example. In the short term, these electoral outcomes mean less opportunity for the European political class to offer undisguised transatlantic support to the Democratic Party.

These are an American observer’s key takeaways from a year in European elections.

Portugal

In this snap election triggered by a budget rejection, the Socialist Party unexpectedly won an absolute majority for only the second time in its history. As a result, it can govern without a coalition, and Prime Minister António Costa retains his position. Socialists now hold firm control of the Iberian Peninsula (Indeed, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was among those who celebrated the result). Smaller populist parties on the right did well, but a lack of collaboration with the center-right Social Democratic Party ensured a Socialist victory. The result represented a blow to the right on the western half of the continent.

Hungary

Arguably no one besides Donald Trump evokes the same degree of establishment hatred as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Thus, it was no surprise corporate media seized on a coalition of all major opposition parties and a fresh-faced opposition figurehead as they touted the possibility of Orbán’s ouster. The incumbent prime minister and frequent Brussels adversary responded by winning his most impressive victory yet.

Orbán’s Fidesz-KDNP alliance won a parliamentary supermajority with 135 of 199 seats and an outright majority of votes. Hungarians distrust key politicians on the left, desire stability and de-escalation on the country’s eastern border, and see EU strongarm measures as unreasonable; all of these factors worked in Orbán’s favor. The result was so emphatic that critics didn’t expend much energy in drumming up charges of malfeasance. For at least the next four years, traditional values and the interests of the nation-state will continue to have at least one significant advocate on the continent.

Serbia

Aleksandar Vučić, increasingly the subject of Brusselian indignation, led his big-tent ruling party to an easy victory with more than 60 percent of the vote. It comes at a particularly critical moment in the country’s history, as tensions are escalating in Kosovo (which Serbia claims as its sovereign territory) and Russia wages war in Ukraine.

Orthodox Serbia’s close relationship with Russia stretches at least two centuries, as any reader of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy can attest; the country did not enact sanctions against Russia this year. Bomb-ravaged buildings still stand in central Belgrade as a testament to the NATO aerial campaign from the 1990s. Serbia’s path to EU accession had seemed relatively straightforward, but the confident Vučić will have to lead his country through a turbulent period in which national wounds are resurfacing.

France

Michel Houellebecq’s 2015 novel “Submission” has proved a remarkably prescient commentary on French politics. Set in 2022, it imagines this exact presidential election. In the real-world version, a Muslim Brotherhood candidate did not burst onto the scene and lead the country dramatically into the Islamic world, but Emmanuel Macron does possess the youth, celebrity, and passion for the new world order of the fictional Mohammed Ben-Abbes. Houellebecq’s forecasted political collapse of the Socialist Party and the UMP/Republicans was already a reality by the previous national elections in 2017, and as in the novel, the Élysée Palace eluded nationalist Marine Le Pen.

Though some polls showed her statistically tied with Macron before the April 24 runoff, she never really threatened (she won 41.5 percent, compared to 33.9 percent in 2017). The internecine challenge from journalist Éric Zemmour, along with the retooling of the aforementioned Socialists and Republicans, suggests the nationalist camp would benefit from a new figurehead (27-year-old Jordan Bardella took charge of Le Pen’s National Rally in November).

Meanwhile, Macron will continue to carry the torch of post-Merkel European federalism. Le Pen and her colleagues have pioneered new possibilities in European politics, but actual power in Paris remains firmly in establishment hands.

Slovenia

Populist Prime Minister Janez Janša, an ally of both Trump and Orbán, unexpectedly lost his reelection bid. Incoming Prime Minister Robert Golob ran on a platform of orientation toward Western Europe and left-wing social policies. Just three months after the election, the new government embraced measures to redefine marriage. The result ensures one less committed nationalist and a currently atypical left-wing regime in the formerly communist half of the continent.

Sweden

The nationalist Sweden Democrats shocked the establishment by winning 20 percent of the vote in what was a rebuke to the long-dominant Social Democrats. Voters ostensibly grew tired of skyrocketing crime and unrestrained immigration, and even the left-wing parties felt compelled to discuss these issues during the campaign.

The Sweden Democrats, once shunned by the leading political parties, will remain outside the new ruling coalition but will significantly influence its policies, particularly those related to migration and law and order. The election outcome represents arguably the most emphatic victory for the right in Sweden’s political history.

Italy

Just two weeks after the right’s triumph in Sweden, Italy became the most populous EU member to elect a right-wing government in recent years. The personable Giorgia Meloni announced herself on the European political stage with her victory. Joining her ruling coalition is the populist Matteo Salvini, a leading mass-immigration critic who previously served as deputy prime minister, and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Meloni quickly made good on campaign promises by refusing to let a migrant NGO ship dock in an Italian port in October. As a meaningful right-wing victory still seems out of reach in European giants like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, Meloni’s Italy can establish the blueprint for governance in European power.

Denmark

The left-wing Social Democrats, already the largest party in parliament, won their highest vote total in two decades, keeping Mette Frederiksen in the role of prime minister. A breakup of the once-significant Danish People’s Party led to a splintering of the nationalist vote in a country that has been relatively strict on immigration by West European standards and has already adopted many of the populists’ policies on that issue. Collaboration of the three largest parties in a novel grand coalition will keep the establishment firmly in control and create a very different political atmosphere from the one across the Øresund in Sweden.

United Kingdom

The United Kingdom did not hold a general election in 2022, but its recent leadership debacle deserves a word. Boris Johnson resigned after numerous scandals in his government. His Conservative Party elevated Liz Truss to the leadership position; just 44 days later, it undertook the same exercise and settled on Rishi Sunak. As long as the Labour Party embraces extreme leftism, the artist formerly known as the Conservative Party will likely remain in power on the electable center-left establishment ground. It will have perhaps two full years (the next general election will occur no later than January 2025) to heal its recent self-inflicted wounds.

Late 2023 will bring a slew of important elections on the continent. Unpredictable, fiercely independent Switzerland will hold federal elections in October. Poland, currently governed by a right-wing government that has restored at least some of its popularity since the war in Ukraine began, will hold parliamentary elections in November. Spain, currently featuring a socialist government, will be the largest country to hold a general election when it votes in December.

With a war in Ukraine, ongoing energy crises, and voters frustrated by years of Covid restrictions, European politics promises not to become dull anytime soon. Americans eager to gain insights about the 2024 election environment should closely follow events across the Atlantic.

"Here's Why Hunter Biden Story Is Worth Investigating, Chuck Todd","This weekend, NBC’s Chuck Todd and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson had a tense exchange over the importance of the Hunter Biden story. After whatabouting the issue for a bit, an agitated Todd asked: “Senator, do you have a crime that you think Hunter Biden committed? Because I’ve yet to see anybody explain. It is not a crime to make money off of your last name.”

There can’t be an investigation until we know for certain that something criminal occurred, but we can’t know if anything criminal occurred until there’s an investigation. Convenient. This, of course, is not the standard journalists have ever embraced for scrutinizing presidential wrongdoing in the past. Todd regularly entertained notions about Donald Trump’s alleged seditious conspiracy in 2016 — which would have been the most diabolical political crime in American history — without any tangible evidence of criminality.

Also, not inconsequentially, Hunter is already under criminal investigation for tax and gun charges by federal prosecutors in Delaware. So, surely, the case has hit the threshold of a criminal investigation. Does Todd not know about this?

That said, a president doesn’t necessarily have to break a specific criminal code to be corrupt. And this scandal isn’t about Biden’s son or his brother, but about Joe. At worst, Biden benefitted and participated in the family influence peddling, or, at best, he spent years lying to the American public about his knowledge of that business. Even if we found pictures of Trump and Putin taking shots of Imperia vodka together to celebrate the defeat of American democracy, it still wouldn’t change the fact Biden has much to answer for.

Recall that in an interview with Axios, Biden claimed he knew absolutely nothing about what Hunter was doing with Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that was paying the younger Biden $50,000 monthly. Joe said he trusted Hunter, who had accepted a no-show job while his father was overseeing the Obama administration’s policy in Ukraine. That firm was led by an oligarch who at the time was under investigation for corruption.

Joe Biden claims that as vice president, he threatened Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko with the withdrawal of United States aid if he didn’t fire state prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma at the time. That, at the very least, was a serious conflict of interest. In 2015, some Obama administration officials — not exactly right-wing conspiracy theorists — raised concerns about the Bidens and Ukraine.

Because of the New York Post’s investigation into Hunter’s laptop — a story ignored by the Chuck Todds of the world for transparently partisan reasons — we also learned that an executive from Burisma thanked Hunter for facilitating a meeting between him and Joe while the latter was still vice president. This week, The New York Times gingerly confirmed that Biden had, indeed, met with Burisma reps. We also know that Hunter’s business partner made at least 19 visits to the Obama White House. We know that former Hunter associate Tony Bobulinski has sworn that Joe Biden discussed the family business. Emails suggest that Biden was the recipient of 10 percent in all those deals. I suspect if this was about Donald Trump, Chuck Todd would care more?

None of this even gets into the fact that Hunter’s associates allegedly facilitated a meeting between then-Vice President Biden and Chinese Communist Party members and billionaires in Beijing. Or that Hunter’s emails claim that You-Know-Who got a 10 percent share in a deal Hunter struck with a Chinese energy firm.

Todd, incidentally, decried the “political” nature of the Hunter investigation in an interview with incoming House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer last week. Of course there’s a political motivation here. Every investigation into Trump had a political motivation, as well. Virtually every congressional investigation in history, to some extent, is politically motivated. This is how the American government works. One side keeps the other honest. That alone doesn’t make the underlying claims untrue. Remember, Hillary Clinton’s illegal server and influence peddling were ferreted out in the Benghazi investigation — which, unsurprisingly, Todd also claimed was propelled by “conspiracy theory.”

It’s not the partisan incentive that made the Russia collusion narrative a hoax, it was the complete lack of merit and evidence. Republicans would be wise not to obsess over Hunter Biden, but they already have far more genuine evidence to justify a House investigation.

Now, I’m not certain if taking a cut from the family racket is technically a criminal offense, but it’s most definitely a worthwhile story. Maybe Joe Biden, noted civil rights activist and college football star, merely lied to distance himself from his son, or maybe not. How will we ever know? Republicans can’t rely on the political media to do its job. Todd, Jake Tapper, Joe Scarborough, and many others don’t merely dismiss inconvenient stories as unworthy of their attention, they act like members of the Biden Praetorian Guard.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/16/heres-why-the-hunter-biden-corruption-story-is-worth-investigating-chuck-todd/,2023-01-16
9 Questions Biden Should Answer About His Documents Scandal,"On day one of President Joe Biden’s presidency, the White House pledged to “bring transparency and truth back to government.”

Days into Biden’s latest scandal involving multiple discoveries of several classified documents from his years as vice president in his office, home, and garage, it’s more clear than ever that the Biden administration has no intentions of transparency when it comes to this issue.

So far, corporate media coverage of the sensitive materials has largely centered on any details that can be manipulated to distance Biden’s scandal from the classified documents dispute that prompted the Biden FBI to raid former President Donald Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago (no such raid has been executed at any of the locations where Biden stashed documents). While media run cover for Biden — and their own double standard — there are still at least nine important and outstanding questions that the White House should but likely won’t answer about “garage gate.”

1. Why Were the Documents in Biden’s Possession?

The White House claims Biden didn’t know about the documents and was “surprised” they were found in his office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C.

“I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office. But I don’t know what’s in the documents. My lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were,” Biden said at the North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico.

House Intelligence Committee members, however, reject that claim.

“For those who think that well, the president didn’t realize that he had those in his possession. It just is nonsense. Of course he knew that he had them. They’re so obvious,” Republican Rep. Chris Stewart said on “Face The Nation.”

2. Why Were Biden’s Lawyers Poking Around?

The official reasoning given to justify Biden’s lawyers’ snooping was that the legal team was “closing out” his Penn Biden Center office in Washington D.C. and stumbled across the documents. Reports suggest the first batch of classified materials was discovered in a manila folder labeled “personal.”

That discovery reportedly prompted the Democrat’s lawyers to extend their search and review, which is how they found other records in Biden’s Delaware garage near his Corvette and in his home.

It’s still unclear why Biden’s personal attorneys were tasked with clearing out his old office in the first place.

3. Why Did Biden’s Lawyers, the DOJ, and the National Archives Keep the Documents Quiet for Months?

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the National Archives and Department of Justice were notified “the minute that his lawyers found those documents,” but the same can’t be said for the public.

Biden’s lawyers found the documents in his Penn office mere days before the 2022 midterm elections. They uncovered more records in his home in December. News about the discoveries, however, didn’t come until early January.

Why did the Biden administration, DOJ, and National Archives choose to hide that information from Americans until now? Did some of Biden’s allies in the press know about the documents and choose to keep them quiet? Did delaying news about Biden’s potential crime affect the election like the subversion of material from his son’s laptop did?

4. Did the White House Ask the DOJ to Delay Involvement in Investigation?

A new Wall Street Journal report seems to suggest so. According to the article published on Jan. 17, Biden’s legal team struck a deal with the DOJ to keep the FBI, which eagerly facilitated a raid on Trump’s home, away from the search for more material.

“Instead, the two sides agreed that Mr. Biden’s personal attorneys would inspect the homes, notify the Justice Department as soon as they identified any other potentially classified records, and arrange for law-enforcement authorities to take them,” the article reported.

5. Did Biden’s Lawyers Sift Through Docs Before Handing Them Over to Archives?

Because the DOJ granted Biden’s legal team the luxury of sifting through the confidential records without surveillance or oversight, there’s no way for the public to know if Biden’s legal team vetted, removed, or tampered with the materials before handing them over.

Early reports suggested the files recovered from the Biden Center include “US intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom.”

Considering Biden’s history of leading the White House’s relations with Ukraine as VP and his son’s history of profiting off of a Ukrainian energy company during that same time, documents with sensitive information about Ukraine could be useful for congressional Republicans investigating Biden family corruption.

6. Will the Special Counsel Execute the Probe Without Political Bias?

Attorney General Merrick Garland eventually hand-picked special counsel Robert Hur to oversee the probe into Biden’s sensitive records but there’s no guarantee the special counsel will divert from the DOJ’s politicized agenda.

As a matter of fact, Hur was involved in the FBI’s communications with Russia collusion hoaxer No. 1 Christopher Steele. Hur was also a member of the DOJ team that tried to subvert a congressional exposé of the intelligence community’s failures during that same collusion hoax.

7. Who Had Access to the Sensitive Materials?

Despite claims from Biden, the White House, and the corporate media that the classified materials were securely stored, it’s clear that foot-trafficked areas such as a “locked” garage next to a car, a house that is occupied frequently by the president, and a closet in a busy office building are no place for sensitive documents.

Who all had access to these locations?

Well, we know that Hunter Biden, the president’s scandal-plagued son, lived in his parents’ Delaware home where the sensitive documents were stored for years. He even lied at one point that he owned the property.

As for anyone else, the Secret Service denies keeping a record of any comings and goings around Biden’s house. The White House previously alluded to the existence of visitor logs but now claims they never existed.

8. What’s in the Classified Documents?

Perhaps the most pressing and important question about Biden’s classified documents is what do they contain? In the wise words of Federalist Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway: “we don’t know what we don’t know.”

Do the files actually hold sensitive Obama-era information about Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom, as reports suggest? If so, that makes the $51 million the University of Pennsylvania received from foreign, anonymous donors since Biden’s inauguration look extra suspicious. Especially since the bulk of those donations originated from China, one of the Biden family’s foreign entanglements, but won’t be publicly identified because the Biden administration no longer requires U.S. universities to disclose that funding to Americans.

9. Why Is the Biden Administration Scrambling?

The corporate media is clearly on Biden’s side so why can’t his administration pull itself together enough to give direct answers to questions that badly need answering?

Releasing statements that are “incomplete at best, misleading at worst” or mumbling excuses about Corvettes and locked closets does nothing but deepen Americans’ distrust in the incompetent administration in charge of handling this mess.

After days of running cover for the president, some corporate media mouthpieces are now willing to admit that the Biden administration’s scrambling looks like a coverup of something bigger.

“It looks like they were trying to kind of hide that and cover that up until after the midterms,” Matt Lewis, senior columnist for The Daily Beast, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

A Disaster Per Month: The Worst Failures Of Biden's Second Year,"The first year of Joe Biden’s presidency prolifically delivered examples of corruption and incompetence, and his second year in office — which drew to a close on Thursday — has been no different.

Last year, The Federalist collected “A Scandal For Every Month: The Biggest Botches, Failures, And Mess-Ups Of Joe Biden’s First 12 Months In Office.” At the end of that piece, I expressed hope that 2022 would see fewer disasters flow from the White House. Unfortunately for the country, the roundup from year No. 2 is just as grim.

January: Biden Compared Filibuster Defenders to Historical Racists

Last year’s list concluded with a bonus item for January 2022: Biden comparing his agenda’s critics — which include Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace and Confederate leader Jefferson Davis.

In a Jan. 11 speech urging the U.S. Senate to ditch filibuster rules in order to pass his radical and unconstitutional federalization of election laws, Biden asked, “Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?”

February: Incompetent Response to Russia-Ukraine War

Before, during, and since Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in February, the Biden administration’s response has been marked by incompetence. Biden waived sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline before the war in 2021, crippled American energy production, and turned to Russian ally Venezuela for oil after the conflict erupted. In January 2022, right before Russia’s invasion, Biden signaled a green light to Russian President Vladimir Putin, responding to a question about potential plans to impose sanctions on Russia with the comments, “It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion [into Ukraine],” and “My guess is [Putin] will move in. He has to do something.”

“Are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?” a reporter asked. Biden’s answer: “That’s how it did sound like, didn’t it?”

A month into the Russia-Ukraine war, Biden recklessly called for regime change in Russia, before reversing course and insisting he did no such thing. By November 2022, the United States had shipped out a whopping $68 billion in aid to Ukraine, with Biden requesting another $37.7 billion to put total aid in the 12-figure range.

March: Hunter Biden Corruption Scandal Resurfaces as NYT Admits Laptop’s Legitimacy

Eighteen months after the New York Post reported on a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden that contained incriminating emails about his shady foreign business deals — a bombshell that was censored in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election — The New York Times finally, quietly admitted in March that the laptop was legitimate. As The Federalist’s Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland noted at the time, conceding the laptop’s authenticity also meant conceding that the numerous scandals contained in the laptop’s trove of documents were real.

Those scandals include an apparent pay-to-play in Ukraine, where Hunter was receiving $50,000 a month to sit on the board of corrupt energy company Burisma while his VP dad oversaw American foreign policy toward the country. During that time, Joe Biden leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure the firing of the state prosecutor who was investigating Burisma. Hunter Biden’s scandalous transactions also indicate a deal with a Chinese company in which 10 percent was “held by H for the big guy,” presumed to be Joe Biden.

April: Biden Admin Debuts Thought Police Board

In a congressional hearing on April 27, Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the creation of a “Disinformation Governance Board” to crack down on the “threat” (his word) of speech that challenges the Biden administration’s narrative on social media. The administration tapped Hunter Biden laptop truther, Christopher Steele fangirl, and censorship aficionado Nina Jankowicz to helm the project, before “pausing” the project after three weeks of outrage. Make no mistake, though — DHS assures us it’s still “continuing” to “address” speech it doesn’t like.

May: White House ‘Encourages’ Intimidation of SCOTUS Justices

After a leaker funneled a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade to Politico in early May, furious abortion supporters swarmed the private homes of the Republican-appointed justices. One left-wing group offered money to activists in return for descending on justices’ residences, even publishing their alleged addresses online. When asked about the intimidation tactics levied against the court, then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn the demonstrations, telling reporters that the Biden administration “certainly continue[s] to encourage that outside of judges’ homes.”

In June, the threats culminated in an assassination attempt on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s life, when a California man was arrested near Kavanaugh’s home with “a Glock handgun, ammunition, a knife, pepper spray, and various tools for forced entry.”

June: Gas Prices Surpass $5 in Record High

After the Biden administration cracked down on domestic gas production, canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, and spurred nationwide inflation, gas prices climbed. June saw several regrettable milestones.

On June 3, The Federalist recorded that the country had seen 18 records for high gas prices in just 19 days. On June 6, gas prices officially doubled what they were when Biden took office. On June 11, the national average price of a gallon of gas hit $5.00 for the first time ever. On June 14, the price of gas hit its all-time high of $5.016, and on June 19, diesel topped the charts at $5.816.

July: The Joe Biden Recession Becomes Official

As rampant inflation continued to reach and break 40-year records — exacerbated by packages dumping trillions of dollars into the economy under Biden’s watch, while the president touted his “transition” of the economy to a green pipe dream — the nation officially hit the criteria for a recession at the end of July. Gross domestic product fell by 0.9 percent in 2022’s second quarter, hitting the benchmark of back-to-back quarters of negative growth that has traditionally signaled recession.

As Federalist CEO Sean Davis noted at the time, “Private investment dropped by double digits, its worst showing since the COVID shutdown,” while “disposable personal income has now fallen for five straight quarters.”

August: Biden’s FBI Raids a Former President

Under the leadership of partisan Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Biden administration’s FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on Biden’s predecessor, 2020 presidential opponent, and potential 2024 rival Donald Trump. The stated reason for the raid was a documents dispute with the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act — but executive branch staffers and appointees (who, unlike the president, don’t have the power to declassify documents) have mishandled memos before and received wrist slaps.

The politicized nature of the raid — and of the DOJ’s attempt to turn the documents dispute into a scandal ahead of Trump’s candidacy in the 2024 election — became even more obvious after President Biden was discovered to have withheld multiple troves of classified documents from his time as vice president in multiple locations, including his garage. His own DOJ’s deference to Biden’s lawyers in that documents scandal makes their hubbub over the Trump case all the more absurd.

September: Biden’s FBI Raids Pro-Life Dad

Discontent to stop at Biden’s predecessor, the FBI executed a raid on pro-life Catholic and father of seven Mark Houck the following month. Houck’s wife described north of 20 agents with more than a dozen vehicles descending on their family home, with “big, huge rifles pointed at Mark and pointed at me and kind of pointed throughout the house,” before dragging Mark away.

What was his crime? The Justice Department accused Houck of “attacking a patient escort” at a Planned Parenthood facility, but Mark’s wife says he simply pushed away a pro-abortion man who was verbally and physically antagonizing Mark’s 12-year-old son. The man had previously had a lawsuit against Mark thrown out of district court, but the DOJ picked it up in its war on pro-life demonstrators post-Dobbs. By October, the DOJ had announced indictments of 22 pro-lifers.

October: Illegal Immigration Closes Worst Fiscal Year in History

The year 2022 was full of new records for out-of-control illegal immigration under Biden’s watch, but by the time the fiscal year closed out and the 2023 fiscal year started in October, migrant apprehensions had smashed the previous annual record. In FY 2022, Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.4 million apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the southern border, compared to 1.7 million in 2021 and not even 460,000 in 2020. The totals for every month but July and August eclipsed previous years (totals for July and August 2021, also under the Biden administration, were higher than in 2022). May of 2022 saw the highest monthly number of migrant encounters ever recorded.

November: Biden Buys Votes with Unconstitutional Student Loan Bailout

Biden’s plan to put taxpayers on the hook for roughly $300 billion to cover student loan debts for affluent college graduates found itself smacked down by the judiciary several times in November — but not before the president had used the illegal scheme to win over young voters for his political allies in the midterm election. Announced in August, the plan constituted an unconstitutional usurpation of the legislative branch’s authority to expend government (i.e., taxpayer) funds.

A survey from Intelligent in the summer of 2022 found that 23 percent of voters said they wouldn’t vote for Biden in 2024 unless he made “some or all” student loan debt disappear. The ploy did what it was designed to do in November, with Gen Z and millennials turning out in high numbers for Democrats.

December: ‘Twitter Files’ Show Biden Asked Big Tech for Censorship

A cache of internal Twitter documents revealed in December showed the Biden administration had pressured Twitter to censor and “de-platform” accounts that challenged the regime’s narrative about Covid shots. Other “Twitter Files” released the same month revealed that even before Biden won the White House, his campaign team was sending similar censorship requests to the Big Tech company, this time about embarrassing images of his scandal-embroiled son, Hunter.

The Biden team’s penchant for colluding with Big Tech to censor unflattering information or dissenting opinions is consistent with the administration’s 2021 admission that it was “flagging” social media posts it deemed “misinformation” for its allies at Facebook.

"$113 Billion Later, NYT Admits Ukraine Is Broken And Corrupt","Image Credit /Public domain Rawpixel /Public domain

It’s apparently safe now to make the obvious point that Ukraine is run by fiends and so maybe dumping American taxpayer dollars on the corrupt little nation without any strings attached was a little hasty.

Maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves, but The New York Times on Tuesday did take time to report the slew of firings and forced resignations of top Ukrainian government officials, a push by President Volodymyr Zelensky(yyy), for the purpose of “reassuring Ukraine’s allies — which are sending billions of dollars in military aid — that his government would show zero tolerance for graft…”

Well, that was kind of him. Maybe now Democrats and even idiot Republicans will stop countering every question about our involvement with Ukraine by declaring their critics to be Pervs for Putin.

The war-loving romantics of Congress haven’t seen a dollar they wouldn’t like to send to Ukraine, even as it’s been rated by foreign aid nonprofits and humanitarian organizations as one of Europe’s most crooked countries for years, over and over.

The firings and resignations substantively mean very little. Zelensky’s administration released no explanation for them, nor are there any official details about specific evidence of corruption, other than that one of Zelensky’s deputies rode around town in a General Motors-donated SUV that was supposed to be for “humanitarian missions” (rather than, say, for attending a Vogue cover photoshoot). There’s also something about using government funds — that is to say, U.S. taxpayer dollars — to buy eggs at an inflated price, raising the grave question: Why were they shopping for eggs in America?

Over the course of nearly a year, the U.S. has spent $113 billion on Ukraine and counting. Every step of the way, anyone with a question about why or for whom or to what end has been shouted down as a Putin sympathizer or dismissed as anti-democracy. And then Zelensky shows up to tell us we’re not doing enough.

At least the Times has come around to acknowledging that Ukraine isn’t the squeaky clean operation that the White House, most of Congress, and all of the corporate media insist that it is. Maybe next we’ll be allowed to openly state that Ukraine and NATO were antagonizers of this war, and funding it indefinitely is probably doing more harm than good.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/24/a-day-late-and-113-billion-short-new-york-times-acknowledges-ukraine-as-a-broken-and-corrupt-nation/,2023-01-24
Biden A National Security Threat Long Before Documents Fiasco,"Long before classified and potentially compromising documents were discovered in President Joe Biden’s “think tank” office and Wilmington home and garage, the Democrat’s actions posed a threat to U.S. national security.

The discovery of even more top secret documents dating back to Biden’s time as vice president and senator sparked widespread concerns that the current president hid material that put U.S. national security at risk, potentially for decades.

Republicans worried — and even partisan hacks such as Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff conceded — that Biden’s harboring of classified documents in high-traffic, unsecured areas could have put Americans or the U.S. government at risk.

“Is it possible that national security was jeopardized here as many, including you, raised that possibility with the Mar-a-Lago documents?” ABC’s “This Week” co-anchor Jonathan Karl asked.

“I don’t think we can exclude the possibility without knowing more of the facts,” the disgraced former chair of the House Intelligence Committee replied.

It seems logical to investigate Biden’s recent scandal to ensure he didn’t compromise any sensitive material. But the truth is, he opened up the U.S. to a myriad of national security crises, abuses, and disasters long before news broke of his document scandal.

Since taking office, Biden, who is charged with ensuring the national security of the U.S., has put Americans and their security at risk countless times.

By openly pursuing a policy of escalation in the U.S.-funded proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, Biden and his administration have significantly increased the threat of nuclear war. A conflict that only ends on Ukraine’s terms and might result in a radioactive third world war compromises Americans’ safety and tax dollars.

It also leaves countries like Taiwan vulnerable to communist China’s hegemonic operations. While China stockpiled hundreds of nuclear warheads and prepared to expand its influence, Biden was further emboldening his country’s No. 1 foreign threat. First, he did business with the Chinese gas giant with ties to his son. Then Biden pushed the Saudis into an amicable relationship with the Eastern communist government.

Speaking of the Middle East, it was Biden’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal that sent tens of thousands of Afghan refugees into U.S. cities without proper screening, vetting, and inspection. This lapse in security resulted in two known security risks and dozens more evacuees tainted by “derogatory information” entering the country unmonitored.

Domestically, Biden and the same agency that failed to vet Afghan refugees jeopardized U.S. national security by escorting in the worst illegal immigration influx in recorded U.S. history and then doing nothing to fix it. Under Biden’s watch, more than 100 potential terrorists and hundreds more criminals crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

Even dating back to his time as vice president, Biden sacrificed national security for profit by keeping his son Hunter Biden close. Hunter didn’t just exchange access to his father for cash to fund the family’s lavish lifestyle, he was paid by oligarchs and businessmen in countries that have a vested interest in meddling with U.S. affairs.

That’s likely why the inexperienced Hunter was handed a lucrative position at a prominent Ukrainian energy company at the same time his father took the lead on Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

At one point, Biden used a non-government email to share official White House business with Hunter, a civilian who shouldn’t have had access to sensitive material. Republican senators’ attempts to investigate the emails and the role they may have played in enriching the Biden family business were ignored.

Biden’s willingness to share delicate information with his son, whose own documents stored on an abandoned laptop likely pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States, is more than problematic. Combine that with Biden’s knowledge of and involvement in Hunter’s business with foreign oligarchs, and you have a long list of foreign entanglements and finances that could severely hamper the elder Biden’s ability to put American interests first.

If early reports are correct in noting that some of the recovered Biden documents included “US intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom,” Biden’s information cache does warrant investigation and transparency. But don’t be fooled into thinking this is the first time Biden has sacrificed U.S. national security to protect his personal interests, preserve the Biden family business, and advance his radical agenda.

Every Dollar We Toss Ukraine Zaps Resources From Our Military,"Earlier this week, The New York Times reported on the Ukrainian government’s recent shake-up to fight corruption. “The dismissals appeared to reflect Mr. Zelensky’s goal of reassuring Ukraine’s allies — which are sending billions of dollars in military aid — that his government would show zero tolerance for graft as it prepares for a possible new offensive by Moscow,” according to the Times. Why did it take Volodymyr Zelensky 11 months to address the corruption issue? There have been signs of the problem for many months now.

Ukrainian-born Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., who at the beginning of the invasion was very supportive of Ukraine, more recently began to question Zelensky’s administration. Spartz wanted to have greater oversight on American aid to Ukraine, for which she was criticized by many in both parties.

With the recent removal of several officials, it appears there were grounds for questioning where the funds were being spent in Ukraine. The United States has been by far the largest supporter of military aid to that country, despite the European Union having similar GDP and 100 million more in population. Military equipment is the most important aid to keeping Ukraine’s military armed and fighting, which might be why Zelensky is trying to address corruption now.

With Republicans having control of the House of Representatives, several Republicans want greater oversight of the money being sent to Ukraine. It is unfortunate that it took a change in House leadership to make sure American taxpayer money is being spent properly overseas.

U.S. Military Production at Risk

The state of U.S. military production was another news story that broke this month — and this story should be more concerning to the American public than Ukraine’s problems. The Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank released a report on the U.S. defense industry and military aid to Ukraine. The report found that the United States’ “defense industrial base is not adequately prepared for the competitive security environment that now exists.” The United States is ranked third in casting production, which is necessary for creating weapon systems, and the lag time for the production of most weapons is more than a year.

CSIS believes the United States would run out of precision missiles and other advanced technology in less than a week in a Taiwan Strait conflict. If that were to happen, the United States would have to resort to more crude weapon types, just as Russia has resorted to in Ukraine. The 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that the United States sent to Ukraine could be replaced in about three years depending on the production surge rate. HIMARS have been very effective in Ukraine, but this highlights the continued danger of the United States’ ability to produce weapon systems. If America needs many of these weapon systems in short order, it appears the capability is not there to produce them.

A Depleted Military Can’t Overcommit

This is not a debate about aid to Ukraine but rather a debate on U.S. military production capabilities. The war in Ukraine should be viewed as a sideshow for the United States by capability alone. More than $100 billion in aid has been sent to Ukraine. This is not a small amount, but with a defense budget of more than $700 billion annually, the Ukraine war should not be straining our military. If a conflict did arise that threatened the United States, it would certainly expend more munitions and weapon systems than the Ukraine-Russian war has spent.

For a historical example, the battles fought over Ukraine in World War II committed roughly a third of Germany’s and the Soviet Union’s armies on the Eastern Front. If there is a larger conflict today, the United States would have to commit many more weapons in more theaters than just Ukraine.

Without a strong production capability, the United States would have to sacrifice its commitments in several regions throughout the world. Many Americans don’t want to hear this, and many policymakers ignore this reality, but unless the industrial production gets stronger, we might see many more Afghanistan withdrawals and friendly nations subjugated by great power rivals. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote in December to Secretary of State Antony Blinken that there was a $18.7 billion weapons backlog for Taiwan. If the United States is falling behind in its support during peacetime, it would certainly fall further behind during a war.

For years, the United States ignored its industrial weakness and capability, and media outlets and politicians mocked the idea of shipbuilding and fleet sizes, only to find it a valid concern 10 years later. If the United States wants to compete in the coming decades on the world stage, it needs to address this clear weakness in its military. For the past 30 years, the United States has waged war on rogue nations and terrorists in distant regions. The world has changed, and those wars that were fought over the past decades should not be viewed as the standard for defense planners.

The CSIS report also mentions how high inflation is damaging U.S. production. Policymakers need to get the United States economy back on a strong footing, with a stronger dollar and a robust energy sector.

Hope in Historical Precedent

The good news is that this has been done before. In 1968, the United States was in a fairly similar situation as today. The Johnson administration had spent much on both domestic and foreign policy. The war on poverty and the Vietnam War had drained our nation’s budget, weakened its economy, and constrained its movement in the world. Throughout the 1970s the United States had high inflation, severe energy shortages, cultural divisions, and a defeated military. Due to the paralysis of the United States, the Soviet Union took advantage in the 1970s and expanded its influence in the world.

With the right reforms, the United States under President Ronald Reagan was able to challenge the Soviets by the mid-1980s and eventually win the Cold War to become the sole superpower in the 1990s. This is not that far off from where the United States is currently. The war on terror and war on Covid expended many of our nation’s resources, just as our chief rivals are becoming more aggressive.

The bad news is that the United States might not have long to right the ship. We need leaders and policymakers who can quickly make these important adjustments and have a clear and honest vision of what the future holds for the United States.

Why Even A Corrupt Ukraine Is Worth Supporting Against Russia,"Critics of America’s support for Ukraine often cite the latter’s corruption as a rationale not to provide assistance. Ukraine has struggled under the burden of corruption, but that does not override the fact that a Russian victory over Ukraine would be harmful to U.S. national security interests — two things can be true at the same time in a complicated world.

First, from a national security standpoint, Russia is one of a handful of hostile nation-states with nuclear weapons (or advanced nuclear programs) that pose a threat to America and its allies — the other nations being China, Iran, and North Korea.

Should Russia prevail against Ukraine, the threat to Europe and NATO, and thus the likelihood of direct U.S. intervention under NATO’s Article V, would be higher than it is today with the Ukrainians carrying on the fight themselves. A Russian victory in Ukraine would embolden Russian President Putin and confirm his view that the Western powers are weak, with an open invitation to test NATO resolve in the Baltic states.

Instead of a battlefield victory, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its resulting massive loss of tanks, artillery, and infantry has reduced the Russian threat to Europe — especially the frontline states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania — for a generation. This is entirely due to a successful Ukrainian resistance made possible by material and financial support from the U.S. and its European partners.

Unfortunately, the war drags on. Were Russia to leave Ukraine tomorrow, the war would stop.

Regarding whether it makes sense for the U.S. to provision Ukraine, a nation whose corruption has intruded onto our shores and into our politics, consider the U.S. World War II Lend-Lease program for context. This effort involved about $800 billion in assistance in today’s dollars or, as a share of GDP, more than $7 trillion to some 36 nations, including highly problematic or corrupt regimes like the Soviet Union and China, then ruled by the nationalists. While billions in aid were lost to corruption, the fact is that American capital allowed Allied soldiers to resist the Axis powers more effectively, saving American lives and shortening the war.

Wartime Corruption Is Par for the Course

Ukrainian corruption is hardly unique. Around the globe, public corruption is the rule, not the exception. Weak to nonexistent rule of law, family and tribal loyalties over allegiance to a state, and culture conspire to make clean, honest government rare.

I saw this firsthand in post-Soviet Russia in 1993. That’s when I was involved in creating the first Western-run commercial aviation technical stop in Kamchatka in the Russian Far East. We refueled cargo aircraft coming up from Taipei and Hong Kong, saving carriers about $25,000 per flight by avoiding the high landing charges and fuel costs at Hokkaido in Northern Japan.

Every week, suspicious Russians would want to renegotiate our joint venture agreement. At one point, a Russian civilian aviation official was attached to the Russian embassy in Japan. Suddenly, approvals for needed air routes over Russian air space started to be slow-rolled. I suspected the Japanese were applying “encouragement” to slow the competition. Eventually, when we had to invest millions more to be able to de-ice aircraft to FAA standards over the long Siberian winters, we finally had to say “nyet,” knowing that the Russians could simply take our investment at any time. It was a painful and costly lesson in doing business overseas, where rule of law was an alien concept.

Even America has had its challenges with political corruption, lest we think Ukraine is a special case. From New York’s Tammany Hall to Chicago City Hall, and points large and small from our founding to the present day, corruption can be found at all levels of government. This is especially true in wartime, as the pressures of urgently supplying the military run up against safeguards for public funds.

President Abraham Lincoln’s first secretary of war, Simon Cameron, lasted 10 months before corruption under his leadership became a costly distraction for the war effort — though it’s not as though there wasn’t ample warning that the “Great Winnebago Chief” might be given to bending the rules for personal profit. The Confederacy as well struggled with corruption, especially with regard to property confiscation.

Wartime, with its chaos and urgency, expands the opportunities for unscrupulous entrepreneurs and public officials.

In this context, Zelensky’s sacking of several high-ranking officials for corruption 11 months into Russia’s invasion should be seen as a positive, not a negative. It shows Zelensky has enough confidence in his government that it is able to withstand some needed internal housecleaning.

Community Wards Off Corruption

Lastly, there’s one largely unspoken factor weighing in Ukraine’s favor in its fight against corruption: the renewed strength of Ukraine’s civil society. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that Americans, unlike their counterparts in Europe, formed associations operating outside the sphere of government and economic life that met important needs. In the Soviet Union, these nascent voluntary associations were utterly crushed by the state. In places like communist China, they’re banned — nothing outside the Chinese Communist Party is allowed to exist. Yet during the opening stages of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, we saw remarkable images of Ukrainians spontaneously organizing to assemble Molotov cocktails and weld steel beams into vehicle barriers known as hedgehogs.

In this, the desperate battle for Voznesensk and its bridge over the Pivdennyi Buh River on the way to Odessa 100 miles to the southwest is instructive. During a two-day fight when Russia still appeared to have a plausible path to conquer Ukraine, a small detachment of Ukrainian soldiers was decisively supported by the farming town’s 34,000 civilians, including the mayor, shopkeepers, and old women. The townspeople armed themselves with hunting rifles and even threw bricks at the invading Russians. They blew their own bridge on the first day, frustrating Russian attempts to turn a vulnerable flank to get at Odessa. In the battle’s aftermath, the defenders were jubilant, displaying the sort of pride and initiative that will likely lead to a reduced acceptance of the corrupt old ways among average Ukrainians who survived the crucible of conflict.

The bottom line is that some U.S. aid to Ukraine is bound to end up corruptly enriching a few Ukrainians who now face an increased possibility of being prosecuted for it. Even so, Americans need to ask themselves: Is it worth it to severely degrade the threat from the Russian military, recover some of the credibility lost by the Biden administration in its embarrassing pullout from Afghanistan, and bolster deterrence against China; and is the expected level of corruption more or less than was experienced in the Lend-Lease effort that was so vital in vanquishing the threat from the Axis powers in WW2?

One last note on corruption: When Lincoln was vetting soon-to-be-Secretary Cameron, he asked Thaddeus Stevens, an acquaintance of Cameron, about his honesty. “I don’t think he would steal a red-hot stove” was Stevens’ reply. Cameron heard about it and demanded an apology, which Stevens delivered, “I apologize. I said Cameron would not steal a red-hot stove. I withdraw that statement.”",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/30/even-a-ukraine-struggling-to-control-corruption-is-worth-supporting-against-russian-aggression/,2023-01-30
27 Things The FBI Likely Found In Biden's Homes,"News broke on Wednesday that FBI agents, once again, were sifting through one of President Biden’s homes in an effort to find more classified documents he has harbored since his time in the U.S. Senate.

The searches began before the 2022 midterm election but, so far, the Department of Justice remains close-lipped about what they are looking for and what they’ve already discovered.

Thanks to Biden’s long history of rambling, we have a pretty good idea about many things the FBI has likely uncovered between their first search and now. Here’s everything the feds are likely to have found alongside sensitive information concerning Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom during their search of Biden’s homes.

Who Benefits From Our Prolonged Financing Of The Ukraine War?,"Image Credit Office of the President of the United States/Wikimedia

As we approach the first anniversary of the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s becoming increasingly important for Americans to ask: Who benefits?

America’s open checkbook for Ukraine is more likely to produce a long war than a swiftly decisive outcome. Three groups favor a long war in Ukraine: Vladimir Putin, the global industrial defense complex, and China.

As long as a state of war persists in Ukraine, even at a low simmer, Putin achieves his goal: Ukraine will not be part of NATO. As President Eisenhower cautioned, an overly powerful military-industrial complex risks putting its own interests and the truth at odds with America’s interests. Finally, China has greatly benefited from the ways America has squandered the post-Cold War era. American foreign policy needs strategic depth, not the same flawed approach that has left America less free, less safe, and more burdened by debt.

Pundits and intelligence professionals have attributed a host of motives to explain Putin’s unjust invasion of Ukraine. I won’t explore them here, but they all share one common theme. Putin does not want Ukraine to become a member of NATO or part of the European Union. While a state of war persists in Ukraine, neither will happen.

Providing an expectation that America will either fight or fund another endless war risks a catastrophic failure. Moreover, since our rational objectives do diverge, it provides no incentive for Ukraine’s President Zelensky to pursue more limited objectives or alternatives to America’s blank check.

Clearly, the people who make our weapons and ammunition benefit from selling more weapons and ammunition. America’s defense industrial base is and must remain the best to preserve America’s advantage on the battlefield. However, the post-Cold War era has been consumed by strategic blunders and unforced errors that have set them back and harmed our national security.

America spent nearly $7 trillion fighting a necessary but poorly focused war in response to the 9/11 attacks. We see the contrast clearly between the original war in Iraq and the much more efficient and focused effort to defeat ISIS. Finally, after years of ill-defined missions, the rational approach — using the economy of force (an enduring principle of war) — prevailed.

Finally, China employs a whole of government approach to advancing its interests that has vastly out-maneuvered America and the West in the post-Cold War era. While America has engaged in endless wars, the Chinese Communist Party has tripled its economy, grown its middle class, and focused on a global strategy that has everyone in the world except the U.S. building closer relationships with China. It’s time to focus on America’s interests — interests that empower our own government to deliver results for our own citizens.

Without succinct, principled objectives, neither our diplomats nor our warriors can be held accountable for success or failure. If not by design, certainly in effect, this lack of clarity produces long, low-grade wars rather than decisive outcomes. This same failure mode is well underway in Ukraine.

As we approach the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion, having spent more than Russia on the war, what exactly is the mission? Is it regime change in Russia? No Russian troops in Ukraine? Including Crimea? Or maybe, any peaceful resolution that prevents the spread of war to our NATO allies?

We have no mission, so there can be no accountability, and this same reactionary failure mode perversely serves the interests of others at the expense of our citizens. American foreign policy needs strategic depth, not just defense spending. That begins with a cogent mission statement for Ukraine that preserves our power where it will be most needed.

What Biden Won't Tell You About The Dire State Of Our Union,"The state of our union is a complete, unmitigated disaster.

The economy is in shambles, the border is two years into the worst migrant influx in U.S. history, taxpayer dollars are flying into the hands of a corrupt Eastern European regime without oversight, and our No. 1 enemy — Red China — has compromised our president, our politicians, our phones, and our skies.

Much as he did in his lie-riddled speech last year, President Joe Biden will likely try to use his State of the Union address to Congress this week to credit himself for helping the nation back onto its feet. In reality, he’s done nothing but subject Americans to more crippling crises that prompt historic levels of disapproval.

In an unprecedented “level of sustained pessimism,” 71 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track. Four in 10 Americans, the most in 37 years, told ABC News/Washington Post pollsters they have become financially worse off since Biden took office in January of 2021.

In the last few months, even Democrats have turned on their party leader after seeing his incompetence. Following the 2022 midterm elections, 52 percent of Democrats expressed a desire for Biden to seek reelection in 2024. Days before his address, support for a second Biden term fell to 37 percent among the president’s key voting bloc.

Polls may be a flawed means for gauging the public’s reaction but even without them, it isn’t difficult to see that the Biden regime is an absolute embarrassment from top to bottom.

Here’s what Biden will conveniently fail to mention in Tuesday night’s address.

The Economy Is Not ‘Roaring Back’

Biden will likely spend a good portion of his speech boasting that financial legislation such as the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress is restoring American jobs, wages, and savings and causing inflation to “fall.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are still suffering from gas prices well above $3 per gallon, being gaslit about how Biden didn’t induce a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021.

In 2022 alone, U.S. households lost $6.8 trillion in wealth thanks to record-high inflation that isn’t going away, crashing stocks, and a teetering housing market.

No matter which way Biden, the “experts,” or the corporate media try to spin it, the economy and Americans’ pocketbooks are not roaring back as Biden told Congress they would last year.

The Border Is Getting Worse

One year after he removed the border protections his predecessor enacted, Biden told Congress in his 2022 SOTU address that he wanted to “secure our border.”

""If we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system,"" President Joe Biden says. ""As you might guess, I think we can do both."" #SOTU https://t.co/OpTY2nX7Ns pic.twitter.com/qHE7eum9Ax — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 2, 2022

Then, the president spent the next 10 months ignoring the rapidly expanding humanitarian and criminal crisis before finally making a performative visit to El Paso in early January.

If history tells us anything, Biden’s 2023 SOTU speech will point to his trip and the new border crossing loopholes he created as “proof” that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding into the United States.

But Biden’s plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela so long as they fly to a port of entry in the U.S. only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives.

The U.S. Isn’t Tough on China

Biden’s speechwriters will probably credit the downing of Red China’s spy balloon, which completed its mission before it was shot down, as a symbol of the administration’s toughness on our nation’s No. 1 competitor.

What they won’t likely mention is that Biden sold oil from our emergency reserves to his son’s friends at a Chinese state-controlled gas giant before pushing the Saudis into an amicable relationship with the CCP.

Biden may have agreed to ban TikTok from government devices, but that won’t stop House Republicans from getting to the bottom of his family’s financial connections to Red China.

Biden Is Under Investigation for His Failures

Not only will Biden skip over his failures, but you can also expect him to pretend he’s not under investigation by congressional Republicans for various derelictions of duty including failing to secure the border, weaponizing the federal government against its political enemies, and harboring classified documents from his time as a senator and vice president.

Ukraine Is a Taxpayer-Funded Money Pit

Biden opened his 2022 SOTU with a tribute to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a promise that the U.S. would keep providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom.

One year and approximately $113 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars later, there is no end to the conflict in sight. Nothing is guaranteed other than Biden’s repeated promise to funnel American tax dollars to Ukraine for “as long as it takes” to stave off Russia.

Instead of ending the conflict, Biden’s overeagerness to get involved in a proxy war Congress hasn’t formally authorized the U.S. to participate in has just increased the threat of nuclear war.

Biden Is No Moderate

Biden spent a good portion of his 2022 SOTU masquerading as a social moderate who wanted to “secure the border” and “fund the police” instead of discuss identity politics.

As evidenced by another year of radical policies and actions like weaponizing the Department of Justice against law-abiding, pro-life Americans such as the recently acquitted Mark Houck and the former president, the Biden administration is far from abstaining from the culture war.

Since this is the first SOTU since the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs v. Jackson case, Biden will likely use his speech as a platform to push for abortion on demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy. He might even discuss his administration’s attempts to push back on states that ban mutilative transgender surgeries.

…and He’s Certainly No Unifier

Favorable corporate media coverage predicts that Biden will use his address on Tuesday to call for a “fresh start” and bipartisan cooperation between the GOP-controlled House and Democrat-run Senate. Biden wants to look like he’s Mr. Nice Guy by giving the other side of the aisle a chance to work with him.

But the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him and tried to criminalize the conservative agenda ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. He has no tolerance for House Republicans and certainly has no tolerance for the voters and values those legislators represent.

Simply put, Biden’s track record is indefensibly terrible. It shouldn’t be hard for viewers to look past his inevitable gaffes to see this SOTU will be another unremarkable speech littered with lies and failed promises.

McConnell's SOTU Tie Tells Us Which Nation He's Worried About,"Image Credit MSNBC/YouTube

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has never shied away from shilling for Ukraine. But for Tuesday night’s State of the Union address, the Kentucky Republican took it up a notch with a wardrobe statement piece.

While attending President Joe Biden’s largely incoherent speech, McConnell forwent America’s red, white, and blue, instead wearing a tie emblazoned with the colors of the Ukrainian flag: blue and yellow. Like a NASCAR driver, McConnell was apparently just sporting the hues of the brand he represents.

A lot of people are mocking McConnell for this, but I like it when NASCAR drivers and politicians wear the colors of the brands they represent. https://t.co/SyZsApDi69 — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 8, 2023

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, the Senate minority leader has been one of Congress’s biggest proponents of shipping endless U.S. taxpayer dollars overseas to fund the conflict. Back in May, for instance, McConnell issued the most tone-deaf statement imaginable by claiming that “we all agree the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine.” The remark came at a time when voters said “lowering inflation and fixing the economy” was their most important issue heading into the 2022 midterms.

Rather than encourage the Biden administration to push for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict, McConnell has been at the forefront of Senate efforts to throw more dollars and military help at Ukraine. During December’s negotiations on the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill, which passed as a result of Senate Republican support and will further increase America’s ballooning national debt, McConnell made more aid to Ukraine one of his top spending priorities. In 2022 alone, McConnell helped approve over $100 billion in aid and military assistance to the eastern European nation.

Make no mistake: McConnell’s Hollywood-style fashion statement on Tuesday night was a message not only to Ukraine but to Republican voters. The blue and yellow tie is just another signal from McConnell to conservatives that their priorities mean jack squat to him and his friends in Republican leadership. It’s a clear display of the elitist attitude felt by many within GOP ranks, who see Republican voters as nothing more than tools to be used every election cycle to maintain their hold on power.

China's Nuclear Arsenal Is A Bigger Threat Than The Spy Balloon,"The sight of a Chinese spy balloon last week has forced many Americans to confront the security threat the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) poses to America’s homeland. Unfortunately, the CCP possesses something far scarier and deadlier than balloons: a rapidly growing stockpile of nuclear weapons.

Measured by the number of nuclear warheads, China has at least 350 as of June 2022, far less than Russia’s 5,977 and the United States’ 5,428. Still, the speed at which China is building up its nuclear arsenal is worrisome.

Last year, a U.S. Department of Defense report predicted that “China would field a stockpile of about 1,500 warheads by 2035.” At the end of last month, right before the balloon became national news, the Pentagon told Congress, “The number of land-based fixed and mobile ICBM launchers in China exceeds the number of ICBM launchers in the United States.” ICBM stands for intercontinental ballistic missile, which can reach a target more than 5,000 miles away. Whether by coincidence or design, during the balloon’s week-long “tour” in the U.S., it flew by Montana, where more than 100 U.S. ICBMs are stationed.

One explanation of the CCP’s motive for rapidly growing its nuclear weapons stockpiles is that the CCP has witnessed how Russia’s possession of nuclear weapons has deterred Western democracies and the United States from directly engaging in a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Should China’s People’s Liberation Army invade Taiwan, the CCP probably hopes its growing nuclear weapon stockpiles will also deter Taiwan’s allies, including Japan and the U.S., from coming to Taiwan’s rescue. Undoubtedly, China’s nuclear weapons threaten the security of the U.S. and its allies in Asia.

What’s even more depressing is that the U.S. helped China build its nuclear weapons. The Wall Street Journal reported that the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), the nation’s top nuclear weapons research institute, has been able to acquire U.S.-made advanced semiconductor chips on the open market in the last two years to assist Chinese scientists’ research, which can have applications to China’s nuclear weapons program.

This revelation shocked many because the U.S. government has put such advanced semiconductor chips on its export restriction list and blacklisted CAEP on an entity list, aiming to prevent American firms from selling semiconductor chips to CAEP. The Bureau of Industry and Security, a U.S. Department of Commerce division, has administered most of the export controls for decades. Yet Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) analysis found that U.S. semiconductor exports to China increased between 2014 and 2018. The CSET’s research and the WSJ report prove that the Bureau of Industry and Security needs to administer and enforce export controls more effectively.

Equally depressing is the Biden administration’s blind faith in denuclearization through an arms-control treaty. President Obama signed an arms control pact, known as a New START, with Russia in 2010. The treaty limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each.

New START has many flaws, one of which is that it doesn’t address how to limit Russia’s capacity to pursue other nuclear weapons outside the treaty. Predictably, Russia has been taking advantage of this loophole by modernizing its existing nuclear weapons and developing new ones while claiming compliance with the treaty.

Rather than addressing New START’s many defects, President Biden extended it to another five years on his second day in office. His administration tried to cap China’s nuclear weapon buildup by bringing it into New START’s framework, and China adamantly refused.

A few days ago, Russia reportedly breached the New START treaty by refusing to allow on-site inspection of its nuclear arsenal. The treaty risks falling apart right in front of our eyes.

While the New START treaty has failed to limit Russia’s nuclear weapon buildup, according to Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican from Alabama who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, it “has inhibited the U.S. from building up its arsenal to deter Russia and China.”

The Biden administration’s approach risks putting America in a perilous situation. There is no ending in sight of the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Biden administration has gotten the U.S. more profoundly involved with the conflict by throwing enormous military resources into Ukraine “every two weeks, like clockwork,” according to John Kirby, the spokesman for the Pentagon.

Suppose China’s Xi Jinping decides to invade Taiwan as soon as 2025, as predicted by four-star Air Force Gen. Mike Minihan. In that case, the United States may be forced to involve itself in two military conflicts against two adversaries backed by nuclear weapons, and it will be a nightmare scenario.

Hopefully, the Chinese spy balloon incident will become a turning point, a wake-up call for a divided nation. We must stop infighting and self-imposed decline and destruction. Instead, we ought to focus our energy and resources on how to protect our homeland.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/09/chinas-growing-nuclear-arsenal-is-a-bigger-threat-than-a-spy-balloon-and-the-u-s-helped-make-it-possible/,2023-02-09

Like millions of the virtue signalers on Facebook who replaced the Black Lives Matter or Covid vaccination logos on their profile pictures, McConnell’s blue and yellow tie was a visual manifestation of his belief that support for Ukraine is the “the most important thing going on in the world.”

As President Joe Biden’s astonishing success in getting the Senate Republicans to rubber-stamp his decision to spend more than $100 billion on aid to Ukraine last year demonstrated, the Beltway GOP establishment is just as invested in the war in Ukraine as the Democrats.

Some of it is the product of the vestigial remnants of Reaganite policy toward the Soviet Union, which rightly believed that a willingness to engage and defeat Moscow wherever it sought to expand its reach was necessary. Yet despite the fact that Vladimir Putin dreams of reassembling Stalin’s empire, his Russia doesn’t pose the same threat to the West that the Soviet Union did.

That has been demonstrated by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s been, to put it mildly, a fiasco that exposed systemic incompetence. Outside the possibility of Biden blundering into a nuclear Third World War scenario, the Russians no longer present a potent threat to an expanding NATO.

Yet Republicans, such as Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., are still sounding the same sort of critique of Biden’s war policy that Republicans also used against weak-kneed Democrats who were soft on the communist threat in the last century. But according to Cotton’s pro-war manifesto published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal, in which he correctly states that Biden’s indecisiveness and weakness encouraged Putin to do something he didn’t dare try while Trump was president. He also argued Biden isn’t doing enough to support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s ambitions in the region.

But a consensus about preserving Ukrainian independence against Putin’s efforts to force it back into Soviet-era satellite status isn’t good enough for GOP hawks. They want a full American commitment to Zelensky’s quest to oust the Russians from every inch of soil that was under Ukrainian sovereignty in 2014. If that means giving Ukraine U.S. fighter jets, cluster bombs, and long-range missiles to hit targets deep inside Russia, then Cotton’s all for it. He believes anything short of a complete Ukrainian victory — however improbable that might be — would be a disaster and wants an American commitment to “war to the hilt” against Russia.

That may resonate with Republicans who came of age after the Vietnam War when Americans critiqued leaders who didn’t fight to win the wars they blundered into. He believes America should have a “strategy of victory” that will put an end to Russia’s ability to threaten Europe and deter China from invading Taiwan.

Unlike the declining regime in Moscow, Beijing does pose a global threat to U.S. interests. But Cotton gives no explanation for how disarming the American military in order to feed Zelensky’s war machine with no coherent plans for an arms buildup that would put us in a position to help anyone will achieve such deterrence.

More importantly, Republicans don’t seem to have given any serious consideration to the consequences of their plans.

No serious person thinks Ukraine can achieve a total victory over Russia in a war that, following Moscow’s setbacks last year, has settled into a World War One-style trench warfare stalemate.

But what would happen if a massive infusion of American high-tech weaponry as well as cash along the lines of Cotton’s dreams of escalation did lead to a Ukraine victory and, ultimately, Putin’s fall? Do the GOP hawks really think Putin’s regime would be replaced by a Western European-style liberal democracy that poses no threat to its neighbors? Perhaps those who have swallowed the myth that Zelensky is a paladin of American values rather than a typical leader of a corrupt, oppressive former Soviet republic actually believe that’s a possibility.

But the most likely outcome would be a bitter revanchist regime that would probably be even more dangerous than that of Putin. This might also entail the breakup of the Russian Federation and the emergence of unstable, dangerous states in places like Chechnya that could go to war with each other for control of Russia’s nuclear arsenal.

The Bush-era Republicans who still dominate the Senate GOP caucus have learned nothing from what happened in Iraq, where similarly well-intentioned schemes not only failed to defend American interests but made the world a more dangerous place.

The Ukrainians deserve credit for fighting bravely for their country, but the continuation of the current stalemate as the death tolls rise benefits only the political interests of Zelensky, Putin, and those who profit from the war. Bleeding Russia white simply to revive Cold War-era proxy wars with Moscow is not only deeply cynical. The notion that the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine as it was in 2014 has anything to do with the national interests of the United States, let alone its top security issue, would be laughable if it weren’t for the fact that so many Republicans actually believe it.

Ukraine is already strong enough to help contain a post-war Russia with or without Putin. And thanks to Trump’s efforts and the way Putin’s aggression has awakened America’s allies to their responsibilities, the idea that Moscow could successfully attack any of its NATO neighbors is no longer a serious proposition.

If instead of heeding the war hawks, Biden begins pushing for a compromise peace deal, Ukraine could be spared more years of a devastating war with countless casualties and damage to an already broken country. The same terms that the Ukrainians will eventually have to accept to end the war years from now are currently available if the West is willing to prioritize diplomacy over escalation. That will mean fewer dead and a lower price for the rebuilding of Ukraine that the United States will be expected to pay.

Republican voters may still revere Reagan’s memory, but most are aware that different challenges — such as China and a southern border that Biden won’t defend even as he pours U.S. resources into Ukraine — face the nation he once led. It’s time congressional Republicans listened more to their voters and less to pundits who labor under the delusion that Zelensky is the 21st-century Churchill. If they did, they’d be working to put a stop to a costly, unwinnable, and endless war in Ukraine rather than trying to make it even bloodier.

Media 'But Trump' To Distract From GOP's Biden Investigation,"One of House Republicans’ first steps after regaining the majority was to launch an investigation into President Joe Biden’s role in the Biden family’s lucrative pay-to-play business. Corporate media, however, are trying to distract from the first family’s scandals by conflating them with the conduct of the Trump family.

The Washington Post published an article last week, during the height of buzz about the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into the Biden family’s influence-peddling operation, pointing the corruption finger at former President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

“An investment fund overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is backing ventures that profit the former president and his senior adviser, raising questions of conflict,” the article alleges.

Within days of the report’s publication, corporate media outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, and even Rolling Stone featured anti-Trump information on their pages and networks.

The point of amplifying the report is twofold. First, it gives the media and their Democrat allies more ammo against Trump’s third presidential run. The Washington Post is clear about that:

Now, with Trump running for president again, some national security experts and two former White House officials say they have concerns that Trump and Kushner used their offices to set themselves up to profit from their relationship with the Saudis after the administration ended.

Second, reports about the Trumps give anyone looking to escape conversations about the Biden family’s well-documented history of enriching their bank accounts with funds from foreign oligarchs an excuse to pivot to their favorite scapegoat.

Already, leftist commentators are claiming the Biden family “deserves grace,” while the Trumps deserve investigation. Despite countless real reports and ongoing federal investigations into the Biden family’s affairs, MSNBC’s Mehdi Hasan even bizarrely asserted there is “no real evidence” that the Biden family business leveraged Joe Biden’s status for personal profit.

""The president & a close family member making a ton of money off their dealings with a foreign country, peddling access to enrich themselves. It's an outrageous abuse of power. But I’m not talking about Hunter Biden. I'm talking about Jared Kushner.""

The Political Enemy Playbook

Even before Trump’s White House tenure, the corporate media did everything in their power to make him look like a corrupt politician who was sold out to foreign governments. When they weren’t amplifying the Russia hoax, a fake scandal created and paid for by Democrats, the propaganda press scrutinized Trump’s tweets, twisted his words, and tried to undermine his presidency with lies that won Pulitzers.

They also aided Democrats in orchestrating two sham impeachments against Trump, whom they claimed was guilty of treason. These political attacks were sustained with plenty of negative press coverage of Trump’s sons, daughters, and son-in-law.

Where was the media’s outrage about White House familial corruption when Hunter exploited his father’s political reputation to strike business deals with oligarchs in Ukraine and China and then likely gave a cut to his dad? Joe Biden and his youngest son are the epitomai of the scandal and corruption Democrats and the corrupt corporate media desperately want Trump and his family to be.

There are literal receipts of the Biden family conducting shady business dealings overseas and profiting from relationships with sworn enemies, yet publications such as The Washington Post and The New York Times worked overtime to downplay and mischaracterize the findings to save the Biden patriarch from criticism and losing the 2020 election.

They didn’t want the public to know that when Biden was vice president and overseeing the Obama administration’s Ukraine relations, Hunter received a whopping $50,000 per month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company he had no qualifications to be on. They didn’t want the public to hear that Hunter also raked in millions from the wife of the former Moscow mayor, and they certainly didn’t want Americans to discover that just two weeks after he traveled to communist China on his dad’s Air Force Two jet, Hunter helped his Chinese business partners secure a deal that gave them control of a cobalt mine in Congo.

No, for the media, there was no politically advantageous reason to expose that “an arm of the Chinese government” funneled money directly to a company managed by Hunter to compensate him for offering legal representation to the vice-chairman and secretary-general of Chinese energy company CEFC, Dr. Patrick Ho Chi Ping, the “spy chief of China.” And there was certainly no good reason for them to communicate that Ho, who was arrested, charged, and later convicted for using millions of dollars to “bribe top officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC,” made a phone call to James Biden, Joe’s brother.

Instead of covering bombshell stories about the questionable actions of a tight-knit family whose patriarch is in charge of the U.S. government, the propaganda press is still hyper-fixated on the Trumps.

When they aren’t going after the former first family, the media are amplifying the current president’s excuses and shilling for his son, who admitted through his lawyers that the infamous laptop exposing the Biden family’s foreign dealings was his. This investigation, they have claimed over and over and over and over and over, is a politically motivated one. But it’s not.

It’s About Joe, Stupid

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has repeatedly declared Republican investigators are interested in Joe Biden’s “knowledge of and role in his family’s foreign business deals to assess whether he has compromised national security,” not Hunter.

“Evidence obtained in our investigation reveals the Biden family business model is built on Joe Biden’s political career and connections. Biden family members attempted to sell access around the world, including individuals who were connected to the Chinese Communist Party, to enrich themselves to the detriment of American interests,” Comer said in a statement last week. “If President Biden is compromised by deals with foreign adversaries and they are impacting his decision making, this is a threat to national security.”

EXCLUSIVE: Incoming House Oversight Committee Chair @RepJamesComer (R-Ky.) says an investigation into Hunter Biden wouldn't be ""political.""



Comer: ""Let me be clear. We're not investigating Hunter Biden. We're investigating Joe Biden."" pic.twitter.com/4PkqNej5OT — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 8, 2023

Despite the corporate media’s attempts to distract from, stifle, and smear Republicans’ investigation into the Biden family business by going after Trump again, the GOP can’t give up. Unlike when Democrats rallied their partisan network to falsely paint Trump as a Russian asset, this legitimate and evidence-based investigation is essential to determining whether U.S. national security is compromised from top to bottom because of Biden.

"Hawley: Stop Blank Checks To Ukraine, Start Deterring Red China","Sen. Josh Hawley wants GOP warmongers and leftist globalists to know that funneling American taxpayer dollars to Ukraine instead of addressing the rising threat that is communist China is a huge mistake.

Contrary to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s on-the-record declaration that “Defeating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important event going on in the world right now,” Hawley is urging U.S. leaders to advance a nationalist foreign policy that “would put America’s interests first” and prioritize addressing the threat China poses to the U.S. and the world.

“Deterring China from seizing Taiwan should be America’s top foreign policy priority,” the Republican from Missouri said during a speech at The Heritage Foundation on Thursday.

Time to hear some truth about China that too few in Washington, D.C. will acknowledge. We are LIVE with @HawleyMO as he lays out a defense policy to take on America's greatest external threat, the Chinese Communist Party. https://t.co/AC2tpRQh35 — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) February 16, 2023

The Uniparty

For too long, Hawley said U.S. foreign policy was dictated by an out-of-touch “uniparty” that sees “writing blank checks to other countries” as a solution.

“The truth is, we are over-committed,” Hawley said. “Our elites aren’t deluded by the dream of a liberal empire. The uniparty tells us that we’re on the right side of history and tough trade-offs don’t exist. That’s just not true.”

This uniparty, Hawley said, wants Americans to believe that “we can fight an endless proxy war in Ukraine” and that will keep China at bay.

“We have leaders on both parties, former NATO brass telling us that defending Ukraine is basically the same thing as deterring China,” Hawley said.

The truth, the senator continued, is that the uniparty’s impossible dreams of democratizing China and enriching the U.S. economy by allowing the communist nation into the World Trade Organization in 2001 already exposed the weakness of the foreign policy that dominates the D.C. hivemind.

“The uniparty’s way is not sustainable. It is a path to failure,” Hawley said.

Those same motivations, Hawley said, prolonged American involvement in the Middle East and had disastrous results.

“We invested billions of dollars there and lost hundreds of thousands of American lives all while China rose unimpeded. And the people who are responsible for those misjudgments are still members of the D.C. establishment in good standing and nobody has ever been held accountable. Now we’re hearing the same siren song again. This time, it’s about Ukraine,” Hawley said.

It’s clear, he added, that “our current foreign policy is not working.”

“It has not worked for decades,” he said. “It’s not working for our security. It’s not working for our economy. And above all, it is not working for the American people. It has cost many of them their jobs, their towns, and their communities.”

The Need for a Nationalist Foreign Policy

Hawley said he believes the U.S. does have a role to play on the global scale but that it needs to happen through the lens of a nationalist foreign policy.

“That begins with being strong here at home and protecting our folks,” Hawley said.

It also means addressing the nation’s top enemy. “The core problem is our actions in Ukraine are directly affecting our ability to deter our most pressing adversary, that is, China in the Pacific,” Hawley said.

The senator acknowledged that at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he voted to send money to the afflicted country because “I had no idea that we were going to fight an endless proxy war and do nation-building there because that’s not what we said we’re going to do in the beginning.”

“The truth is we cannot defend Ukraine and stop China in Taiwan, and see to our own military requirements at the same time; we simply cannot do it all. And frankly, we shouldn’t have to,” Hawley said.

Sending billions more to Ukraine to promote a “stable rules-based international order” that appeases the “D.C. establishment that transcends all changing administrations” and is designed to force regime change in Russia, Hawley said, is “nonsense.” Especially because “China is on the march.”

“We are not at this moment prepared to stop them. We didn’t stop them cheating on trade. We didn’t stop them from stealing our industry. We didn’t stop them in Hong Kong. And now, if China invades Taiwan, they would prevail,” Hawley said.

He noted that stopping China from expanding its global influence starts with ending blank checks to Ukraine, reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe, and arming Taiwan.

“I’m not in favor of blank checks to anybody,” Hawley said. “So I’m not here to tell you that I don’t favor blank checks to Ukraine, but I do favor them to Taiwan. No, quite the contrary. My view is we have got to help the Taiwanese defend themselves. We should be arming and supporting the Taiwanese but on the condition that they spend on their own defense, that they embrace an asymmetric defense strategy, and that they go all in on the defense of their island and prepare to defend it from any potential Chinese invasion.”

Hawley knows his proposal will not be popular among his neo-con colleagues in Congress.

“It’s hard to challenge the uniparty,” Hawley admitted. “They’ve gotten pretty good at telling their favorite story which is why anybody who questions them these days gets labeled as anti-American or Putin’s puppet.”

Hawley may get pushback on Capitol Hill but that won’t stop him from embracing a new foreign policy that he believes better reflects and protects American interests.

“This country is the strongest country on the face of the Earth. We’re the best country in the history of the world. We can prevail. I have every confidence that in this conflict with China, for the future of the world, we will prevail. And above all, for our own way of life, we will prevail. But we must make the choices now to make sure that that possibility becomes reality,” Hawley said.

McConnell's Ukraine Obsession Shows His Disdain For Americans,"Image Credit Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell/YouTube

With a faltering economy, a wide open southern border, imminent national security threats from the Chinese government, and radical leftists trying to co-opt unsuspecting kids into their social movements, the United States under the “leadership” of President Joe Biden is in a tailspin. So naturally, out-of-touch swamp creatures such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell felt it was appropriate to remind us plebs about what’s really important: Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

While donning his infamous Ukrainian flag-colored tie during his Thursday appearance on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom,” the Kentucky Republican arrogantly regurgitated the most tone-deaf statement imaginable by claiming that “defeating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important event going on in the world right now.”

“It will save us an enormous amount of money down the road if the Ukrainians can succeed,” McConnell baselessly opined.

NEW – McConnell: ""Defeating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important event going on in the world right now.""pic.twitter.com/H8RkVKAhno — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) February 16, 2023

It’s no secret in Washington that McConnell is obsessed with shipping endless amounts of taxpayer money to Ukraine — the second most corrupt country in Europe — with virtually no oversight. So much so that his blue and yellow tie has become the GOP equivalent of Hillary Clinton’s pantsuits.

But maybe I’m being too hard on McConnell. I mean, it’s not like America’s own borders are being overrun by millions of illegal aliens or the U.S. economy is in free fall — with skyrocketing inflation making it harder for Americans to afford basic necessities, such as food and gas.

And it’s not like the United States’ number one global competitor — the Chinese Communist Party — is sending surveillance aircraft into U.S. airspace with virtually no pushback from America’s commander-in-chief, whose family has alarming financial ties to the Chinese government. Nor are there radical, left-wing activists attempting to ideologically co-opt unsuspecting children from their parents and trans them without their parents’ knowledge.

And heaven forbid if a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in Ohio, polluting the local town’s land, water, and air, and leaving residents in dire straits.

Oh, that’s right. All of those things are happening in America right now.

But as McConnell signaled during his Fox appearance, if we don’t approve of his obsession with giving billions of dollars to Ukraine, we can all go pound sand.

“I’m sorry public opinion is sliding [on U.S. military support for Ukraine], but I want to reassure the American people [that] this is enormously important,” he said.

In other words, he doesn’t care what Americans think and will continue to press ahead.

[READ: Poll: Less Than Half Of Americans Support Shipping Our Weapons To Ukraine]

McConnell and the GOP establishment despise their voters and the American people writ large. They don’t care about our everyday needs, or the fact that America’s left is attempting to rip the very fabric of our republic apart at the seams.

For them, Ukraine is just another shiny object they’ll chase until the cows come home. But by the time they abandon their latest folly and realize the calls are coming from inside the house, there will be no country left to save.

Less Than Half Of Americans Support Sending Ukraine Weapons,"Image Credit Garry Knight / Flickr

As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears its one-year anniversary on Feb. 24, many Americans’ patience is wearing thin. A new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that American support for shipping weapons and tax dollars off to Ukraine is declining.

Less than half of Americans, 48 percent, now say they favor the U.S. providing weapons to Ukraine, with 29 percent opposed and 22 percent neither in favor nor opposed. This is a decline from May 2022, when less than three months into the conflict 60 percent of U.S. adults were in favor of sending weapons to Ukraine.

Americans are equally divided on whether to send cash. Thirty-seven percent favor it, 38 percent are opposed, and 23 percent are neither in favor nor opposed.

For a war with no end in sight that has already cost U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion in less than one year, it makes sense that public support for funding the conflict is waning, especially as Americans are more concerned about how they’ll foot their wildly inflated grocery bill or handle declining wages, due in part to the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Meanwhile, a fentanyl crisis — thanks to truckloads of illegal drugs smuggled into the country via the same disastrous border policies — is wreaking havoc on poor, blue-collar communities. More than 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2021 alone.

Americans seem to increasingly want the Biden administration to focus on issues at home. This is why almost half of them want Biden to help Ukraine negotiate a peace settlement with Russia. Perpetual funding of a proxy war overseas is simply not a priority for the average American, whether Democrat or Republican, which is probably why Biden administration officials reportedly warned Ukraine quietly that Americans have limited patience for endless wars.

Of course, in giving Zelensky and his ilk more money, the American war chest extends Ukraine’s ability to fight and thus prolongs the war — a fact to which Americans seem to be waking up. Whether the money actually goes to the war effort or lines a Ukrainian oligarch’s pockets is an open question.

Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., might think supporting Ukraine’s war effort against Russia is “the single most important event” going on right now, but fewer and fewer Americans agree.

"To Win GOP, Nikki Haley Needs To Atone For Her Neocon Policies","Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley officially launched her bid for president this week, but if she really wants to resonate with conservative voters and win the Republican nomination, Haley needs to atone for her long list of foreign policy failures.

Get excited! Time for a new generation.



Let’s do this! 👊 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/BD5k4WY1CP — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) February 14, 2023

Haley says she’s tired of the Washington establishment failing U.S. voters and she’s ready to “rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure the border, and strengthen our country, our pride, and our purpose.” Her history of pursuing an interventionist agenda, however, will not be easily forgotten. To have a shot at a successful GOP campaign, she has to prove that the aimless military adventurism that puts America last and the U.S. war machine first is behind her.

The Bush Era Revived

Haley officially advanced her failed foreign policy agenda during her tenure as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from January 2017 to January 2018. By that time, it was clear from both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars that U.S. interventionism in the Middle East was a huge waste of time, funds, and American lives. Yet Haley repeatedly advocated for the U.S. to insert itself and our military in conflicts with Iran, Syria, North Korea, and other foreign countries.

Despite former President Donald Trump’s explicit demands that his administration pivot away from the Bush-era intervention that plagued his GOP predecessors, Haley pushed Trump to take a more militant approach to Iran.

In late 2017, Haley furthered her quest by claiming there was “undeniable” evidence that Iran supplied weapons to Yemeni rebels in their fight against Saudi Arabia. The UN later said that evidence was insufficient, but that didn’t stop Haley from trying to conjure up a U.S.-led global crackdown on Iran and “what they’re doing.”

“The fight against Iranian aggression is the world’s fight,” she declared.

U.S. national security was not immediately threatened because several Middle Eastern countries were infighting, but Haley wanted to involve America.

She did the same thing with Syria in early 2017. The same year she advocated for American meddling in Saudi Arabia’s battle, Haley led the administration’s change of tune on regime change in Syria. In March 2017, Haley announced, “our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out.” Days later in April, Haley pivoted and said one of the Trump administration’s top priorities was evicting the Bashar al-Assad regime, not orchestrating peace settlements.

She claimed there was “not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime” and expressed a strong desire for the U.S. military to continue its attacks on Assad against UN opposition.

Later in 2019, when Trump withdrew American troops from Syria to avoid another decades-long, expensive stint of U.S. intervention in the Middle East, Haley complained that her former boss was leaving U.S. allies “to die” and leaving a regional hole that would be quickly filled by bloodthirsty Turks.

Haley opposed the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan — botched and deadly though Biden’s attempt was — in 2021 on similar grounds.

“Our enemies have always hoped this day would come,” she said. “They know from history that when America retreats, freedom falters.”

The Warmongering Continues

Even after she left her foreign policy post, Haley pursued warmongering activism. Thanks to her hawkish behavior during her time in the Trump administration, Haley was rewarded with a seat on the board of Boeing, one of the biggest defense contractors in the U.S. war profit machine. Her foreign policy influence was also sustained by regular speaking engagements geared toward escalation-hungry audiences via her Stand for America nonprofit.

Haley has been clear she’s “no fan of tariffs” against enemies like China even though they work. She prefers more hard-hitting actions like threatening to send the U.S. to war with the communist country over Taiwan. Ironically, Haley is one of the many American politicians who support U.S. involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war even though spending money in Eastern Europe leaves fewer resources for Taiwan.

American support for funding the war in Eastern Europe has plummeted drastically since the U.S. first started sending cash and weapons to Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022, and Haley appears to have toned down her pro-Ukraine rhetoric ahead of her presidential announcement — but her support for dumping endless taxpayer dollars into the conflict is no secret. She has criticized the U.S. for coming “late to the game” in funding Ukraine. Likewise, over and over, Haley claimed the U.S. has a “duty” to fund the Ukrainian regime, which is plagued with allegations of corruption, to advance “freedom and democracy” and weaken, by proxy, Russian head Vladimir Putin.

“When you see a freedom-loving country trying to protect their own turf, we should give them every ounce of ammunition they need,” Haley said in April 2022.

Weakness invites war. Strength deters it. We must help keep Ukraine and President Zelenskyy strong. pic.twitter.com/FQ9ic28TUJ — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) April 27, 2022

If Haley doesn’t apologize for and change her warmongering ways, she signals a return to the Bushian interventionism that so many conservative voters overwhelmingly reject through their embrace of candidates like Trump.

"Biden Fiddles In Ukraine While U.S. Border, Infrastructure Burn","Americans received a pristine view of Democrats’ disastrous America-Last policies this morning as Joe Biden paid a surprise visit to Ukraine while his own country literally burns with manmade disasters he continues to inflame.

Biden’s Federal Emergency Management Agency denied any money to help clean up a burning chemical disaster zone in the Republican state of Ohio, but Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear that Biden will get a blank check to slosh around hundreds of billions from U.S. taxpayers to prolong the carnage of war in Ukraine — and the profits from it from insane deficit spending that also threatens U.S. national security.

Not only is key U.S. infrastructure on fire stateside, but Biden, in violation of his oath of office, also set the U.S. border figuratively on fire immediately upon assuming the presidency by lifting former President Trump’s effective enforcement of U.S. national security laws. Cities and towns across the United States are overwhelmed with mass human trafficking and the outsourcing of U.S. border control to international drug cartels allied with the top U.S. foreign adversary, Red China.

It’s no surprise that American support for expanding the U.S. proxy war with Russia is declining. They can see that their neighbors have to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for health insurance even if they never see a doctor because they’re really paying off the health expenses of illegal migrants, and that their neighbors are dying from the fentanyl trafficked with the human flood of misery across the border.

And where is Biden as his country is in flames? Hiding from his crimes against Americans, our laws, and our Constitution by urging continued atrocities while doing a dog and pony show in Ukraine.

While forcing his own people — and those whose migration keeps the cartels supplied with the billions to buy military-grade weaponry — to suffer murder, rape, and other heinous crimes, Biden is abroad encouraging ongoing violence in Ukraine.

War is hell, especially for the vulnerable — women, children, and the elderly. But Democrats and their military-industrial complex believe death, rape, starvation, and continued demolishing of Ukranian homes and towns are a worthy trade for a shiny new excuse to open U.S. coffers wide to high-dollar campaign donors with no oversight. It’s no coincidence, surely, the dollar spigots are also flooding toward the very same country that supplied millions to politically influence Biden’s family — and, according to his family, to influence Biden himself.

This is Joe Biden’s “mission accomplished” moment. Or, it would be, if the hapless and embarrassing George W. Bush were as patently evil as the Democrats running Biden.

Remember, six weeks after he invaded Iraq, Bush stood in front of a banner proclaiming “Mission Accomplished.” U.S. troops remained in Iraq and Afghanistan for 20 more years, spending precious soldiers’ lives and trillions in American treasure to weaken our national security by distracting us from higher foreign policy priorities, such as China. Right after Bush gave the “Mission Accomplished” speech, Iraqi insurgents redoubled their efforts.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/20/joe-biden-fiddles-with-world-war-in-ukraine-as-u-s-border-railways-burn/,2023-02-20
Ron DeSantis Slams Biden For Handing Ukraine A 'Blank Check',"Image Credit Problem Is Solve / YouTube

In an interview on Fox and Friends Monday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis blasted President Joe Biden for handing Ukraine a “blank check,” gallivanting around Ukraine while the U.S. border is in shambles and involving the United States in an alarming proxy war with China.

WATCH: Gov. Ron DeSantis says U.S. has no ""interest"" on getting involved in ""proxy war,"" slams ""blank checks"" from Biden admin to Ukraine



""What is the strategic objective? […] Just saying it's an open-ended blank check [to Ukraine] is unacceptable."" pic.twitter.com/aXq7g4Epnz — Florida’s Voice (@FLVoiceNews) February 20, 2023

On Monday, President Biden announced the U.S. would be providing half a billion dollars in military aid to Ukraine (that’s in addition to the $113 billion we’ve already given). According to DeSantis, Biden’s “blank check” policy with Ukraine is not only irresponsible but dangerous. “They have effectively a blank check policy with no clear, strategic objective identified, and these things can escalate, and I don’t think it’s in our interests to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea,” DeSantis said.

“So I think it would behoove them to identify what is the strategic objective that they’re trying to achieve,” he continued, “but just saying it’s an open-ended blank check, that is not acceptable.”

DeSantis also heavily criticized Biden’s “surprise visit” to Ukraine — a trip that’s awarded the president melodramatic praise from the corporate press, Even though it is pretty transparently a publicity stunt to cover for the president’s disastrous handling of the Chinese spy balloon and the East Palestine chemical leak.

“He’s very concerned about those borders halfway around the world. He’s not done anything to secure our own border here at home,” said DeSantis. “We’ve had millions and millions of people pour in, tens of thousands of Americans dead because of fentanyl, and then, of course, we just suffered a national humiliation of having China fly a spy balloon clear across the continental United States.”

Indeed, upon taking office, Biden dismantled former President Donald Trump’s border security provisions and reinstated the Obama-era catch-and-release system, causing a massive spike in illegal immigration and, consequently, human and drug trafficking.

DeSantis also noted that the war in Ukraine may never have started had Biden not shown so much weakness in office, particularly in his embarrassing and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. “I don’t think any of this would have happened but for the weakness that the president showed during his first year in office, culminating, of course, in the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan,” DeSantis said.

According to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, there are growing concerns that China is sending aid to Russia via a form of “lethal assistance,” and it could further impact the United States’ increasingly antagonistic relationship with China.

DeSantis notes that Russia has proven it is not a serious threat to America. The real threat is China, and putting America in a proxy war with China is a dangerous game to play. “The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all of that and steamrolling … that is not even come close to happening,” DeSantis said. “I think they’ve shown themselves to be a third-rate military power. I think they’ve suffered tremendous, tremendous losses.”

“I got to think that the people in Russia are probably disapproving of what’s going on,” DeSantis continued. “I don’t think they can speak up about it for obvious reasons, so I think Russia has been really, really wounded here. And I don’t think that they are the same threat to our country, even though they’re hostile. I don’t think they’re on the same level as China.”

Biden Bypasses Americans To Sustain War In Ukraine Indefinitely,"Image Credit C-SPAN/Screenshot

Less than 24 hours after his staged trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, President Joe Biden told thousands of spectators in Warsaw, Poland, that he plans to indefinitely squander U.S. taxpayer dollars on a proxy war, despite Americans indicating they oppose this involvement.

“Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire,” Biden yelled on Tuesday during his occasionally incoherent remarks.

The event was promoted as a somber affair to mark one year since Russia invaded Ukraine. Biden’s speech, however, kicked off with the light-hearted air of a campaign stop, featuring background music by the Foo Fighters and Coldplay and photo opportunities with children waving American, Polish, and Ukrainian flags.

Back home, Americans plagued with sky-high inflation, a growing border crisis, and hazardous chemical spills are not as enthused by Biden’s words. Less than half of Americans support shipping weapons and cash to the Eastern European country, especially because, with no oversight, those funds are lining the pockets of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose regime is plagued with allegations of corruption.

Despite Americans’ opposition to prolonging an overseas war, Biden falsely claimed to his audience in Poland that Americans “are united in our resolve” to sponsor the Zelensky regime “for as long as it takes.”

Biden cited showy Ukraine flag virtue-signaling campaigns and Congress’s assistance in sending $113 billion taxpayer dollars and counting to Zelenksy as proof that Americans want to keep handing over blank checks to a foreign government.

“All across my country, in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes. Over the past year, Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom. That’s who Americans are, that’s what Americans do,” Biden said.

In a full embrace of the uniparty’s interventionist agenda, Biden claimed this commitment to “the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine” is rooted in the belief that Ukraine should be a “free, sovereign, and democratic” nation. “There’s no sweeter word than freedom. There is no nobler goal than freedom. There’s no higher aspiration than freedom. Americans know that, and you know it,” Biden said.

While his homeland crumbles, Biden touts dragging the U.S. into a global war in the name of advancing “democracy” and “sovereignty” overseas with no word about the negotiations required for de-escalation. On the contrary, Biden said the only end to this war he will accept is Russia ceasing its invasion, something President Vladimir Putin said he doesn’t plan to do.

“If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia, [it] would be the end of Ukraine,” Biden said.

Three Undeniable Truths From Putin’s Speech,"Other than that Russian President Vladimir Putin declared an end to a nuclear arms treaty with the U.S. — no biggie! — you’ll probably hear precisely nothing else from the press about what he had to say Tuesday during his lengthy address. That doesn’t mean the rest of his speech was unimportant. It means the national media, for their own reasons, don’t want you to hear it.

But you should hear it because when you remove the name “Vladimir Putin” from the equation, what he said during that 100-minute address to his nation was both indisputably true and rational, even if it deflates the media’s incessant, eye-roll-worthy framing of the conflict in Ukraine as “Putin’s unprovoked war” and “a fight for democracy.” (Gag.) Here are three examples:

1. “The U.S. has used Ukraine to prepare for a large war. They have publicly admitted that.” This is, in fact, implicit if not official policy articulated by the Biden administration. The president himself declared early last year that Putin “cannot remain in power,” a threat of forced regime change if there ever was one. Biden kicked off the week by visiting the capital of Ukraine, a literal war zone with no U.S. military presence, as if to claim the conflict is as much ours as it is Ukraine’s (and it is, given that we’re footing about two-thirds of Ukraine’s defense cost).

Even Republicans in Congress are flirting with the ignition of global war. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said we should designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has declared that the “defeat” of Russia is “the No. 1 priority for the United States right now.” (So much for lifting up America’s poor. They can wait, I guess.)

2. “The West is guilty of escalation.” Since well before Russia invaded Ukraine, Washington has promoted the expansion of new member nations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, an alliance that exists in its present form for the express purpose of intimidating Russia. What started out as a warning to the Soviet Union that the U.S. would defend its European allies against military aggression is now a vanity project for both of our political parties to look like heroes by further alienating the Kremlin from the rest of the developed world.

And because Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, dared to ask that NATO countries pay more into the alliance, and otherwise showed no interest in expanding it for the sake of itself, that naturally led to his opponents reflexively adopting the exact opposite position: that NATO is indispensable and Ukraine is the closest thing we have to the Garden of Eden. And so, the Biden administration pushed for Ukraine’s entry into NATO, even further encircling Russia with an alliance that Putin already had every reason to fear.

3. “They [the West] want to have a strategic defeat of Russia. … It means they want to have no more, anything to do with Russia. They want to have a global resistance against Russia.” What part of that contradicts anything the Biden administration, most of Congress, and virtually every former military official on cable news has said? They all say it.

Assume that right now Russia were to retreat from Ukraine and declare a truce. Who’s going to be the first to propose that the U.S. and Europe resume regular trade and cooperation to stabilize Russia’s economy and its standing in the world? None of them will. They all expect a lasting minimizing of Russia, preferably without Putin in the picture.

Say whatever you want about Putin, he’s not irrational.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/22/three-undeniable-truths-from-putins-speech/,2023-02-22
"In East Palestine And Everywhere, Biden Is Putting America Last","The forgotten man of the Midwest has been struck by grave tragedies this past month. While he’s still discovering how the train derailment in Ohio is affecting his health and environment, it has become clear the extent of the catastrophe could have been prevented if our country’s leadership had prioritized Americans first.

On Feb. 3, a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio and caught on fire, prompting Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to order an evacuation of the area. Officials allowed the train company to release the chemicals into the environment, causing a worse fire. Local residents have reported suffering various health problems, animals including an estimated 3,500 fish have perished, and the impact of water pollution on the Ohio River that supplies water to more than 5 million people is still unknown.

In the wake of a crisis vitally affecting so many Americans across the Midwest, their health and safety should be top of mind for anyone in leadership who stands to help. The response from the powers that be, however, was initially nonexistent. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg refused to acknowledge the event in any capacity for 10 full days.

The timeline of the Ohio disaster is alarming yet unsurprising. Buttigieg has spent his recent time prioritizing the left’s usual misplaced priorities such as “equity” and ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) policies over the tragedy in Ohio. The fallout following the disaster has served as a prime example of the difference in priorities for President Joe Biden versus those of former president and the 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

The Power of America First

The first act indicating any hope of relief came last Friday when Donald Trump Jr. broke the news that his father would be visiting the derailment site. The same day, Biden’s White House announced its plans to provide a multi-agency effort to help the formerly-unworthy residents of East Palestine — 14 days after the event. One day after alerting Gov. DeWine that the derailment’s effects didn’t qualify to receive federal aid, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reversed course and vowed to provide assistance.

George Papadopoulos said in a tweet the same day, “That’s the Trump effect. America first, always!”

On Tuesday, four days after news of Trump’s impending visit had broken, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relieved themselves of responsibility by pointing all fingers at the train company, charging them with all cleanup.

Some relief may finally be coming to those afflicted. Wednesday, Trump met with community members and local officials, and he personally donated thousands of gallons of cleaning supplies as well as food and water.

America First versus America Last

In this time of environmental crisis, Greta Thunberg and the usual climate change activists are nowhere to be found. Where are the students who felt so passionately about the notion of disrupting the system in the name of preventing environmental catastrophe they threw mashed potatoes at one of the most cherished works of art in the world?

I don’t need to ask where Biden is. He made his visit to Ukraine very public in an effort to show his unwavering support. While not a single person from the White House had even acknowledged the disaster in Ohio for 10 days, Joe Biden spent this week personally visiting Ukraine to announce a half billion dollars in new spending.

While Joe Biden claimed in his State of the Union speech earlier this month to fight for the “forgotten” man, the Ohio train derailment had already gone unaddressed by his administration for four days by that point. What man is he referring to?

The past year has been challenging for most Americans suffering from out-of-control gas and grocery prices, unsafe streets, radical school curricula, and an ever-growing fentanyl crisis. Every day proves the Biden administration is placing the well-being of the American people last, and nowhere is that clearer than in East Palestine, Ohio.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/25/in-east-palestine-and-everywhere-biden-is-putting-america-last/,2023-02-25
Davidson: Biden Admin Is Slowly Dragging Us To War In Ukraine,"“The slip-of-the-tongue from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was kind of saying the quiet part out loud,” Federalist Senior Editor John Daniel Davidson told Fox News’s Laura Ingraham. “There are people and there are forces in the Biden administration and in the government, and especially in Washington, in both parties that would like the U.S. to get directly involved in this conflict. They have reasons of their own for wanting that, but they know they can’t just kind of come out and do it right away or declare war, that the American people aren’t behind them.”

“And so they’re kind of slow-walking us toward direct engagement … and we’re seeing it now with this visit from the secretary of defense and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with the increasing complexity in advanced weapons and troop training that’s going on, and we’re being lulled into involvement in this war, and I’m afraid it’s going to get much more obvious in the weeks to come,” he added.",https://thefederalist.com/videos/davidson-biden-admin-is-slowly-dragging-us-to-war-in-ukraine/,N/A

“What disturbs me is that we’re not even having a debate about this,” he added. “The people who are calling for this escalation on the part of the West, of the U.S. and NATO allies, are not even acknowledging that there’s a risk involved. Just acknowledge that there’s a risk involved and then make a case for why it’s worth the risk.

“…And we can be tough with Putin, and we could’ve been tough with Putin about this and said, ‘Look, you’ll get Crimea and maybe these areas in eastern Ukraine as well, and in exchange for that you relinquish any claim to have influence over Ukraine or keep Ukraine in your orbit, and they are free to go their way.’ The outlines of a settlement, you can see — if anyone in the West had taken it seriously.”",https://thefederalist.com/videos/davidson-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-is-a-strategic-failure-for-the-u-s/,N/A
