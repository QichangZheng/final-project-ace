"At DHS, “Accountability” Is Just Another Word For Looking the Other Way","Five years ago, I was driving around Alexandria running errands for my then-fiancee (now my wife) when my car was wrecked by a power-hungry federal law enforcement official who threatened to arrest me and nearly pulled a gun on me. That agent, Angel Echevarria, was arrested in Florida late last month after he opened fire on a vehicle that allegedly cut him off. One of the occupants in the vehicle was a two-year-old child.

This is the story of an out-of-control federal agent, an agency which did nothing to restrain him despite being warned about his recklessly dangerous behavior, and an innocent child who could’ve died as a result of his actions and those of the criminally incompetent federal agency that to this day appears to still employ him.

On April 11, 2008, I was driving in the far right-hand lane of a four-lane divided road in northern Virginia, when an agent with the Federal Protective Service — an office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) — swerved his patrol car out of his lane and into the driver’s side of my car.

There was zero doubt as to who was at fault in the accident. The DHS agent clearly swerved out of his lane, which was stacked with cars waiting to turn left, and into my lane without looking. It’s an action we’ve all taken before, but unfortunately this time, the lane into which the officer swerved was occupied. By my car.

When I got out of my car to check on the other driver and assess the damage to my car, I assumed it would be a routine interaction. He would apologize, we’d exchange information, and we’d both be on our way.

But that’s not what happened. Instead, I was confronted by Angel Echevarria, an unhinged serial abuser of power who shouted at me, threatened to arrest me, and nearly pulled his gun on me. All for the apparent crime of driving next to him.

After Echevarria wrecked my car, I slowly got out of my car and asked him whether he was okay.

“Are you alright?” I asked. “NO,” he yelled. “What does it look like? My car is wrecked.”

“Well perhaps you should’ve stayed in your lane, then,” I replied.

“I had my blinker on!” he yelled.

“I don’t care if your whole car was blinking, you don’t just get to swerve out of your lane and smash other cars.”

I had no opportunity to view his allegedly activated blinker, seeing as how my car was a good five feet or so ahead of his when the collision happened (he ran his patrol car into the back portion of the driver’s side front door, causing extensive damage all the way to the rear panel of my car).

Was my response a bit much? Perhaps. But I had been minding my own business, doing my best to run errands before trying to catch a flight out of Reagan National that evening, only to have my car wrecked by an impatient officer who apparently thought his badge gave him the right to harass innocent citizens in order to cover up his own shoddy driving.

Echevarria then demanded that I provide him with my identification and proof of insurance, even though he had no jurisdiction over the matter and was, in fact, the reason for the car accident in the first place. I asked him to do the same and provide me with his I.D. and insurance. When he refused to even give me his name, I declined to provide him with my driver’s license given his behavior and previous outbursts. I knew my rights and I knew that as the person at fault, he had no legitimate authority to use his position to intimidate me. He again demanded my information, and I again declined until he provided the same to me.

At that point, Echevarria deliberately moved his hand to his holstered firearm and threatened to arrest me unless I provided him with my I.D. and proof of insurance. This was not because I was a threat (my friends regularly inform me that there’s no way I weigh more than “a buck twenty soaking wet”); it was because he wanted to use his position and his firearm to intimidate me into giving up my rights.

It is difficult to negotiate with a man whose only apparent source of courage is holstered to his waist.

I seriously considered allowing him to arrest me on principle. I knew I had done nothing wrong, and I also knew that the blatantly wrongful arrest of the then-chief investigator for a U.S. senator with oversight of DHS would make quite a news story. But I didn’t pull rank, because pulling rank is what immature, insecure, power-hungry fools do. Not once did I even so much as hint at my professional position.

Instead of using the same intimidation tactics as Echevarria or using my position as a bargaining chip, I gave up and gave in to his demands. At that point, despite not having any authority to do so, Echevarria ran a background check on me from his patrol car, using taxpayer resources to basically spy on me after wrecking my car. Unfortunately for Echevarria, a photographer for the Associated Press witnessed the entire incident and eagerly gave me his contact information.

When I noted to Echevarria that a witness observed the entire incident and that Echevarria was clearly at fault, he completely dismissed my claim and said, “Well, good for you. You found a witness. I’m proud of you.” Pro tip: if you’re a corrupt cop, don’t commit your crimes in front of reporters. Or maybe don’t commit crimes at all. That would be even easier.

When I returned to D.C. the next week, I immediately filed a very long and a very detailed complaint with the DHS inspector general’s (IG) office. An investigator from the IG came to my office and took a sworn affidavit from me.

“The actions of Mr. Echevarria made me feel threatened and gave me reason to believe that he would violate my personal freedoms and liberties in order to cover up the fact that he hit my car,” I wrote in my complaint. “I strongly believe that Mr. Echevarria used his position as an armed federal officer to intimidate me into giving up my rights and liberties.”

That was the last I ever heard from the IG. A couple of years later, when I filed a Freedom of Information Act request for all documents related to the IG’s investigation and any disciplinary actions taken against Echevarria as a result of the complaint, the office rejected my request.

Why? Because, they told me, it included personally identifiable information of the person who filed the complaint. That’s right, they rejected my document request because the documents I requested contained my personal information.

Now fast forward to September 7, 2013. According to the NBC affiliate in South Florida:

An off-duty Department of Homeland Security agent was arrested following a road rage incident in which he caught up to a car that had cut him off, pulled out his gun and shot the vehicle as it drove away, Boca Raton Police said.Angel Echevarria, 40, said the driver of the red Toyota struck him and his wife before he fired one round in front of a Nordstrom. He said he was trying to shoot out the tire of the car, according to a probable cause affidavit.A police officer wrote, however, that Echevarria, acting as a civilian, had no legal authority to fire his gun at an occupied vehicle.Police said he faces three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle for the Sept. 7 incident.

From the Florida Sun-Sentinel:

A Pompano Beach man whose car was allegedly shot at by an off-duty federal agent said Thursday it’s a “miracle” that nobody in the car — including his 2-year-old son — was hit by the bullet.Alla Juma, 27, said he thinks Boca Raton police did the right thing by initiating the arrest of Angel Echevarria, a Department of Homeland Security special agent assigned to the U.S. Marshals Service.[…]According to a Boca Raton police probable cause affidavit, Echevarria honked his horn at Juma’s car after Juma cut him off near the Town Center mall.In response, Juma shot up his middle finger. Officers wrote in the affidavit what happened next:Echevarria, driving with his wife and five children, tried to follow Juma’s red Toyota but crashed into the back of another car. Echevarria signaled to the other car to follow him into the mall parking lot. In the mall parking lot near the Nordstrom store, Echevarria saw Juma’s car and parked his black Honda Pilot nose-to-nose with it.The special agent, dressed in civilian clothes, got out of his car, pointed a .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun at Juma’s car, and announced he was a police officer.Echevarria said Juma sped away, bumping Echevarria and Echevarria’s wife as he drove off, according to the affidavit. The agent fired one round at the Toyota, police said, with the bullet lodging in the rear driver’s side wheel well.

Echevarria now faces three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm and one count of firing into an occupied vehicle. Under Florida’s mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, Echevarria faces at least 20 years in prison for each assault count if he is convicted.

For years, top DHS officials — including those working in the Secretary’s office — knew of Echevarria’s behavior, and yet they did nothing to mitigate the obvious danger that he posed to society. But the cover-ups didn’t stop there.

One Florida news site, BocaNewsNow.com, reported that DHS officials may have even attempted to cover up Echevarria’s arrest and hide it from the public (Echevarria was not recorded as having been arrested by Florida law enforcement until more than two weeks after the incident).

“Instead of turning himself into Boca Police,” the site reported, “Echevarria turned himself into fellow federal agents who may have ‘worked the system’ in a way to keep his arrest record hidden until BocaNewsNow.com demanded the information through a Freedom Of Information Act request.”

According to the site:

Boca Raton Police issued a warrant for Echevarria’s arrest. But Ecchevarria refused to deal with the Boca Raton Police Department, instead turning himself into his colleagues at the US Marshal’s Service. As BocaNewsNow.com reported exclusively, this kept his arrest information from being made public. The Palm Beach County jail booking system interprets an arrest by a federal agent as federal arrest — something that should only be released by federal officials. However, Echevarria was a county prisoner and the information should have been made public immediately, under Florida Statute 119. By turning himself into colleagues at the US Marshal’s service, Eschevarria appeared to be a federal prisoner.

And five years after an official complaint with the IG noted that Echevarria made wholly inappropriate moves to his firearm to intimidate one of Echevarria’s own victims, DHS allowed him to retain his firearm.

According to news accounts, it was his official service weapon that Echevarria fired at three unarmed vehicle occupants, one of whom was a two-year-old child.

In 2012, based on a Daily Caller article I wrote about the 2008 incident, I was contacted by a private investigator who claimed that Echevarria had been using his power as a federal law enforcement official to harass one of the investigator’s clients. The investigator wanted to know if I would be willing to testify in court about Echevarria’s history of abusing his power to intimidate people who got in his way (the matter was apparently solved out of court, as I was never summoned to testify).

How many other abuses of power did Echevarria commit that his superiors at DHS dutifully covered up? How many other lives may Echevarria have risked in a pathetic quest to prove his manhood? There is simply no way that I was the first person that Echevarria tried to intimidate into giving up his rights. How many young women or elderly citizens did he harass or assault before he was finally arrested? How many more people will he be allowed to victimize before society finally says “Enough!” and throws him in jail for good?

The Department of Homeland Security was created shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to protect Americans from future attacks. Given the tens of billions of dollars it’s received since its creation, it would be nice if the agency would take a little interest in protecting Americans from being attacked by its own incompetent, unhinged, and unstable personnel.

The Tyranny Of The Traffic Cop,"Friar Tuck: You thieving scandal!

Sheriff of Nottingham: Now, take it easy, Friar, I’m just doing my duty.

I remember the first time I heard N.W.A. I was a good little seventh grader, doing my homework and listening to the radio when “Gangsta Gangsta,” the edited version, came on. In that moment, my world changed. No longer was I a good little honor student; I was a good little honor student who listened to hardcore rap.

This presented challenges. Back in ‘88, one could not just download an album. One had to find a friend’s older sibling to loan you a cassette that you could then copy. I found my copy and soon enough I was jamming, quietly so as not to alert the parents, tracks like “F**k Tha Police.” Thus my worldview began to form.

Many things changed between 1988 and 2005, but my views on law enforcement remained firmly in the N.W.A. camp. Then I took a job shooting video for the local NBC affiliate and found myself regularly interacting with police officers. I had previously operated under the assumption that they were all vindictive cretins who lived to harass people. While interacting with cops here and there, my opinion changed. Sure, some of them were vindictive cretins, but many were stand-up guys. They liked to catch bad guys and help people who were genuinely in distress. And most, given enough time, which usually wasn’t much time, would even admit they hated writing traffic tickets. This roused my curiosity.

Traffic cops are usually not a starting point of policy discussions. But maybe they should be.

Traffic cops, though reviled, are usually not a starting point of policy discussions. We think “To Protect and Serve” and move on. But maybe they should be. Police should not reside above us; they exist on our dime to help maintain order. Increasingly, they are not members of the community and thus not invested in fomenting a sense of community. They are enforcers to whom we have little recourse. As they are not too pervasive nor too invasive, we tolerate them.

But should we?

Everyone has a story

I’ve long counted myself as the Mark McGwire of speeding. I cannot count the number of times I have whizzed by speed traps at alarming speeds without being pulled over – the secret is to do it without compunction, to never tap your breaks when you see the officer lying in wait. But my friends and family in other places share very different stories.

One friend was pulled over because the cop thought his headlights were too bright — thank you, xenon bulbs – and decided that warranted a quick check to make sure the driver was sober.

I’ve long counted myself as the Mark McGwire of speeding.

My father was once stopped by police (from the same force that recently made headlines for a slight lack of restraint with regard to shooting a 107-year-old man to death) for turning around at a railroad crossing rather than waiting for a long train, just leaving the yard, to get up to speed and move down the tracks. On another occasion, this time in Damascus, Arkansas, he was stopped for speeding and told if he paid promptly that the offense would not go on his record.

One uncle was stopped for driving the right way down a street that had been temporarily converted to a one-way for an annual festival. Another uncle regularly travels through an intersection with a traffic light and a 15-mph speed limit. More often than not, there is an officer observing that intersection for infractions such as an individual taking his vehicle above idling speed to make it through the light. A friend once had her car searched after her husband was stopped for speeding because she “looked like she was hiding something.” She mused that it turns out slouching is bad for you.

Some years ago, friends of mine embarked on a trip to New Orleans in two vehicles. Alas, one of the crew was not the most cautious of fellows. Upon arriving in the Big Easy, he was quite careless with the keys and left them dangling from the trunk. The trunk of the car the keys belonged to. Parked in downtown New Orleans. That was the last they saw of the vehicle. Thus my friends found themselves facing a conundrum. There were seven of them and there was one car. They had to get home. They did not have the disposable income for a rental. They did not have the disposable income for a plane ticket. Being college kids, they had not filled the trunk with luggage.

Everything was going swimmingly until the trunk rider was spotted reentering his “seat” at a rest stop. Then the full force of the law was unleashed, my friends were pulled over, explanations were offered, and a hearty laugh was shared by all. I am sure they could have been cited for some sort of violation. Perhaps the officers simply were not in the mood to think creatively about the situation.

“How can you do this?” she asked. “I can loosen the cuffs,” Barney replied.

Another friend, let’s call her Amity, was in a bad spot in life. She was leaving an abusive relationship. It was the summer of 1999. It was hot. Her air conditioner was broken. She was on a rural highway and no other cars were around. Seeking relief from the heat, she removed her bra. That is when Barney appeared and noticed Amity had a busted headlight. Amity was driving at night, in the heat, and not wearing a bra. Obviously, she was a prostitute. I’m not kidding. That’s seriously what the cop suggested.

What’s worse is that the cop, whom she knew and who knew her situation, cuffed and stuffed her and off they took down the country roads, windows down, bugs flying in and covering Amity. “How can you do this?” she asked. “I can loosen the cuffs,” Barney replied.

When they arrived at the jail, there were no female officers present. Rather than follow precedent and wait for one to properly process Amity, Barney threatened to throw her in with the male population. He relented, but she still found herself detained, without immediate recourse, for a broken headlight and a completely understandable decision regarding undergarments that was, frankly, none of the cop’s business.

Amity was never charged, though she did shell out $958 for the stop. All in all, she was relatively lucky. Things could have gone worse.

Though I have avoided ever being ensnared by a speed trap, I am not as good at avoiding minor interactions with traffic patrols. I have been officially warned for driving on the shoulder. I was scolded for texting while driving. That I was at a red light changing songs on my phone and not actually texting likely helped my cause. The officer in the well-marked vehicle next to me looked over and shook his head. I rolled down my window and he said, “No texting while driving.” “I’m not texting, I’m changing songs.” “It’s the same thing.” “Okay, man.”

To serve and protect? Or generate revenue?

In a 2009 interview, James Poulos discussed what he refers to as the “Pink Police State:”

So citizens of a Pink Police State (I should say subjects) are apt to surrender more and more political liberty in exchange for more and more cultural or ‘personal’ license. And the government of a Pink Police State tends to monopolize and totalize administrative control while carving out a permissive playpen for the people.

We tolerate an increasingly omnipresent force that exists not to protect the general welfare or guarantee liberty, in any sense of the word, but to generate revenue. Moreover, that force does not even grant us the liberty of a permissive playpen. In the United States, there is no autobahn.

But the America of Andy Griffith is no more; now we have Barney Fife reborn as the Sheriff of Nottingham, armed with pen and pad, and he is collecting gold, beautiful gold, for the state. He is invasive, but not too invasive. He is pervasive, but not too pervasive. Mostly he is just a nuisance. You are stopped, you listen to the speech, and you may or not find your wallet lighter at the end.

A few years ago, ABC News’ 20/20 program looked at the traffic ticket situation in the city of Warren, Michigan. Turns out a lot of traffic tickets were being written. And many of them came from the same police officer – David Kanapsky.

Anyone who’s been in traffic court can attest that judges usually find the testimony of police officers to be credible. But the 20/20 investigation revealed that the more tickets Kanapsky wrote, the more overtime he got. The previous year he’d been able to increase his pay by $21,000.

That year the town had made half a million dollars in traffic fines. Some drivers told ABC News that the whole thing seemed like “a moneymaking scam.”

Indeed. Such ticket-writing operations only work if police officers have tons of laws to enforce. Speed limits of 15 miles-per-hour may be ridiculously impossible to meet, but they will earn jurisdictions some nice additional revenue.

As the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said, “The more prohibitions there are, the poorer the people will be. The more laws are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits there will be.”

We do not exist at the whim of government. Government exists with our consent.

It’s also true that these ticket-writing operations only work if police officers are encouraged to enforce those laws without common sense. Failing to stop at a stop sign when someone else is going through an intersection is dangerous. Rolling through a stop sign when no one else is going through the intersection is not. It saves gas and it saves time. When 20/20 surreptitiously videotaped people stopping at stop signs, the vast majority of drivers in Michigan and New York rolled right on through.

And when Warren changed one of the stop signs where Kanapsky wrote many of his tickets to a yield sign, car accidents actually went way down.

What is it about traffic cops that angries up my blood so? It’s this – we do not exist at the whim of government. Government exists with our consent. There is a focus on the large items, the issues which exemplify the distance between bureaucracy and our neighborhoods; the issues that inflame our passions. But why do we value our friends, our neighborhoods?

We value them because they are not faceless authorities subjecting us to their whims, carving out for us a playpen in which we can exercise our approved freedoms. We value them because there is an agreed upon purpose, a shared goal. And that goal is not plugging holes in the budget.

We are not a nation of laws. We are a nation of men who consent to be governed by laws. We consent to be governed by traffic laws, but there is an assumption. That assumption is that traffic laws are objective measurements based on common sense. As evidenced by the money collected and the stories told, that is not the case.

Long ago, a group of determined colonists decided they were done with taxation without representation and the United States was born. She was born without a king. As such, Prince John cannot exist unless we allow him to. By permitting traffic cops, those Sheriffs of Nottingham, extreme leeway and authority, we enable a multitude of Prince Johns. They are focused. They are hungry. They want gold, delicious gold, and have found a way to collect it without appealing directly to the taxpayers. We may no longer be colonists, but we do not have to tolerate it. The sheriffs can only do their duty if we sanction it. Maybe N.W.A. was correct. Maybe we as a nation should not yearn to sing “Kumbaya” but instead join voices in a rousing sing-along of “F**k Tha Police.”

Bill De Blasio’s Law Enforcement Racket,"Is Bill de Blasio about to take New York City’s public safety back to the bad old days of rampant street crime and murder – or is he, like President Obama, mostly just slapping a new coat of rhetorical paint over largely unchanged security policies?

The jury is still out, especially on the impact of a federal court decree that could yet hamstring the NYPD. But early indications suggest that de Blasio’s Police Commissioner, William Bratton, is determined to keep in place the core of the “stop and frisk” policies that de Blasio campaigned against – policies whose foremost national advocate is none other than Bratton himself. Mayor de Blasio’s fans and critics alike may have to grapple with the possibility that a lot less is going to change than his racially charged anti-law-enforcement campaign would suggest.

Mugged By History

Back in the pre-Giuliani days when muggings were a constant daily threat throughout New York City, they used to say that a conservative was just a liberal who had been mugged, and the City’s political history bears that out. After enduring three decades of rising rates of street crime and violence, New Yorkers finally rebelled in 1993, booting David Dinkins from office in favor of Rudy Giuliani, the most conservative mayor of the City in modern times.

As befits elections that determined the course of the City’s future safety and prosperity, the 1989 and 1993 Giuliani-Dinkins races engaged a far higher proportion of the city’s population than any election before or since – Rudy got 120,000 more votes in losing the 1989 election than de Blasio did in winning a landslide in 2013 in which less than 15% of New Yorkers voted:

That political reality can’t be lost on de Blasio: while national Democrats like Obama may fairly claim to have brought new voters into the process, de Blasio won on a tide of indifference and low turnout, and even in a city where Democrats have an 8-1 registration advantage (likely to grow after the devastation visited on Staten Island by 2012’s Hurricane Sandy), he needs to keep the sleeping giant of single-issue anti-crime voters (many of whom are fairly liberal on other issues) from reawakening.

For the moment, it’s held at bay by amnesia and complacency. Most of today’s progressives – most of New York’s voters, in fact – don’t remember the Dinkins years. Besides the 11% of voters under 30 in the 2013 election, there’s the fact that roughly a million of the city’s three million immigrants arrived since 2000, meaning that around 10% of New Yorkers only came to the United States since Mike Bloomberg became the Mayor. With that level of population turnover, New York lacks the collective memory to be alarmed, yet, by de Blasio’s rhetoric. But results are another matter.

Broken Windows: The NYPD in the 1990s

It’s hard to argue with the results that the Giuliani and Bloomberg Administrations achieved in New York, although a few die-hard Dinkins partisans – chief among them de Blasio, a former Dinkins aide married to another former Dinkins aide – argue that some of the credit should go to Dinkins himself for beginning the process of expanding the NYPD’s street presence.

Giuliani’s first Police Commissioner had actually served under Dinkins: Bratton had been Dinkins’ head of the Transit Police before moving to Boston to become Police Commissioner. And Dinkins’ own Police Commissioner, Lee Brown, had already begun implementing new ideas about “community policing” that required a more aggressive presence on the streets of high-crime neighborhoods, ideas that were expanded when Dinkins replaced Brown in 1992 with Ray Kelly (the same Ray Kelly who was the target of many of de Blasio’s barbs in his more recent tenure heading the NYPD). The idea that more patrolmen would have more interactions with the populace was already taking hold even before Rudy took office.

In 1994, Rudy brought back Bratton, naming him as Kelly’s successor to run the NYPD. Giuliani and Bratton brought the critical elements to the table that the Dinkins-Brown and even Dinkins-Kelly teams had lacked. The NYPD, from Bratton down to the ordinary beat cop, knew the Mayor was on their side even when they came under criticism – a major morale booster that had been lacking under the weak, ineffectual Dinkins, whose first instinct was always to pander to the Al Sharptons of the New York street. The new team brought an intense, demanding focus to restoring order (Brown, by contrast, had been nicknamed “Out of Town Brown” by the cops and the tabloids). They marshalled increasingly detailed data: the CompStat system, first developed by the Transit Police under Bratton, was rolled out city-wide, enabling the NYPD to track crime on a more detailed, weekly precinct-by-precinct and neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis and hold precinct commanders accountable for results. They put a social-science theory into practice as well: the NYPD went after low-level “lifestyle” street offenders like squeegee men, building on James Q. Wilson and George Kelling’s “broken windows” theory of how social disorder encourages crime. And at the core of this process, where the rubber met the road, was the day-to-day activity of cops patrolling dangerous, crime-ridden neighborhoods and taking a proactive approach to threats by stopping and frisking people who looked suspicious – never an error-free process but one that resulted in scores of arrests of criminals carrying illegal guns and drugs. In a real sense, Bratton earned the title of “the father of stop and frisk,” which he also later expanded in his tenure heading the LAPD from 2002-09.

The results in New York could hardly have been more dramatic – arguably the greatest success story of any domestic public policy initiative of the past half-century. The murder rate dropped by 70% from the high watermark of 2,245 murders in 1990, the worst of the Dinkins years. And the improvements in the crime rate went well beyond the headline homicide rate. As an NBER study observed:

During the 1990s, crime rates in New York City dropped dramatically, even more than in the United States as a whole. Violent crime declined by more than 56 percent in the City, compared to about 28 percent in the nation as whole. Property crimes tumbled by about 65 percent, but fell only 26 percent nationally….Over the 1990s, misdemeanor arrests increased 70 percent in New York City. When arrests for misdemeanors had risen by 10 percent, indicating increased use of the “broken windows” method, robberies dropped 2.5 to 3.2 percent, and motor vehicle theft declined by 1.6 to 2.1 percent.

Rudy was a revolutionary change-agent figure in New York, with a revolutionary personality; his abrasive, hard-charging style was a necessary element of his success, but it made him many enemies, and the magnitude of his success made him eager to claim the credit. And that led him into inevitable personality conflict with Bratton, himself an outsize personality who wanted his share of the limelight. Bratton left office abruptly in March 1996 after Giuliani ordered an investigation into a book deal Bratton had signed. Great success in fighting crime, but also controversies and the overshadowing tragedy of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, would follow throughout Giuliani’s remaining six years in office. It would take his departure from office to allow his successes to be institutionalized and separated from his personality.

Operation Impact: The Bloomberg Years

The Bloomberg years seemed, for a while, to put the frictions of the Giuliani era behind the City; far from a crusading radical overturning the status quo, Bloomberg was by both temperament and circumstance a manager who inherited a City already pointed in the right direction and had the more prosaic task of making it run more efficiently. And for the most part, in the area of law enforcement, he did; the major crime rate continued to plunge to improbably low levels, even through the economic hard times that followed the 2008 financial crisis – rapes down by a third, burglaries dropped in half, car thefts down more than 75%. By 2013, Bloomberg and Ray Kelly (who served as Police Commissioner for the entire duration of Bloomberg’s 12-year tenure) could boast:

[N]ew all-time lows will be set in 2013 for the fewest homicides and fewest shootings in recorded city history. There have been 332 homicides so far this year, which is a reduction of 20 percent from the previous record low, which was established last year – and homicides have fallen nearly 50 percent since 2001. Similarly, the number of shootings have fallen by 20 percent from last year’s record low – with 1,093 shootings through Thursday, December 26th – down from 1,608 in 2001, a 32 percent reduction. Overall crime is now down 32 percent since 2001.

That success story bucked the national trend, which saw crime rates bounce back in many places after the policing revolution of the 1990s, and took place at a time when an increasing share of the NYPD’s resources were being redirected to anti-terrorism work. But the primary goal of maintaining order brought tension with Bloomberg’s continuing struggle to control the City’s budget. In 2003, Kelly launched “Operation Impact,” a plan to flood “impact zones” of high crime with patrol officers; the program was expanded in 2004 after producing sharp reductions in crime in the impact zones, and was doubled to more than 1,800 officers in 2007, about 5% of the whole Department. But the program relied on the ground-level work being done by raw recruits straight out of the police academy, leading left-wing critics to argue that it led to “officer burnout and overly aggressive tactics.” The 2008 financial crisis took a huge bite out of the City’s budget in Bloomberg’s third term, and even the NYPD wasn’t safe. Bloomberg pressed in 2010 and 2011 for cuts in the police force, and while he ultimately backed off the most aggressive plans, the NYPD ended his term as a shrinking share of the City’s government:

There are now roughly 34,500 cops on the beat, about the same number as there were in 1992 when the city was besieged by crime and down from 37,000 in 2002 when Bloomberg took office.



But the city’s overall workforce has grown, There are now roughly 271,000 full-time employees on the city payroll, up 10 percent from 247,000 in 2002…



…[T]he NYPD is facing an unprecedented wave of 10,000 retirements in the next three years. These are cops hired 20 years ago under the “Safe Cities, Safe Streets” program, which was hastily ordered in 1992 by then-Mayor David Dinkins and the City Council to combat a tidal wave of crime that gripped the city.

The tension between keeping a lid on the NYPD’s budget and maintaining its aggressive presence on the streets was balanced by putting the heaviest burden of policing on the least expensive, least experienced members of the Force. Unless deeper cuts could be made to other parts of the City’s enormous government, the new Mayor would have to decide if that balance should be reconsidered.

Why Bratton?

Given that de Blasio had run so hard to the Left during the election against “racial profiling” and promised to drop the City’s appeal of a federal court ruling that its “stop-and-frisk” policy was racially discriminatory, his decision to bring back Bratton seems more than a little puzzling at first glance. In 2006, Bratton co-wrote a strongly-worded defense of “broken windows” policing in National Review Online, blasting “ivory-tower academics” who “have never sat in a patrol car, walked or bicycled a beat, lived in or visited regularly troubled violent neighborhoods, or collected any relevant data of their own ‘on the ground’.” He has been critical of cities that “made the mistake of embracing” Occupy Wall Street. And Bratton remains a vocal defender of stop-and-frisk:

Bratton is an ardent supporter of the policy because he says it’s an effective means of reducing crime on the street. Last year, he even compared stop-and-frisk as a solution to crime to “chemotherapy” as a treatment for cancer. In an interview …with NPR, Bratton hinted that the policy would be an effective crime-fighting tool in Oakland.

Bratton defended stop-and-frisk as “essential,” and in a May 2013 interview with Jeffrey Toobin, before de Blasio’s emergence as a serious candidate, Bratton bluntly suggested that stop-and-frisk critics didn’t know what they were talking about:

“First off, stop-question-and-frisk has been around forever,” he told me. “It is known by stop-and-frisk in New York, but other cities describe it other ways, like stop-question-and-frisk or Terry stops. It’s based on a Supreme Court case from 1968, Terry v. Ohio, which focussed very significantly on it. Stop-and-frisk is such a basic tool of policing. It’s one of the most fundamental practices in American policing. If cops are not doing stop-and-frisk, they are not doing their jobs. It is a basic, fundamental tool of police work in the whole country. If you do away with stop-and-frisk, this city will go down the chute as fast as anything you can imagine.”



We also discussed the current controversy over stop-and-frisk under Raymond Kelly, Bloomberg’s Police Commissioner. “What you have right now is a controversy in which nobody really understands what they are fighting about,” Bratton said. “Stop-and-frisk is not a tool solely to look for guns. Unfortunately, both the Mayor and the Police Commissioner refer to it that way, and that’s a problem because so few guns are recovered. But so what? The vast majority of stops are for a wide variety of things. Is someone drinking a can of beer on the corner? You want to stop that behavior. If somebody is aggressively panhandling on the street, urinating against a building. Is there somebody that you suspect is casing a building? Or is that two guys just locked out of their apartment? Police officers notice what may be a burglary. Of course they should be noticing and investigating. There are countless examples of what you want police to do.”

Bratton’s tenure at the LAPD copied his approach in New York:

When Bratton led the LAPD, the department’s use of stop and frisk expanded significantly. In 2002, cops made 587,200 stops, and by 2008, they made 875,204 stops, an increase of 49 percent…

Critics noted that “[w]ell over 70 percent of 2008 LAPD stops in inner-city precincts were of African-American and Latinos, a ratio[] similar to New York’s.” Bratton’s LAPD stopped a lot more minorities – but also improved the accuracy of its stops:

The LAPD’s improved image coincided…with a 49% spike in stops of pedestrians and motorists from 2002 to 2008, according to a Harvard Kennedy School report. Blacks comprised 9% of the city’s population but accounted for 23% of all those stopped. Over the same period the number of stops which led to arrests doubled from 15% to 30%, suggesting the police tended to have good reason.

And yet, Bratton succeeded in greatly improving the LAPD’s relationship with the city’s minority population. He did that, in large part, not by backing down from aggressive policing but by old-fashioned community-relations outreach:

Even before formally taking over a police department scarred by race riots, corruption and brutality, Bratton sought out black leaders like John Mack, then head of the Los Angeles Urban League, and civil rights attorney Connie Rice. Rice warned she would sue him, as she did his predecessors, but he invited her to help him reform a force still tainted by the beating of Rodney King.



“He co-opted us, and he co-opted us into the mission of … the cultural transformation of LAPD,” she told the Los Angeles Times.

Bratton also recruited many more Hispanic police officers. One result of Bratton’s diplomatic outreach was that, at the end of his tenure in 2009, a federal court lifted a consent decree imposed in 2001.

There are various theories as to why de Blasio would bring back a Police Commissioner from the Giuliani era with such a long track record of promoting the very thing de Blasio claimed to oppose. One is that de Blasio was pressured into the pick by New York’s wealthy, liberal Democratic power brokers and bankrollers, who remain more important to his party than outraged leftists who regarded the appointment as a sellout – indeed, de Blasio just appointed a new head of the City Planning Commission whose experience is in gentrifying and Disneyfying Times Square, hardly a Left-populist move. Another is that he was more or less mugged by reality – once he knew he would be held responsible for keeping the City safe, he was forced (like Obama) to stop posturing and grow up. A third possibility is that de Blasio’s Dinkins partisanship is asserting itself, intent on showing that Bratton, not Rudy, should be given the credit for the City’s turnaround. Finally, there’s the possibility that de Blasio – an admirer of Daniel Ortega who honeymooned in Castro’s Cuba and voted to honor Robert Mugabe – isn’t really any sort of civil libertarian at heart, and wants a strong police force to carry out the sort of expanded government powers he craves.

Stop and Frisk is Dead…Long Live Stop and Frisk?

Whatever de Blasio’s motives, the solution that Bratton proposes is, in effect, to continue Operation Impact but replace its pairs of rookies with more experienced (and, by necessity, more expensive) cops:

The changes could include pairing rookies with veteran officers in local precincts and providing a broader training regimen, Mr. Bratton said. New officers may be assigned to radio cars before they are placed on the streets in high-crime neighborhoods, he said.



“Operation impact is not going away. I would hope to potentially expand it using seasoned officers,” Mr. Bratton said during a news conference at police headquarters. “The concern I have right now is that you have 10 or 12 of them assigned to one supervisor. I want to give these kids a much better training opportunity.”

Bratton is promising to reach out to Sharpton and others of his ilk, and is selling the new approach as a focus on a more targeted population of suspects:

He said instead of going after the “general population,” his cops will go after the “known criminal population” of a community. “In Los Angeles, we had a database of 40,000 known gang members,” he says. “We focused on them rather than good kids on the way home from school or work. We stop, questioned and frisked and often arrested those career criminals.

He’s also been making this pitch to the legal community. The police union is, unsurprisingly, pleased with Bratton’s approach:

The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association president, Patrick Lynch, released a statement saying the move is “consistent with the union’s philosophy of training” and that “Using rookies to meet numbered targets under the former system resulted in many of the problems we are now in the process of solving.”

This leaves the question of where – given his many other ambitions for New York City government and the many demands he will face from the teachers and other public employee unions – de Blasio will get the money to pay for this. It also leaves unanswered whether de Blasio’s supporters, who believed he was striking a decisive blow against what they regarded as a racist system, will be satisfied four years from now that law enforcement in the City has changed in a way they consider meaningful.

A Thousand Cuts

That’s the optimistic scenario – well, optimistic if you want the NYPD to keep its focus on improving its winning law enforcement formula rather than scrapping it for purposes of political pandering. But if the arrival of Bratton and his plans to preserve the core of stop-and-frisk and Operation Impact represent continuity, there are still ways in which the City’s hard-won progress could be placed at risk by the new Mayor.

The immediate risk arises from de Blasio’s decision to drop the City’s appeal of a federal district court decision holding the existing stop-and-frisk policies to be racially discriminatory. Mayor de Blasio didn’t drop the appeal because he feared losing – the City already won the first round when the Second Circuit stayed the order and removed the district judge from the case. Rather, he dropped the appeal because he was afraid the City would win. The New York Post’s Bob McManus notes some of the consequences of this and related decisions:

The NYPD shortly will be under the supervision of a court-appointed federal monitor; this will last at least three years, and probably much longer — with all that implies for the command integrity and personnel accountability central to the Giuliani-Bloomberg anti-crime successes.



The department also will soon be answering to a municipal inspector general, thanks to the City Council.



And cops are being targeted for personal liability, in court, for so-called “racial profiling” transgressions — whatever that term even means.

As Heather MacDonald, a long-time defender of proactive policing, explains:

The least of the opinion’s problems is the unnecessary bureaucracy it inflicts on the NYPD, including a federal monitor, burdensome reporting requirements, and left-wing advisory panels, all overseen by the plaintiffs’ attorneys. The most serious problem is [the district court’s] statistical test of racial profiling, which compares police stops to population data, rather than crime data.

The roster of members of that advisory panel, stocked with believers in Critical Race Theory and other race obsessives, should send a chill down the spine of anyone who expects the NYPD to get a fair hearing. Co-opting them, and getting the City out from under this decree, may prove a more difficult diplomatic task for Bratton even than he faced in Los Angeles.

The real risk to law enforcement is thus not that Bratton’s NYPD will turn its back on stop-and-frisk, but that it will suffer death by a thousand cuts from intrusive oversight boards and loss of morale among patrol cops. The Daily News notes that “City cops stopped little more than 3,000 people in January, a far cry from the 50,000-people monthly tallies that were once commonplace under Kelly’s leadership” – a significant falloff, albeit one that is no doubt partly attributable to emptier streets in the bitter weather of the past month. And the biggest imponderable of all in morale is the new Mayor himself: one only need wait for the next controversy (in a city where 34,000 cops patrol 8.3 million people, a lot can happen and it usually does) to see whether he sends the cops the expected signal that City Hall doesn’t have their back in a pinch.

The Beat

New York City isn’t like anywhere else in the United States. One recent study of “high density population” – people living in densities of over 10,000 people per square mile – found that 43.3% of Americans living in areas that dense live in New York:

If you look at people living at the higher density of 25,000 per square mile, New York sticks out even further:

The advantage of high density is that it allows economies of scale in policing – New York not only has twice as many police per resident as Los Angeles, it can concentrate them in much smaller areas, making it a lot harder to hide from the cops. This is, in fact, the argument for why New Yorkers don’t need to own guns: there are already lots of guns on the street everywhere you turn, in the hands of officers of the law. With a large, densely concentrated police force on hand, New York has gone further down the road than anywhere else in the country in accepting the security state in exchange for keeping violence at bay. Mayor de Blasio’s decision to bring back William Bratton and retain the core of stop-and-frisk suggests that it will be harder than de Blasio’s supporters think to unsettle that bargain. But the proof of whether they can undermine it indirectly from the shadows of bureaucracy, and whether that costs the City its hard-won gains, will be told in the CompStat reports and body counts of the next four years.

How To Explain What’s Happened In Ukraine To Your Friends,"Over the last week, Ukraine became a whole different country – politically and, one might say, mentally. The protests that have been going on in the nation’s capital, Kyiv, as well as over the country, for three months, resulted in the president being ousted from his post. However, this achievement came at a great cost: More than 80 people died during the last few days, and many are still fighting for their lives in hospitals. What caused this uprising and how the protesters managed to change the situation is explained shortly here.

What drove people to the streets?

The protests were triggered in late November of 2013 by the fact that the Ukrainian government refused to sign an agreement with the European Union (EU), which would facilitate trade between Ukraine and the European countries and make economic processes in Ukraine more transparent. This agreement had been anticipated by Ukrainian business and citizens alike as a chance to save struggling economy and as an opening to a possible membership in the European Union in the future. Being abruptly denied this opportunity, people gathered for a rally on Kyiv’s central Independence square or, as it is named in Ukrainian, the Maidan. And the protests that started off since have been dubbed “the Euromaidan.”

How did it all turn so violent?

Protests began as a peaceful demonstration demanding the resignation of the cabinet of ministers who failed to secure the European treaty, with middle class and students being the basic group of participants. The rallies, however, were not successful and looked likely to end without bringing any significant change. But then one night, riot police attacked the people at the square and cruelly beat them. Next morning, with videos of police brutality going viral, more people joined the protesters. After another attack of riot police mere days after that, one could find hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians from all over the country protesting in Kyiv. In other big cities, protests were happening, too, some of them resulting in the occupying of regional administrations.

What was the response of the government?

The pro-presidential political party that held the majority of seats in Ukrainian parliament reacted with passing of a number of laws criminalizing protest activity in mid-January 2014. Rigging the votes to get the laws adopted, the ruling party MPs made it illegal to go on a rally, to set up a protest tent, to occupy governmental buildings, and to publish articles discussing unlawful actions of public officials. From unprecedented limits on international NGOs to absurd prohibitions on wearing a helmet and having more than 5 cars in a row on streets (‘Yay, no more traffic jams!’, Ukrainians commented with sarcasm), the new rules, named “dictatorship laws,” were aimed to curb the protests.

Did it work?

Actually, people reacted with even bigger demonstrations, escalating in clashes with riot police. Police killed two protesters with guns. One of the protesters died of wounds, and another was found frozen to death in a forest after being kidnapped and tortured. Several protest leaders fled abroad. One of them, a leader of the protest-on-wheels group known as the Automaidan, was transported to get treatment in Europe after being abducted and tortured into saying he was a US spy. Many activists were arrested with possible prison terms ranging from 8 to 15 years. This pushed government and the opposition to negotiations. After the loss of lives and police atrocities, new faces in the same system was not enough. Protesters demanded resignation of the president and a change of Ukrainian constitution, which would take away central powers from the president.

Did the government meet the demands?

On the 18th of February, a parliamentary session was scheduled that was supposed to introduce the negotiated changes to the constitution. However, the pro-presidential party refused to address this issue during the session. After that, the protesters stormed police cordons and some of them were killed. Protesters were pushed back to the central square, where the clashes continued. During the next two days, as clashes ended and the protesters were trying to restore the barricades, more than 70 people were killed by snipers, the riot police and hired thugs that cooperated with the police. The victims did not hold firearms and some were without protective vests. And several wounded protesters are reported to have died in a fire that consumed a building near the Independence square.

The tragic losses and murder orders prompted some pro-presidential MPs to join the opposition in voting for cease-fire decree in the parliament. A new majority with more ruling party MPs adding to its numbers voted for the changes to the constitution that made the president less powerful. A treaty was signed between the president and the oppositional leadership that sought to ban riot police from using guns and to set up early elections at the end of this year. Protesters, however, did not agree with the president being in office for another 9 months. A leader of one of self-defense paramilitary groups made an ultimatum for the president: if he does not resign, protesters will storm his private residence. Over the next couple of hours, the president left Kyiv, and the parliament set the date of next presidential elections on the 25th of May 2014.

What is happening now?

Current whereabouts of the former president are unknown. Meanwhile, the parliament passed the laws allowing release of political prisoners, one of whom is the former prime minister. Local conflicts continue in several cities. In Sevastopol, a city in Crimea that has a special status due to hosting a Russian navy base, there has been a rally that refused to recognize the local city government and elected a Russian citizen as an alternative head of city administration. A video of Russian armored vehicles in Crimea has appeared. The Russian Federation has not yet recognized current Ukrainian government.

What has been the role of international community in Ukrainian events?

Different countries and international organizations, such as the United Nations and the European parliament, called for peace and justice in Ukraine. Diplomatic representatives of the USA and the EU were present in Ukraine during the protests warning against the use of force against the protesters. Poland and Lithuania let in wounded Ukrainian protesters to receive medical treatment. Russia’s role has influenced the protests, too. First, a $15 billion loan suggested by Russia was the alternative that the Ukrainian government chose instead of the agreement with the EU. Second, more billions were promised to Ukraine before the biggest crackdown of the protests that involved mass killings. However, Russia revoked this offer after the resignation of the president, citing the absence of a new government as a reason.

Who are the people that went out on the protests?

People from different geographical regions of Ukraine and social groups took part in the protests. Sociological survey held at the beginning of February showed that 88 percent of those who continuously took part in the Euromaidan, were men, and women comprised 12 percent. More than half of all of them belonged to the 30-54 years age group, and 44 percent represented middle class – professionals and private entrepreneurs.

The New Social Divide Within The Pink Police State,"Read part one of this series here.

Americans dimly grasp that the new American regime has jettisoned the venerable public-private divide at the heart of classical liberalism. But most of us remain in the dark about what exactly is taking its place.

Despite the avalanche of regulations, rules, and guidance issued by our state and federal governments, no official—elected or otherwise—has done for Americans what President Dwight Eisenhower did in his farewell remarks on the military-industrial complex. Eisenhower was the last president to speak to us (much less warn us!) about the changing character of the American regime.

Today, it is perhaps too much to ask a president to do the same. Eisenhower was intimately familiar with America’s military and civilian bureaucracy. He recognized how a “scientific technological elite” could use both branches of federal organization to make “public policy” its “captive.” Which presumptive occupant of the White House has such a sweeping, personal grasp of the new officialdom—yet opposes it enough to bear witness?

From Making Things to Making Emotions

Today, the public policy elite has captured the very idea of public policy. Far exceeding the bounds of the old regime—the industrial, managerial, and male-yet-sterile form of rule portrayed by The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit—today’s elite has superseded the 21st-century logics of industry, management, and, perhaps most importantly, of the neutral or neutered male intellect first attributed to proper social science by Max Weber.

The logic of industry required men to fill factories and work in linear fashion to construct machines. The new logic of officialdom requires men and women—or boys and girls, depending on where we date the onset of maturity—to work in hive fashion to deconstruct, and sometimes rearrange, knowledge.

The logic of management required men with seniority to train, supervise, mentor, reward, and promote younger men, adopting a system patterned on the military. The new logic of officialdom requires men and women—or, again, boys and girls—to organize “human resources” around setting and meeting corporate goals, which are as likely to prioritize the symbolic performance of identity as they are the pursuit of profit.

As Matthew Crawford explained in Shop Class as Soulcraft, the touchy-feely panopticon of the “knowledge work” industry is equally in the business of emotion work:

in the last thirty years American businesses have shifted their focus from the production of goods (now done elsewhere) to the production of brands, that is, states of mind of the consumer, and the shift finds its correlate in the production of mentalities in workers. Process becomes more important that product, and is to be optimized by management techniques that work on a deeper level than the curses of a foreman. Further, though the demands made on workers are invariably justified in terms of their contributions to the bottom line, in fact such calculations are difficult to make; the chain of means-ends reasoning becomes opaque, and this opens the way for work to become a rather moralistic place. […] In the contemporary office, the whole person is at issue, rather than a narrow set of competencies.

From Sexless Male Rationality to Sexless Female Therapy

The logic of neutral male rationality, gendered but sexless, has given way to the logic of therapeutic administration—prefigured by Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. Big Nurse, as she’s otherwise known, is a transitional figure between the old American regime and the new. A former Army nurse, Ratched is machine-like, robotic, bent on total control and orthogonal order. In that sense, she still inhabits the world of unsexed, male-gendered rationalism. But that should not mask the sea change that Ken Kesey detected. Goethe, as Philip Rieff reminds us, considered it “a fact that humanity will ultimately triumph”; he only feared, however, “that at the same time the world will become one great hospital in which one man will be the other’s humane nurse.” Social order, Goethe predicted, would become more female in gender; but in its rationalization and universalization, it would become female in an unsexed way. In place of the old regime’s male-gendered rule, defined by its figurative sterility, the new officialdom gives us female-gendered rule—defined by its figurative barrenness.

Nurse Ratched is a transitional figure between the old American regime and the new.

That is in stark contrast to the political maternalism that arose in America to reform the abuses and excesses of the sterile, male industrial age. As Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam put it in a pivotal passage within Grand New Party, “a small clique of highly educated women, which included pioneers in the social sciences and social work,” refused to surrender their moral identity to industrial rationality. These so-called maternalists “saw the slow, steady disintegration of the American family under radically new economic conditions as the central challenge of their time. They condemned Big Business’s efforts to efface and undermine the value of domestic work as the entering wedge of a broader campaign to reduce self-reliant citizens to mere consumers and clients.”

Today, in the new officialdom, this position is completely reversed. The most forceful strain of female-gendered political thought embraces postindustrial corporatism and condemns the economics of domesticity. To be sure, the ardent appreciation for birth control in the sick-dangerous realm, outside the precincts of health-and-safety regulation, betokens a mischievous sort of fearful admiration for the ultimate in deranged risk: conceiving a child not only out of wedlock but outside of love and even out of “like.”

Within the realm of health and safety, however, the mania for birth control is of a strikingly different quality. Rather than demanding consumption, it demands production; rather than a license to access the realm of transgression in which nothing is ever completely supervised or completely predictable, it is an ideological mandate to enforce healthy and safe conduct among the ruled, right down to the most intimate details and choices of their lives.

Now for Something Completely Different

The point is not that the mainstream Democratic stance on birth control is a sin of partisanship, but that in the new regime, two separate logics and cultures rule two separate, but co-dependent, realms of life. This state of affairs transcends “partisan ideologies” as we know them. The shared neoconservative and neoliberal affinity for enforced health and safety, and their shared fear and loathing of the realm of illness and unquantified risk, plainly shows that one need not identify as a Democrat, liberal, or Progressive in order to champion the new officialdom. The issue is not, as it was with the military-industrial complex, what the elites think policy should be; it is what the elites instinctively think politics is.

One need not identify as a Democrat, liberal, or Progressive in order to champion the new officialdom.

Sticking with this line of inquiry allows us to get beyond the many interesting but contending and partial definitions of the relevant elite in America—the “new class,” the “ruling class,” the “country club,” the “crony capitalists,” the “1 percent,” the “east-coast power corridor,” and so on. These are all manifestations or avatars of the only elite that, analytically speaking, suffices as a unit of analysis, because only this analysis indicates what everyone is struggling to surmise, namely, the character of the new American regime.

The new regime is not totalitarian, fascist, socialist, capitalist, conservative, or liberal, according to the accepted and common definitions of those terms. It is not even adequately described as corporatist, although corporatism is very much at home within it. The “pink police state” is not a police state in the sense that George Orwell would be familiar with, but one in which a militarized, national policing apparatus is woven into the fabric of trillions of transactions online and off. Nor is it a “pinko commie” regime in the sense of enforcing “political correctness” out of total allegiance to Party; rather, it enforces the restrictions and permissions doled out by its sense of “clean living.” To invoke Michel Foucault again, ours is an age when governance is inseparable from hygiene in the minds of the elite that rules over both the private and public sector. To them, everything is theoretically a health issue.

This is why the attempt at a national health care program was an utterly predictable development—a veritable precondition of our new regime’s full development. Although we like to think national health is the consequence of our extreme distaste for the suffering of some and not others, it is more the product of the categories of thought that define our regime. Health and safety is what the state does.

The industrial, mechanical logic of the old regime approached the concept of governance instrumentally. It led us to define governance by answering the question, What is the state for? The therapeutic, existential logic of the pink police state rejects such a purpose-based approach. Health and safety is not what the state is for; the practice of health and safety is literally the practice of justice.

Why We Can’t Stop Obsessing Over Sex

The prerogative thus belongs to the state, on the contemporary view, to define what is and is not healthy, and what is and is not safe. So we should not be surprised that the state has been sucked so extensively into matters of sexuality. The most socially significant conflict over sexual identity is not a lurid Manichean struggle between “traditional” and “progressive” morality. Rather, it’s an incessant struggle of attrition between realms: the realm the regime controls, with its comprehensively administered ethic of health and safety, abuts—but can never conquer—the unregulated realm of dirty danger. Adjudicating the healthfulness and safety of our myriad sexual practices, affinities, choices, and identities is a task so monumental it can keep the largest bureaucratic government busy.

In the new regime, two separate logics and cultures rule two separate, but co-dependent, realms of life.

To that, however, the new regime must add the chore of therapeutically processing that psycho-sexual activity. To prevent itself from being overwhelmed by a proliferation of dirty, dangerous sexual phenomena, the regime must always domesticate and incorporate new choices, new practices, and new identities, sublimating once-transgressive lifestyles into cosmetic virtues understood to aid the health and safety of the regime—whether in the “public” or “private” sector.

Here, there is no better example than the sea change in the status of LGBTQ individuals and the whole concept of diverse sexual identities. Big government and big business elites have more or less rushed with open arms to wave the rainbow flag—increasingly, in a literal sense. Today it does not really count as news that a Bank of America branch in the heart of West Hollywood has decorated its lobby with lots of festive little rainbow flags. There was, however, a minor stir when the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv recently hoisted the rainbow flag just below the Stars and Stripes itself.

For some, the event was a sensational reminder of the difference between the progressive, post-Judeo-Christian world and the world of reactionary Islam. Be that as it may, the official admission of queer culture into the realm of health and safety illustrates the challenges the new regime poses to our old Constitutional order. Although the First Amendment is “biased” in favor of religion—extending special protections to religious speech and practices that irreligious conduct simply does not receive—the First Amendment is also quaintly blind to the state’s current interest in establishing a secular, not religious, creed.

The new regime is not totalitarian, fascist, socialist, capitalist, conservative, or liberal, according to the accepted and common definitions of those terms.

This is key to understanding the absolute importance of “diversity and inclusion.” These foundational ideas are not best seen as “ideological values.” They are sociological practices essential to the functioning of the new regime. And lest we imagine that the new regime is itself an ideological value in action—merely the product of a revolutionary cultural and political vanguard—it is essential for us to realize that the new regime is inherently unable to become totalitarian in the sense, say, that Leo Strauss envisioned in his legendary argument with Alexandre Kojeve.

At the midpoint of the last century, these two preeminent political theorists entered into an extended debate about the possibility of tyranny in our time. To make a long story short, Strauss worried that it would become impossible to practice philosophy in what Kojeve claimed was a just regime. That regime, said Strauss, would successfully persecute philosophers out of existence, just as ancient Athens sentenced Socrates to death. The Athenians, of course, charged Socrates with corrupting the city’s youth. Though Strauss does not come right out and say it, his defense of philosophy raises the arresting prospect of a deep connection between free thinking, wisdom, and—from the standpoint of an unjust regime—sickness and danger. Strauss, however, seemed really to believe that modern political science had made universal tyranny—the eradication of philosophy—conceivable for the first time.

The rise of the pink police state should disabuse us of that notion. The new social divide that defines our new regime will always propagate zones of transgression against health and safety as defined by officialdom. This is not just because the horizon of transgression always recedes from the reach of officialdom, however unprecedented in its scope—although it is certainly true that the Internet, and the patterns of thought and action it allows us to carry into “real life,” have created a topography of transgressive space so protean that the National Security Agency, for instance, must vacuum up all the data in the world just to hope that it can find some transgressions. That may be good news for terrorists. It is great news for philosophers.

Ours is an age when governance is inseparable from hygiene in the minds of the elite that rules over both the private and public sector.

The rise of the Internet, in fact, is emblematic of the strange conceptual character of the new regime. Although the state is implicated in the rise of the Internet, and although the state is dogged in perpetually intervening in the Internet, the Internet has a life of its own. It can never be fully integrated into the regime. The Internet is a symbol of how partial is the responsibility of the pink police state for its own dawning triumph. Our new regime is so deeply therapeutic because it is, viewed in psychoanalytic terms, a coping mechanism for the disintegration of the public-private divide. Although Rieff declared that “the rot starts at the top, always,” he acknowledged that in America there never was an “officer class” to abdicate its commanding culture caste. The innovation of our age is a new officialdom that does not owe its power to its position atop the hierarchy of cultural authority. That vertical of social order is gone; in its place, our movement within social space and time is horizontal.

That is typical of democratic ages, when things are always getting better and worse. We are always becoming more like Eloi and more like Morlocks. The “rot”—in Rieff’s terms, the choice to violate boundaries set down by cultural authorities, starts everywhere, in every soul or psyche. The collapse of the public-private divide is not the “fault” of America’s decadent elites, its debased underclass, or its neurotic middle class. It is the fault of everything and everyone in contemporary life. As Augustine said: Such as we are, such are the times.

Three Things to Expect From This Regime

Although government health care opponents fear our regulatory state will decree ever broader swaths of life “public,” the reality is that the whole language of “public” and “private” is passing away as the “pink police state” comes into being.

To return to the question we began with, what, then, replaces that primary social divide? The new divide, we recognize, has to do with a sick-dangerous realm on the one hand and a healthy-safe one on the other. We can now start to see that the safe-and-healthy realm is the official realm, which makes the sick-and-dangerous realm the unofficial realm.

Because interpersonal, hedonic freedom is so privileged, resistance may completely break down to government actions that get involved in the intimate details of our lives.

In the new regime, the regulatory state asserts control over those areas of “public” and “private” life that it chooses to control, while leaving other areas relatively (sometimes completely) out of control. Life in the official realm is characterized by the pursuit of health and security—the clean, safe, but coercively sterile world—while life in the unofficial realm is characterized by the pursuit of harms and risks—the dirty, dangerous, but ultimately and inexorably fertile world.

Establishing this framework allows us to trace a chain of three causal mechanisms that show us what to expect from the new regime in action.

First, in a culture where social or interpersonal freedom is valued much more than political freedom, government becomes assertive in restricting “unhealthy” and “risky” activity, but assertive in broadening the ability of individuals to pursue pleasure in “healthy” and “secure” ways. That means both more permissiveness and more intervention in sexual life: a bigger portion of society is “sexualized,” and a bigger portion of society falls within the official sphere of life. (For a long time, that has certainly not been the case. Now it is. Such are the hallmarks of a revolution, the ending of one regime and the beginning of another.)

Second, government’s active interest in partnering intimately with individuals to help them achieve safe, secure pleasure and satisfaction leads strangely to a culture of greater transgression outside the reach of the government, in the unofficial sphere it doesn’t control. This is ironic. Katherine Frank wants to show that the Iranian regime’s oppressive moralism pushes Iranian youth to explore orgies as forms of rebellion not just in mores but in politics too. But in a pattern repeated literally around the clock on college campuses, the American regime’s sex-positive official moralism seems to inspire individuals to also seek unregulated, unofficial, and officially disapproved-of hedonic experiences—in addition to, or even instead of, what’s officially endorsed.

What’s more, sex-positive government moralism can and sometimes does look down on those who would have “too much” reproductive sex—whether “irresponsibly” or not. The realm of officialdom is a realm, as William Voegeli has written in Never Enough, of a limitless appetite for resources. But officialdom is perpetually anxiety-ridden about the possibility of exhausting its resources—whether it is figuratively sterile or figuratively barren. That is because its controlling opposition to the unclean, unhealthy, and unsafe always arouses a fear of contamination. (Psychologically, the insinuation of that fear into the otherwise-expert confidence of officialdom quietly demonstrates how vulnerable the official realm really is to being contaminated!)

Indeed, in the official realm, the possibilities of productive effort are sharply narrowed by rejecting the fecundity of the unclean, unsafe realm. In the unofficial sphere, by dramatic contrast, those concerns and fears are absent. Instead, the habit is to squander its characteristic creative and generative resources.[1]

Paradoxically, and problematically, the official and unofficial realms that construct our new regime are co-dependent yet limitless in their appetites.

Returning to our three causal mechanisms: Lastly, and most troublingly, the political and cultural relationship defining the pink police state seems to not be a stable system. There is no logical limit to how intrusive the new regime will get. Because political freedom is disvalued, once-“public-” and once-“private-”sector surveillance and monitoring may become completely comprehensive and permanent. This result is encouraged by a culture which feels increasingly fated to do what it is apt to do anyway by choice: put interpersonal, hedonic freedom far above political freedom in our relations with the state. Because interpersonal, hedonic freedom is so privileged, resistance may completely break down to government actions that get involved in the intimate details of our lives in ways that agents of the state believe properly promote and advance that freedom.

At the same time, because official forms of pleasurable freedom never seem to be enough (that is, never capable of actually satisfying the human appetites toward which they are aimed) there is no logical limit to the degree of boundary-crossing, risk-indulging, and pleasure-seeking transgression within the unofficial sphere of life—which, in the “pink police state,” is a built-in, ineradicable, and necessary sphere.

Paradoxically, and problematically, the official and unofficial realms that construct our new regime are co-dependent yet limitless in their appetites. That relationship raises the arresting prospect that our souls or psyches do indeed mirror the structure and pattern of the pink police state. To fully articulate an anthropological view of the new regime, however, we stand to benefit from an exploration of its recent origins.

"In The Pink Police State, We Are All Bridget Jones Now","Read part two of this series here, and part one here.

Is the pink police state inevitable? To answer that question, we might begin with a smaller one. Why has this new regime arisen? More specifically, why hasn’t the development of the political and economic compact within what Marxists call “late capitalism” stuck to one of the several well-thought-out scripts written by many not-so-Marxist analysts and theorists?

A Marxist would likely reply that the answer is simple: because Karl Marx was right! To be sure, Marxists have outdone their capitalist contemporaries in imaginative structural analysis. But as with the few non-Marxists who do practice systems theory, the faulty conceptual cornerstone of the Marxist creed is that the collapse of our regime is really going to happen this time.

As Nouriel Roubini put it four years ago, “Karl Marx had it right. At some point capitalism can self-destroy itself because you cannot keep on shifting income from labour to capital without not having excess capacity and a lack of aggregate demand, and that’s what’s happening.”

Likely To Happen Versus Must Happen

Our most prominent systems theorists often tirelessly insist that regime collapse is not just inevitable but imminent.

It is important to see how these are two different arguments. Marx did not argue that our regime “can” destroy itself, but that it must. These ideas are readily conflated today because the rise of an apparent Age of Terror has infused fear into our oscillations between the official and unofficial spheres of life.

Marx did not argue that our regime ‘can’ destroy itself, but that it must.

In a democratic age, Alexis de Tocqueville explained, the dominant variety of individual and social motion is “restlessness,” which we should not hesitate to translate, in the parlance of our times, as craziness. “Among democratic nations,” he wrote, “men easily attain a certain equality of condition, but they can never attain as much as they desire. It perpetually retires from before them, yet without hiding itself from their sight, and in retiring draws them on. At every moment they think they are about to grasp it; it escapes at every moment from their hold. They are near enough to see its charms, but too far off to enjoy them; and before they have fully tasted the delights, they die.”

This struggle drives us crazy—into that half-mad world where we are neither officially insane nor unofficially sane. In America, Tocqueville continues, “suicide is rare, but insanity is said to be more common there than anywhere else. These are all different symptoms of the same disease […]. The will resists, but reason frequently gives way.”

We are all Bridget Joneses now, perpetually moving past the Edge of Reason. It is no surprise that this reference should come in so handy to us right this moment. After all, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was first published in 1999, and from 1998 to 1999, the pink police state was born.

Our Bipolar Selves and Government

Before we wind back the clock to the dawn of the pink police state, however, consider for a bit longer the matter of motion and collapse. We are now stuck living in a bipolar regime, where an officially healthy and safe realm coexists in a codependent coupling with an unofficial realm where fertility, filth, contamination, and danger all commingle.[1] The consequence of living in these two adjacent realms of insatiable but merely overlapping appetites is the acceleration of all things as we shuttle between them. The more kinetically we move, the more our fears acquire potential. The faster we are, the faster it becomes.

As President Obama put it, harshly, anxiously, in a State of the Union address: “America doesn’t stand still!”

The consequence of living in these two adjacent realms of insatiable but merely overlapping appetites is the acceleration of all things as we shuttle between them.

As the urban theorist Paul Virilio has argued, speed, progress, and fear blur together. According to Virilio, who came of age in occupied France, our “cult of speed,” our “propaganda of progress,” and our “administration of fear” all began with the Bomb. A political singularity, he claims, was opened up by the Manhattan Project—for the first time, it became thinkable to literally destroy the world in an instant.

For Virilio there is also an informational singularity afoot. “It creates a ‘community of emotions,’” he argues, “a communism of affects coming after the communism of the ‘community of interests’ shared by different social classes.” Here, Virilio warns, the “synchronization of emotion” actually “surpasses the power of standardization of opinion that was typical of the mass media in the second half of the 20th century.” Once we had “a democracy of opinion;” now, we’re stuck with “a democracy of emotion.”

Virilio fits the model of unofficial dissidence in the pink police state. He says his task “is to focus on the fear that is hidden by the ideology of progress” in what we are calling the official realm. But even though he uses his own unique concepts, he helps us restore the blurred line between the inevitable and the imminent. Without the right kind of political economy, he claims, “we will fall into globalitarianism, the ‘totalitarianism of totalitarianism.’” That seems to bring us back to Leo Strauss’s fear that philosophy will become impossible in the realm of officialdom. It seems to fit right into the pattern of systems theorists, conflating what must happen with what could happen.

When Time Completes Itself

But there is a catch. Virilio is a Christian, for whom propagandizing and proselytizing are inherently different kinds of activity. To understand how they differ, consider how time is thought of differently when thinking of what must happen versus what could—even at any moment—happen.

The unrest seemed to confirm that the progress of Western democracy toward the post-communist political economy was threatened by a new, domestic adversary.

The secular idea of an inevitable collapse is conceptually distinct from the religious idea of the end-times. In the realm of faith, there is no way to predict the speed of events that are significant to the soul—including the “final” event, the spiritual singularity. In realms of fate, fact, or fiction, the ability to sense the speed of events becomes of paramount secular importance. How long until the missile hits? How long can you stay erect? As Thomas Pynchon made clear in Gravity’s Rainbow, these questions are two of a kind for some very deep reasons. In a secular age, plumbing their depths readily becomes an obsession, both in official and unofficial life.

For faith-based dissidents in the unofficial realm, the whole secular concept of time must be rejected. Take, for instance, Jesus’s saying in Mark 1:15. “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.” In propagandists’ terms, this means that an important event is imminent. In proselytizers’ terms, however, it means that an important condition has always already been the case.

This distinction is crucial. We are tempted to collapse it because we humans are biologically disposed to think of our lives as lists of “life events.” Consider the experience of converting to a religion. From an egotistical, biological standpoint, the conversion is an event, something that happens to the self. From a cosmic or super-natural standpoint, however, the character of the event is less important than the context that defines it. In Christianity, for instance, it is always the case that Christ’s sacrifice had already made God’s grace accessible to us.

In the triumphant years at the close of the 20th century, the opponents of the Western powers did not, and could not, amount to actual rivals.

You don’t have to be religious to understand how naturally reluctant we humans are to accept the “always already” at the expense of our sense of “eventhood.” The idea was important for Marx himself, whose vision of all individuals as always already social helped launch the whole postmodernist inquiry into the construction of reality through language.

Nevertheless, Marxists who take religion more seriously stand a better chance of realizing just how different claims of imminence and inevitability really are. It is one thing to say the collapse of capitalism is around the historical corner. It is another to say the end of history will arrive only in the fullness of time.

Marxists and Secularists Are Confused

Marxism has typically been torn between these two statements, and has typically erred on the side of trying to hasten the collapse of capitalism. Alas, History keeps disappointing the Marxists, and the Marxists keep blaming Capital, with its ever-more-quickly evolving wiles.

In a secular age, the supposedly inevitable tends quickly to become the imminent. That confusion has tended to influence Marxist as much as non-Marxist systems theory.

Ironically, Marxists would love to claim responsibility for the events at the dawn of the pink police state. Unfortunately for them, however, the pink police state can be understood historically as the regime that arose to effectively postpone political revolution indefinitely—although not permanently.

To find that moment in historical time, we must go back to the fateful years of 1998 and 1999, the brief era when the pink police first made their appearance on MTV.

The Battle of Seattle

Consider again the late ‘90s world of Marilyn Manson’s “Mechanical Animals.” Just about a year after its release in September 1998, anti-globalization protestors clashed with riot police in what was then considered a definitive expression of society’s new grand divide. At the opening Ministerial Conference of what was meant to be the “Millennial Round” of World Trade Organization negotiations, our progress toward what Francis Fukuyama called “the end of history” was forcibly interrupted by the so-called Battle of Seattle.

This interruption did not just occur in real life. Even more importantly, it arrested the elites who had conceived of the dominant idea of progress and were busily working to execute it.

The radical truth was we were all losers.

A media sensation, the unrest seemed to confirm that the progress of Western democracy toward the post-communist political economy was threatened by a new, domestic adversary—one quite unlike the external foe whose defeat had brought a sudden end to the Cold War.

To be sure, some enemies remained abroad. In a handful of “rogue” or “failed” states, Western strategists faced a growing assortment of what Hans Magnus Enzensberger would later term “radical losers”—terrorists, guerillas, and criminals acting beyond the reach or the view of sovereign powers. In certain troubling instances, these problem actors worked together, or even converged.

But from North Korea to Afghanistan, these perils appeared mainly to be remainders and aftereffects of the Cold War. No new vision had seized power in a way that challenged the primacy of the West. No one really worried, as Western elites worried about Stalinism during the 1930s, that the narcoterrorists and strongmen of the 1990s offered a serious alternative to capitalist liberal democracy—much less one which the logic of history seemed to anoint over a declining and divided West.

The ‘Fight Club’ phenomenon, that is to say, captured a social situation that, in 1999, felt broadly real—to elites, would-be revolutionaries, and the rising generations caught in the middle.

Now, history had declared for democracy. In the triumphant years at the close of the 20th century, the opponents of the Western powers did not, and could not, amount to actual rivals. They were “throwbacks,” “dead-enders”—primitives. Rather than a source of anxiety, these figures were problems to be solved by elite Western experts, or, at worst, managed until a solution became feasible. A sense of panic did not surround these bureaucratic processes because our atavistic opponents had literally been left behind by the speed of events.

The one possible exception to this geopolitical rule was China. But here, any geopolitical anxiety was carefully ironed out, in a grand bargain that entailed “constructive engagement” on the part of the West and a “peaceful rise” on the part of China. In finance and economics, globalization would bring East and West closer than ever before; politically, nothing much within either “hemisphere” would change. The Chinese would bend the market to autocracy. The Western powers would use the market to spread democracy quickly and cheaply enough to justify a policy of nonconfrontation. After all, the durability of Chinese autocracy itself reassuringly augured a parallel democratic quietude in unipolar America and the new, larger Europe. There was something reassuring in the idea that any regime type could supply a surface for progress to hover swiftly above—and something tremendously rousing in the notion that progress could now rove unimpeded across any political surface.

Still Alienated by Capitalism

Or so it seemed, until the Battle in Seattle—which struck at the very core of the vision of post-Cold War American development. Long before neoconservative critics of neoliberal bliss ironically declared a “holiday from history,” radical theorists of the Left, like Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, began to insist that the liberal democracies could never incorporate all of humanity into a single political economy because of the West’s own contradictions. The mere failure of Marxists’ positive agenda, they claimed, didn’t drain Marx’s critique of the West of its force. According to the radicals, democratic capitalism produced stable, profitable regimes by plowing their externalities inward, toward the “imperial” core, and not just outward, into the (post)colonial periphery. No amount of goodwill toward the global South could successfully repress the consciousness of the capitalist masses at home that they toiled in alienation from nature, community, and self. The radical truth was we were all losers.

Bourgeois hedonism, the radical anti-capitalists avowed, was not just too small a prize for our bloodless corporate labors. It was too sterile, too fruitless—as Heather Havrilesky is now making explicit in her anti-capitalist critique of “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Our pornographic magazines once “effectively equated the moment of erotic indulgence with the ultimate consumer release, a totem of the final elevation into amoral privilege;” now, she writes, “James’s trilogy represents the latest installment in the commodified sex genre. The money shot is just that: the moment when our heroine realizes she’s been ushered into the hallowed realm of the 1 percent, once and for all.”

Then as now, the capitalist masses may not have translated their malaise and neurosis into revolutionary action, but in 1999, the antiglobalist vanguard chose street combat over fantasy entertainment. Intriguingly, in 1999 the Internet had become mainstream, but Internet porn had not.

The ‘Fight Club’ Critique

It is now a cliché to quote the rousing speech from “Fight Club,” where the alienated losers are told to be “very, very pissed off” because “we’re slowly learning” that “we won’t” become “millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars.” In 1999, however, those words had a vitality that our old boxes of college DVDs do not.

The progressive ideology of crafting public policy through regulatory bureaucracy offered a way out of confronting the “hard choices” that always and already arise among neighbors meeting face to face to share in self-government.

Indeed, Tyler Durden, the alter ego of the socioeconomically oppressed white corporate drone played by Edward Norton, took his animating vision out of the basement fight clubs and, at the story’s climax, onto the streets—literally blowing up the high-rises that housed the big banks, and blowing up with them Americans’ debt. “Out of these windows,” he says, “we will view the collapse of financial history. One step closer to economic equilibrium.”

On one interpretation, “Fight Club” is not much more than a well-timed allegory about gay identity and moral nihilism. It is telling, however, that the movie adaptation turned the rather misogynist book into something more like a love story. In the film, revolutionary political action is the means by which Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter escape the realm of officialdom, with its cubicles and its therapy groups where the terminally ill came to cope. The “Fight Club” phenomenon, that is to say, captured a social situation that, in 1999, felt broadly real—to elites, would-be revolutionaries, and the rising generations caught in the middle.

That situation was defined by the shocking irruption of a forward-looking revolutionary attitude. That shock, and not the atavistic attacks of 9/11, truly captured the “existential threat” to the trajectory of Western regimes in history. Durden summed up the problem in another speech memorized by many a proto-millennial male:

I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War, no Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war. Our Great Depression is our lives.

Durden gave voice to the anti-globalist dream—ultimately, humanity’s shared dream—of profoundly social yet personal lives of real, and not virtual, worth. It is a dream, as today’s hipsters reveal, that is not foremost about money. On the one hand, today’s hipsters are often downwardly mobile by choice; on the other, they are known to tote around top-of-the-line laptops—sometimes bearing a sticker that could have been slapped on the side of Little Boy: “This Machine Kills Fascists.”

Chaining The Beast Within

Instead, the dream is about fruitful, regenerative human life—in all its messy, contingent, and unregimented glory and possibility. But in the pink police state, where the unofficial realm is often too beastly and fugitive to ground such a life, that dream becomes a fantasy that is hard to envision and even harder to articulate.

In the spirit of ’99, however, valorized by the likes of Hardt and Negri, the youthful dreamers were not just scrappy romantics. They were, of necessity, anti-capitalists. They were throwing the protean and adaptive strategies of parasitic survival back in the face of the unfeeling machine that had perfected those strategies. Leading a new, popular counter-West, the street-fighting dreamers would take back humanity—because they would take down the machine they raged against. (Yes, “The Battle of Los Angeles” was recorded in 1998 and released in 1999.)

Technocracy marches hand in hand with emotivism: our therapeutic culture of feelings, sensitivity, compassion, sincerity, and self-esteem.

As is often the case with popular movements, some adherents are there because of what they are for, others because of what they are against. From the standpoint of American elites, however, there was no time to sort out proto-hipsters from fight clubbers from anti-capitalists. For American elites, the spirit of ’99 was grounds for a level of geopolitical anxiety on par with the Cold War—one that “fundamentalist Islam” and “radical jihad” inherently could not, and so would not, attain.

Taking the fear past the edge of reason, Bret Easton Ellis followed up “American Psycho” with the ultimate geopolitical taboo. In “Glamorama,” published just days before New Year’s Eve 1999, a male model in his late twenties—who just happens to be the son of a powerful senator—slides “down the surface of things” into a nightmare world where the most beautiful and wealthy libertines on earth are also the planet’s most soulless and lethal terrorists.

Ellis revealed what the anti-capitalist view of “Fifty Shades of Grey” conceals: it’s not all about money. It’s about what Nietzsche called “the beast”—the monster that lurks within the human, always longing to get out.[2]

It’s Too Messy and Hard to Govern Ourselves

Adding to our elites’ new anxiety was how it seemed to fulfill, in a surprise way, the warnings and premonitions of a seemingly bygone era. According to the anti-globalization radicals, the neoliberal project to create world peace by institutionalizing economic interdependence was a failure. That critique strongly echoed the typical cautionary tales of 19th-century political theorists, who were gravely concerned about the internal logic of democratic times. Note that the mechanism of decay they identified was not shaped by a belief that economics is the master science. Rather than seeing capitalism as the foundational problem, they saw the monetization of all things as simply one manifestation of the rising democratic age. And rather than seeing democratization as a primarily political process, marked by the steady expansion of rights and regulations, they saw it as an anthropological one, marked by the increased equalization or interchangeability of all persons. Whether liberal or anti-liberal, whether friendly or unfriendly critics of democracy, theorists like Nietzsche and Tocqueville warned of a dystopia wherein whole peoples abandoned their drive, dynamism, freedom, and pride, in favor of an “oriental” despotism that ensured their health, safety, efficiency—and servility.

Subsequently, 20th-century conservative critics of the rise of progressivism in turn-of-the-century liberal democracy traced back to canonical figures like Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, and Mill a powerful philosophical technophilia—one that promised relief from the pressures and dilemmas of democratic life by infusing the very notion of politics with scientific values and objectives. For elites and common folk alike, the progressive ideology of crafting public policy through regulatory bureaucracy offered a way out of confronting the “hard choices” that always and already arise among neighbors meeting face to face to share in self-government. In the terms of the pink police state, the work of republican democracy is awkward, clumsy, messy, risky, perhaps even dangerous. The expert application of science to governance, by contrast, is routine, scripted, predictable, and safe. The pathologies of political freedom are cleansed; democracy is made safe for the world.

But a More Comfortable Technocratic Rule Subjugates Citizens

According to 20th-century critics of progressivism, Right and Left, the alleged capture of our political and economic institutions by scientism was a landmark event. The rule of experts, they said, had not saved us. Instead, it produced a massive and unaccountable administrative apparatus, turning citizens into subjects and replacing real life with a simulacrum. Radical leftists began attacking neoliberalism on this basis; reactionary conservatives, neoconservatism.

Monetizing these fears was “The Matrix”—joining “Fight Club” at the box office in 1999. In that film, Joe Pantoliano’s traitorous Cypher tells Keanu Reeves’ Neo that he’s content to eat tender pink steak even though it “doesn’t exist,” with only the Matrix “telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.”

Democratic life is making us more gentle and more beastly at the same time.

Technocracy, the critics concluded, perversely uses our fear of death to inspire us to surrender our love of life. Under the vast soft despotism marking history’s end, we and our posterity will mark out insignificant, ignoble, perhaps even undignified lives. The fears of Tocqueville and Nietzsche will be realized; fat, numb, and happy, the technocratic rule of the expert few will reign over the dull functionaries below.

But as some of America’s harshest conservative critics have admitted, this is not exactly what has happened. Drawing from Philip Rieff, Alasdair MacIntyre and Christopher Lasch confirmed that technocracy marches hand in hand with emotivism: our therapeutic culture of feelings, sensitivity, compassion, sincerity, and self-esteem. Recalling to mind today’s Human Resources departments—possessed of an omnipresence Foucault would envy—MacIntyre and Lasch suggest that our big-brained technocrats have learned how to hardwire our big-hearted emotivists deep into the administrative apparatus. Government isn’t exactly like Nurse Ratched after all. Instead of seeing itself as a coldly militant enforcer, it loves to play the indispensible helper, as heroic and bold as it is warm and fuzzy.

Technocracy Can’t Tame the Human Soul

Rieff dreaded a therapeutic democracy in which all become one another’s “crippled pets.” Perhaps. But the real power of Rieff’s sociology of the therapeutic, too absent on the MacIntyrean right and the Laschean left, is in its recognition that emotion is fundamentally erotic, and eros is fundamentally resistant to domestication. In our erotic human nature there is always to be found the beast.

In the name of health and security, we are willing to compromise across a range of erotic fronts—but only so long as the transgressive possibilities of erotic life are kept open along other fronts.

From this view, which Nietzsche sometimes shares, any human content to eat tender pink steak that does not really exist must not, in any sense truly real for us, exist. In the name of health and security, we are willing to compromise across a range of erotic fronts—but only so long as the transgressive possibilities of erotic life are kept open along other fronts. The human longing for the reality of eros and its transgressions cannot be fully sublimated, repressed, or domesticated—not even by the most expert and comprehensive technocratic techniques. One way or another, the beast will out.

If this is true, many of our current concerns about technocratic democracy need to be radically revised. The classical liberal and contemporary conservative fear that the state will accomplish the final domestication of eros is as misinformed as the radical hope that the West’s internal divisions doom it to contradiction and destruction. The reality that commands our attention is that democratic life is making us more gentle and more beastly at the same time—more like servants and more like masters in a sense far more robust than even Rieff implied. Neither soft despotism nor system collapse is our fate. There is no fate.

Neither soft despotism nor system collapse is our fate. There is no fate.

From this standpoint, the why of the pink police state finds an answer. Historically, its rise can be seen as a so-far successful attempt to use the kinetic energy of spreading, deepening equality to therapeutically resolve the geopolitical anxiety of the elite on the one hand and the deep disenchantment of the people on the other. It is the rise of a somewhat forcibly negotiated settlement between the imperatives of the contending forces whose war was announced at the Battle of Seattle—the elite technocratic order and its popular erotocratic opposition.

But is it inevitable? Is there a way out of the Matrix? As Neo came to understand, to truly answer that question, we must now look within our own souls—mirror that they are for the regime in which we live.

[1] That which is now knowable only in unofficial life was once, remarkably, thrust into the faces of millions as a consequence of the mass personal experience with war. In Fear, Gabriel Chevallier’s lost classic of World War I, French troops on trench detail stumble upon an arresting truth. “The pick had hit a damp, rotten stomach, which released its miasma right into our faces, a sudden burst of foul vapor. […] The decomposing body’s disgusting gasses spread out, filled the darkness and our lungs, reigned over the silence. The NCOs had to force us back to this angry corpse, and then we shoveled furiously, desperate to cover it up and calm it down. But our bodies had caught the awful fecund smell of putrefaction, which is life and death, and for a long time that smell irritated our mucous membranes, stimulated the secretions of our glands, aroused in us some secret organic attraction of matter for matter, even when it is corrupt and almost extinguished” [emphasis added].

What Comes After The Pink Police State,"If we can escape from the pink police state, we can only do so by understanding its origins—and we can only understand its origins by grasping its relationship to our own souls or psyches. Rather than finding the answer in economics, public policy, democratic politics, or even religion, we are called to mere anthropology.

There are few guides for that kind of turn, away from conceptual schema and historical analysis. Fortunately, the best of them are already well-known to us: Plato and Alexis de Tocqueville. These two political theorists are, not coincidentally, master anthropologists.

They are separated by a vast historical gulf. But they are valuable to us for just that reason. Plato offers us a pre-modern, pre-Christian anthropology. Tocqueville offers us a modern, Christian one. At a time when many observers would say that life is increasingly post-modern and post-Christian, Plato and Tocqueville make strikingly different but strangely complementary wagers about how to escape our bad regime. What’s more, they help us contextualize and appraise the foremost post-modern, post-Christian wager about how to escape.

Consider Plato’s Cave

Socrates wagered that the only escape from a bad regime was a good soul. Although Socrates, and Plato after him, lacked a robust theology of sin and redemption, they saw philosophy as a sort of creed, capable of rescuing human beings from the error they reflected outward into the world and which manifested bad regimes.

In the firelight, we watched mere shadows on the walls, mistaking them for the real-life situations that cast them.

The good soul was not, however, saved by faith or deeds. It was a soul who loved the practice that readied it for rescue. Even still, rather than an affirmative moral code, Plato’s Socrates offered a fable. In it, we humans lived fettered in a cave. In the firelight, we watched mere shadows on the walls, mistaking them for the real-life situations that cast them. Rather than vegetating in ignorance, however, we became quite active in our chains. We created competitions: those who remembered the patterns of shadows that had been, and accurately guessed the patterns of shadows to come, won our esteem, along with fabulous prizes. These competitions were so engrossing that they practically constituted what we experienced to be real life.

One day, however, someone happened to be struck by a shaft of light from the outside world—light emanating from a place which those inside the cave lacked the conceptual apparatus to understand, or even to imagine. This ahistorical experience, and it alone, supplied humans with conceptual access to reality-based thinking. Indeed, instead of revealing to us a neutral, objective fact about “the world,” it disclosed to us what being human actually entails.

The good news about being human, according to Plato’s Socrates, is that we can choose to orient ourselves in a way that can recognize and receive the irruption of awareness if and when it comes to us. The bad news, however, is that unless and until it does, we labor fruitlessly at being human in the metaphorical cave. There, it endlessly, mistakenly occurs to us that we can learn everything ranging from “accurate facts” to “good values” to “human nature” and “reality” itself—if only we become expert at remembering what we imitate from those around us who are best at doing the same.

The awareness we can receive, if our souls or psyches are well-oriented toward readiness, discloses the opposite of what we reasonably but foolishly conclude in the cave. Inside the cave, we think that to be human is to be rational; in the awareness that arises from outside the cave, we apprehend that to be human is to be creatures who remember and who imitate.

Four Types of Regimes and Souls

Inside the cave, we face a choice among three different types of regimes and souls. First, we could choose a regime wherein the master idea is honor. Honor guides what and how to remember; honor guides who and how to imitate. Second, we could opt for a regime ruled conceptually by wealth. Rather than organizing our memory and mimicry around the best of human quality, we can organize them around the most of human quantity. Third, we could select a regime in which neither honor nor wealth are prized above all, but in which we remember and re-enact pretty much all things, so long as it seems they can be prized without necessarily excluding any others.

But there is a fourth type of regime, which few seem apt to choose, but which appears nonetheless. It corresponds to the master idea of power. Here, no particular thing is withheld from anyone; but access to everything is preserved for a single master alone.

Humans are so good at imitating and remembering that it makes us awful at resting on the one hand and creating on the other.

In Socratic terms, these regimes are labeled timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny, in descending order. And the master ideas that animate them are associated with the things that arouse love from their corresponding soul type. As many students and teachers of Socrates are well aware, this fable of regimes comes with a theory of history, too: each regime type degenerates into the next.

What’s less often discussed, as Joshua Mitchell has pointed out in “Plato’s Fable,” is the anthropological account that Plato’s Socrates offers as to why the regimes inexorably decay.[*] Rather than some esoteric mystery, the account is so simple and straightforward that almost everyone today can readily see it at work in their own lives.

The plain truth is that we humans are so good at imitating and remembering that it makes us awful at resting on the one hand and creating on the other. Our innate drive to imitate in accordance with our memories makes it almost impossible for us to repose in earthly peace. At the same time, it also makes us fall again and again into mistaking flawed imitations for unique creations. We think we are making autonomous choices; we are actually re-enacting involuntary patterns.

Our innate drive to imitate in accordance with our memories makes it almost impossible for us to repose in earthly peace.

Indeed, as Friedrich Nietzsche would later suggest, we are so good at imitating and remembering because it was essential to our survival. “Man could never do without blood, torture, and sacrifices when he felt the need to create a memory for himself,” Nietzsche wrote; “the severity of the penal code provides an especially significant measure of the degree of effort needed to overcome forgetfulness and to impose a few primitive demands of social existence as present realities upon these slaves of momentary affect and desire.”[†] Not only did we need imitation and memory to survive the natural world, we needed expertise in their practice to survive ourselves and one another.

Reach for the Stars

Unlike Plato’s fable, the fable of modern liberalism—the small-l liberalism shared until very recently by the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats alike—sees the history of memory and imitation in a very optimistic light. Rather than an inexorable decline toward tyranny, our souls and our regimes have progressed toward a point at which we are finally free to autonomously create without being cruel to anyone or anything. As Andrew W.K. recently put it: “In the old days, we had to use almost all our power just to survive—to find water, shelter, food. Little by little, we learned to master our environment, and later, to master ourselves. And now we can dedicate as much of our energy and precious time mastering and pursuing our highest ambitions and dreams.”

Here is the ideal of democracy just as Plato’s Socrates presented it—the regime ruled just as much by the love of all compatible pleasures as the souls within it.

America’s residual innocence about power has arrested democracy’s decay into tyranny.

Andrew W.K., however, has a Nietzschean (and Emersonian) edge to his democratic vision. He warns that a very modern and rational voice in your head may instruct you “that all of this is unrealistic or magical thinking. Well, that is exactly what it is. We WANT magic. We want to take reality and make it unreal until it is reformed in the way we envisioned. The naysayer in the back of your mind is simply fear—fear that things won’t work out and you’ll feel stupid for trying, fear that it will hurt and be too tiring to work this hard. But nothing can hurt more than giving up and living with the knowledge that you abandoned hope. For what? To be reasonable? To be responsible? To make someone else happy? Those are all tricks and pitfalls and ways to justify giving up. Deep down inside, you know that’s true.”

You know who else knew that was true?

But unlike Adolph Hitler, Andrew W.K. is an American, and one of the great blessings visited upon America is the naiveté about power found in its origins as a new country in a new world. To be sure, native Americans and African Americans have suffered grievously under that naiveté. But it has also spared America from the cataclysmic oscillations between reactionary re-enchantment and revolutionary disenchantment that ruined European civilization and plague it still. From the standpoint of Plato’s fable, America’s residual innocence about power has arrested democracy’s decay into tyranny.

Democracy in America

The United States of America would be an exceptional nation indeed if it was born free from, and immune to, the historical curse that has so stubbornly undermined peace and freedom in Europe and its former colonies—however “democratic” they make themselves out to be. America’s unparalleled fortune does not stop there, however. We American humans also benefit from an exhaustive, penetrating account of why we are exceptional in this way. Its name: “Democracy in America.”

Europe is cursed with a different sort of arrested development.

Tocqueville’s magnum opus is a book that requires years, if not decades, to wrestle with and absorb. Fortuitously, it is not that difficult to understand his anthropology—or its significance in accounting for America’s exceptional arrest of Plato’s fabled regime decay from Democracy to Tyranny.

Return for a moment to the idea that Europe is cursed with a different sort of arrested development. Today, the uneasy reign of the European Union—a de-centered combination of center-left democracy and center-right oligarchy—is imperiled once again by a longing for reactionary re-enchantment on the Right and revolutionary disenchantment on the Left. The Europe predicted by Benjamin Constant, wherein Napoleon figured as a last gasp of the obsolete “age of conquest,” and the “age of commerce” would spread gentle mores and reciprocal advantage among all, seems as distant as ever.

On this analysis, Europe is not just torn between “ideological” extremes of Right and Left. Those political poles have gathered strength because they map onto competing anthropologies, which European culture has failed to provide a way to reconcile. The trouble is that the anthropology Tocqueville articulated has been lost on contemporary Europeans, no less than their more honor- and money-loving ancestors. The European soul, if we may, seems not to grasp that the oscillation between reactionary re-enchantment and revolutionary disenchantment is the political manifestation of the oscillation within the soul that defines the human condition.

For Augustine, like Tocqueville, only a ‘return’ to a certain ‘Source’ may ‘absolve human life of its unrelenting oscillation.’

That oscillation, as Mitchell, again, has explained, is not just the concern of Tocqueville. “Whatever their differences, Augustine, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Tocqueville are unanimous in their concern with the instability of human life, with its tendency to get wholly and broodingly caught up in itself or pridefully and explosively to overstep its bounds.”[‡]

Tocqueville’s insight on this matter commands our closest attention, because it is Tocqueville, alone among the great political anthropologists, who focused his closest attention on us. But Mitchell shows that Tocqueville’s anthropology makes adequate sense to us when illuminated by that of St. Augustine. For Augustine, like Tocqueville, only a “return” to a certain “Source” may “absolve human life of its unrelenting oscillation”—between the soul’s pull inward, toward consuming self-obsession, and its pull outward, toward the unquenchable hunger to consume the world.

Love of Autonomy and of Power Feed Each Other

Augustine’s idea of the saving Source is different from Tocqueville’s. For Augustine, there is no rest but in God. For Tocqueville, the problem is to preserve fruitful, reciprocal action, which, he suggests, can only be maintained in a democratic age at voluntary sites of face-to-face association. But both Augustine and Tocqueville lead us to understand that Americans—because they are humans—oscillate in a manner no less inherently unstable than that of the Old World. We simply have a better opportunity to ameliorate those oscillations, slowing their pace and buffering their psychological impact as they shuttle us toward their competing, yet complementary, extremes.

For Tocqueville, the problem is to preserve fruitful, reciprocal action, which, he suggests, can only be maintained in a democratic age at voluntary sites of face-to-face association.

This amelioration can arrest what Plato’s Socrates would say is the inevitable slide from lively democracy into decadent tyranny. To be sure, Tocqueville does not share Plato’s pre-modern view of historical development. Where Plato charts a path of political decay, Tocqueville warns that the collapse of the “aristocratic age” unleashes great dynamism and optimism, only to gradually discourage the many as they encounter the invisible barriers to ambition and advancement that arise in the “democratic age,” when competition is ubiquitous for all but a tiny minority of the naturally ambitious and talented.

Once the optimism of the transitional age between the two falls away, “the love of merely human liberty” gradually loses its ability to mask the “secrets that predispose the soul toward anguish, if not tyranny.”[§] These secrets, Mitchell puts it, are twofold: “on the one hand, the hidden love of the powerful state that lurks in the hearts of the solidary souls who purport to love their freedom; on the other hand, the taint of envy that lurks in the hearts of the souls who love equality.”[**]

These secrets reveal that “the soul who advocates top-down government and the soul who purports to love liberty above all else” express attitudes that only seem opposed to one another; actually, they “are aspects of a single phenomenon, namely the inevitable impotence that attends independence.”[††]

Don’t be mistaken: Tocqueville shared the ardent love of political freedom, exercised through rights, that Americans have long held dear. He cautioned, however, that so many of us become isolated and interchangeable that potentially all of us end up paying prideful lip service to a false kind of autonomy. The point has recently, if inadvertently, been underscored on Twitter. There, one clever music video director quipped that “Beyoncé albums follow a simple formula.” The message of the odd tracks, he suggested, was “I don’t need a man;” the even tracks, “I miss you baby.”

In a democratic age, prideful declarations of independence mask an envious longing for some force powerful enough to equalize our power and status.

With jokes like that, some politicians of gender detect more than a whiff of sexism in the air. Tocqueville, by contrast, would suggest that, in a democratic age, we are all apt to repeat the pattern wherein prideful declarations of independence mask an envious longing for some force powerful enough to equalize our power and status relations. In Tocqueville’s view—and that of Hobbes—such a longing can only be gratified completely by a government capable of totally overawing everyone, thereby erasing our pride and our envy.

But there is no way of knowing how long the transitional age will endure before the democratic age fully sets in. Until it does, Tocqueville intimates, we will want experience both ways. For psychological and biological reasons, we will crave autonomy and servitude in equal measure. The implications of this train of thought are sobering. If Tocqueville is right, the onset of the democratic age lays bare a shocking truth. Freed from the artificial, hierarchical trappings of aristocratic honor culture, the psychological oscillations encoded into our human biology can forcefully show forth in politics—dividing life into an official sphere, ruled by the love of health and safety, and an unofficial sphere, ruled by the love of generative and destructive power that officialdom sanitizes and restricts.

An Unstable Regime, Like Us

Tocqueville did not manage to foresee the advent of the pink police state. But present-day Tocquevilleans like Peter Augustine Lawler have prepared the way in noting that “one basic insight of Tocqueville is that things are always getting better and worse.” This strange phenomenon shows up for us as an increasing servile docility in the official realm and an increasing autonomous beastliness in the unofficial realm.

‘One basic insight of Tocqueville is that things are always getting better and worse.’

Tocqueville understood that this bifurcation of life could indeed lead to tyranny in a democratic age. Even in an environment of complete servility, where there is no opportunity to channel ambition, pride, and talent into politics, our restless psychological transactions burst through. One “who has so completely sacrificed his own free will does not, more than any other person, love obedience; he cowers, it is true, before the pettiest officer, but he braves the law with the spirit of a conquered foe as soon as its superior force is withdrawn; he perpetually oscillates between servitude and license.”[‡‡] Likewise, life in the pink police state is defined by the perpetual oscillation of the many between servitude within officialdom and license within unofficialdom. What happens on the level of society happens on the level of the individual as well.

Rather than the regulatory state compelling people into behaving this way, it maps itself, so to speak, onto our anthropological propensity to do so. Rather than sealing off the horizon of human experience, as tyrannies do, the pink police state contents itself to seal off official life in the almost literal sense of a quarantine. The oscillation that defines our anthropology is preserved—making us “happier” at some times, and more “miserable” at others, but crucially attending to the two polar urges that have always made up the central psychological problem facing political order.

That is why the pink police state is neither inevitably triumphant nor inevitably doomed. Thanks to the endless interplay of its unquenchable, irreconcilable desires, it is only unpredictably unstable—just like us.

An End to Identity Politics and the Fixed Pie

At last, from this vantage point, we can consider the burning question with which we began. How can we escape? What alternatives remain to the pink police state?

Our animating fear is that our freedom to choose lives we love (or even like) has been taken away, by—our selves!

American policy is now so hamstrung by bitter ideological combat that the possibility of practicing politics in the old modern sense seems to be called into question. What can it now mean to seek our emancipation from the pink police state? On what basis can that quest be formulated successfully, as one in which ordinary Americans can share? To put it bluntly: how can political liberty, and not just some personal freedom, fruitfully capture the human imagination?

In times as shadowy as these, with the future always already unknowable, we will need more than cleverness to grope toward a workable answer. But one approach may be found in posing the following question. What sort of relationship with government would you consider choosing if, first, you set aside the fear in your life?

In a world where we are prisoners of our identity, all politics is identity politics, and all regulations are possibly proverbial matters of life and death.

For a Hobbesian, of course, this is an absurd proposition. Hobbes argues forcefully that only the Leviathan can overcome the fear-fueled politics of competition. But contemporary Americans of all classes are often consumed by deep anxieties that only seem to revolve around the relative gains of others. Deep down, we are somewhat aware, we actually fear that our lives are constrained in a far more absolute sense. Rather than the victim of more talented and ambitious competitors, we are caged by something akin to fate—by the ineradicability of our “baggage,” our “issues,” our “mistakes.” In short, our animating fear is that our freedom to choose lives we love (or even like) has been taken away, by—our selves!

It’s in this context that we need to view the acrimony and desperation of our political struggles. In a world where we are stuck with who we are, any politician who threatens to change the distribution of resources in a way that makes who we are “worse off” is direct attack on us personally. In a world where we are prisoners of our identity, all politics is identity politics, and all regulations are possibly proverbial matters of life and death.

To quote Andrew W.K. once again:

When we truly believe that some people are monsters, that they fundamentally are less human than we are, and that they deserve to have less than we do, we ourselves become the monsters. When we allow our emotions to be hypnotized by the excitement of petty bickering about seemingly important topics, we drift further and further away from the fragile and crucial human bond holding everything together. When we anticipate with ferocious glee the next chance we have to prove someone ‘wrong’ and ourselves ‘right,’ all the while disregarding the vast complexity of almost every subject—not to mention the universe as a whole—we are reducing the beauty and magic of life to a ‘side’ or a ‘type,’ or worst of all, an ‘answer.’ This is the power of politics at its most sinister.

As Andrew W.K. judiciously observes: “The best we can usually achieve is a crude and messy map of life from one particular vantage point, featuring a few grids, bullet points, and sketches of its various aspects and landmarks. Anything as infinitely complex as life, reality, and the human experience can never be summed up or organized in a definitive system[.]” Or, as Paul Virilo said: “I have no global answer or unifying vision of what must be done. I only have questions, clips, glimpses. Always fractals.”

Rather than pinning our hopes on policies, lawsuits, or any kind of political activity, we can only hope in the generative power of the unofficial realm of human experience.

Virilio is more concerned with how we live than with what we do. That shift of emphasis points toward a sane anthropology for a post-modern and post-Christian world—one that orients us firmly away from the pink police state. The escape from the pink police state is to be found in this messy, contingent domain. Only there can the anthropological reform begin that is so necessary to recuperating the very concept of liberty. Rather than pinning our hopes on policies, lawsuits, or any kind of political activity, we can only place true hope in the generative power of the unofficial realm of human experience, what Michel Foucault called “biopower.”

Here, life and death are met head on, not in the false guise of mortal enemies but in terms of a deeper reality that transcends such fear-fueled binary thinking. Only if we recognize that life must be affirmed along with death will we escape the peril of all too lifeless lives. Reflecting on the half-growing, half-rotting forests of primeval density that the pioneering Americans ventured deep within, Tocqueville mused: “death in some way helped life forward, as face to face they seemed to wish to mingle and confuse their functions” (27). This, beneath the litter of discarded prophylactics and the wreckage of cold intimacies, is the wisdom of the unofficial sphere, which the pink police state can never master, sterilize, or destroy.

Escaping the Pink Police State

Until the American imagination is captured by the project of ameliorating the anthropological condition that empowers the pink police state, partisans of liberty will struggle to promote their alternatives. If the life of fear preconditions our experience of our relationship with government, the pink police state will from the outset succeed in winning our hearts and minds over to the idea that freedom plays little-to-no role in the foundation of that relationship.

How, then, might we move and inspire Americans toward anthropological reform? What follows is one possible technique.

If the life of fear preconditions our relationship with government, the pink police state will from the outset succeed in winning our hearts and minds.

First, we must consider that we are not primarily rational creatures. This is a huge claim, but one with a long and authoritative pedigree. Thomas Jefferson avowed that “man is an imitative animal.” Said Tocqueville: “Feelings and ideas are renewed, the heart enlarged, and the understanding developed only by the reciprocal action of men upon one another.” Rational action presupposes language, memory, and a propensity to imitate. These faculties, which so often persist when reason has given way, are foundational.

Rather than preference-ranking machines, or ruthless competitors who survive because we’re fittest, our biological equipment actually holds us to a much lower standard. Our brains create patterns from experience and memory, then instruct us to interpret those “events” in accordance with its patterns. We conform the unknown to the known—and imitate our memories—in order to survive. It’s an effective process, but it causes us problems. We instinctively occur to ourselves as the upshot of our patterns of memories and imitations. When that assumption is suddenly called into question by reality, our sense of survival is threatened. We become gripped by fear.

Today, the dominant therapeutic strategy for coping with that fear makes a creed out of our obsession with health and safety. By creating a “safe zone” with “no wrong answers,” we can “come together” in a “happy place” where all dismaying distinctions collapse into a sedating universal whole. This sort of medicalized pantheism is becoming the religion of officialdom in the pink police state.

Some forms of therapy, of course, go another, unofficial route—into the doctrine once known as redemption by sin. These approaches create a risky, dirty space where “there are no rules,” only “safe words” that can call off our intimate theaters of acted-out transgressions. For many conservative culture critics, here is to be found are an even worse problem than what unfolds in the pious realm of officialdom.

A Third Way

The time has come, however, to go beyond such criticisms. A third kind of therapeutic approach has come into view. Instead of creating phony safe zones, it introduces relative strangers into reciprocal, face-to-face conversations—where the topic of conversation is why we pretend we can’t choose how to be. In this kind of setting, people can call themselves and one another to account for claiming that their patterns of imitation and memory rule their choices. While the two forms of therapeutic activity in the pink police state focus obsessively on discovering who we are, this different and better form of therapy recognizes that the first question we must answer is how we shall be.

People can call themselves and one another to account for claiming that their patterns of imitation and memory rule their choices.

The conduct of this inquiry opens us to three insights. First, when we drop the superstitious idea that we are fated to be what our patterns make us, we discover we’re already and always radically free to choose how to be. Second, taking action based on that discovery requires a kind of resourceful courage that’s applicable in any human situation. Third, equipped with that courage, we can deal with realizing that, when we clear away the patterns we mistake for ourselves, there really isn’t much “there” there. The “self” that society makes such a big deal about is pretty much just a frantic way of distracting us from our fear that we’re ultimately just as insignificant and interchangeable as everyone else.

This may sound Zen to you. It might sound Christian, in the sense expressed in the motto, “Not I, but Christ in me.” But it is really a more general anthropological insight than a particularly religious one. It helps us grasp an anthropology that abandons the obsessions of modernity without trying to exhume a Christendom that no longer exists. For the “spiritual,” it offers a much-needed rooting in plain reality. For the “religious,” it offers a way of describing grace to the uninitiated and skeptical.

Living a life based on choosing how to be has a supernatural feel. That’s because in living that way, we really are overcoming some of the most basic parts of our biological operating system.

This is a way of describing grace to the uninitiated and skeptical.

Here is the kicker: although we are free to creatively choose how to be, we are still always incomplete and partial in our imaginings. That our choices and creations have integrity does not mean that they can fill up or complete the world. Truly fruitful creativity requires not just the reciprocal action of others, but the mutual recognition that creative power is inherently contingent on “unknown unknowns.” Choosing how to be is an act of communion, knowingly dependent on a realm we can never master.

If we set down this path toward anthropological reform, we can wind up in a position to practice politics in a radically transformed and fruitful way. We’ll recognize that the pink police state is yet another flawed imitation of our psychological and biological patterns, beaten into our memory day in and day out until we mistake it with reality. Once we separate our fear from our restlessness, we can renegotiate our regime’s settlement between elite technocrats and popular erotocrats. As Tocqueville understood, the political challenge boils down to how well we can become a new kind of community organizers.

Why Ferguson Needs John Adams,"One of the many disappointments of the Obama era is the failure of the one promise which, more than any other, brought him into office backed by a surge of goodwill, with approval ratings around 80% on Inauguration Day. As the first black president, Barack Obama was going to heal the nation’s racial divisions and put an end to our divisive racial politics.

Now here we are five years later, and there’s a race riot in Missouri. No, this has nothing to do directly with Obama, but it has a lot to do with how he and the mainstream media have failed to actually do anything to elevate the way Americans deal with racially charged issues.

The issue is the shooting by a white police officer of an unarmed black man, 18-year-old Michael Brown. The officer claims that Brown tackled him and attempted to take his gun, making the shooting justified. A witness who says he was with Brown claims the shooting was unprovoked and that the officer killed Brown in cold blood. Memorial services and peaceful protests on Sunday devolved into an angry riot and the looting and burning of local stores.

We can assume—and interviews with local residents confirm—that these riots were driven partly by the longstanding resentment of local residents who complain of being singled out for harassment by the police. And we can also assume that most of the rioters were opportunists looking for an excuse to loot, rather than being honestly motivated by a desire for justice.

But what really concerns me is how everyone else—the mainstream media, the public, and the usual rabble-rousing politicians—are joining in on the riot and throwing out the rule of law.

Even pundits on the right are discussing with earnestness the question of whether we should back the police officer or show our willingness to be skeptical of the police account.

Here’s the thing: we should be skeptical of everyone. This story is still in its early stages, and the one thing we can say for sure is that much of what is being reported as breaking news or insider scoops or eyewitness accounts is going to turn out to be wrong. None of the physical evidence is available yet and eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. Eyewitness testimony not offered in court—under oath and with cross-examination—is even less reliable. And that goes for both sides.

This does not mean that we should make a presumption of innocence in favor of the police officer (though this will actually be required of the jurors who eventually hear the case). As spectators, we should start with a presumption in favor of nobody and wait until the evidence is compiled in a systematic, formal manner. The only way to do that will be in a courtroom.

Yet here we go making all of the same mistakes we made in the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case, where reporters did their usual bang-up job of writing the story first and then gathering the facts—only to see much of the early narrative about the shooting dissolve before the case even reached trial. Everyone was shocked when a supposedly open-and-shut case ended with an acquittal, even though it was clear that many of the details were ambiguous and left room for reasonable doubt. Which made that case little different from hundreds of others involving the use of deadly force.

Yet no one learned anything, and once again we can see all the same elements: the conceit that we can make a snap judgment right away about who was the good guy and who was the bad guy, that we can try the whole case in the media rather than a court of law, and that any court verdict which goes against the press verdict must necessarily be a miscarriage of justice. Above all, there is the presumption that this is all evidence of America’s deep, abiding, ingrained racism—so why shouldn’t blacks riot?

Recently, I discovered the concept of Gell-Mann Amnesia, which the late author Michael Crichton named after the physicist Murray Gell-Mann, with whom he once discussed the phenomenon. It’s what happens when you read a news item on a subject you know first-hand and notice all of the errors, over-simplifications, and outright howlers committed by the reporter. But when you turn the page (or today, click the next link), you forget how inaccurate that article was and read with full credulity what reporters have to say about some other subject on which you assume they must be experts.

We’re seeing a similar phenomenon here. Call it Zimmerman Amnesia. We ought to know from past experience how horribly inaccurate early reports about violent incidents can be. We ought to know how much can be distorted, misrepresented, and misunderstood by seemingly official or sympathetic sources on all sides, how long it can take for accurate information to come out, and how equivocal the results can be, with the evidence so evenly balanced as to convince partisans on both sides that they are right. But when every new politically charged shooting comes along, we forget what we should have learned, and there we all go, back to making confident pronouncements about who we think did what, who is the villain, and what is the remedy.

The cardinal sin here is the subordination of facts to a “narrative” adopted by activists and by the media. To adopt a narrative about how all police are racist or all police lie about shootings would be as unjust as to adopt a narrative about how all young black men are violent. Instead of insisting on our cherished narrative, we should be calling for the rule of law—which applies for everyone.

The relevant historical precedent for this is the Boston Massacre of 1770, in which British troops killed five men in what Americans said was an unprovoked shooting. The Redcoats were unpopular and resented, in much the same way, presumably, that the police are resented in Ferguson. And the shootings certainly played into the emerging American narrative of our oppression by a far-off, tyrannical monarch.

Yet local Patriots made a point of giving the soldiers a scrupulously fair trial, and no less a person than John Adams took on the task of the defending them. Adams was second to none in his support for the cause of liberty, and he would practically invent the idea of American independence. But he knew that liberty required the rule of law, which meant that the British troops deserved a genuine attempt to tell their side of the story and prove that their actions were justified. In the end, several were acquitted and two were found guilty of manslaughter.

Today, instead of John Adams, we get Al Sharpton—a man with, shall we say, a lesser reputation for integrity.

We could use some of Adams’s wisdom right now. We need a lot less jabbering speculation from the press, a lot less political exploitation of the case by rabble rousers, and plenty of calm but firm vigilance by local observers who can dedicate themselves to making sure that all of the evidence is gathered and weighed carefully.

Because everyone has a lot more to gain from the rule of law than they do from pushing their preconceived narrative.

"In Ferguson Protests, Media Somehow See Case Against Gun Rights","Anti-police protests continue in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of an unarmed teenager after an altercation there. Police have chosen to respond to public anger over this shooting (as well as opportunistic rioting and looting) not with deescalation of a tense situation but by pointing a lot of guns at citizens and using their monopoly on force to disperse protesters. They’ve used tear gas, rubber bullets, sound control and flash-bang grenades. They’ve hidden the identity of the policeman who killed the teenager. Media have been arrested and told to turn off their cameras. A local alderman was arrested for being out and about.

The situation in Ferguson is not great, Bob. And so I found one reaction among liberal journalists to be particularly curious. Let’s look at a few tweets:

Talk about gun rights is ridiculous. If the all the protesters in Ferguson had guns they'd all be dead — AdamSerwer (@AdamSerwer) August 14, 2014

@AdamSerwer Please do not tell me that people are actually holding this up as an argument for more guns — Max Fisher (@Max_Fisher) August 14, 2014

Huffington Post politics and immigration reporter Elise Foley also was disdainful toward gun rights, noting that Twitter users actually seemed to think gun rights a good thing, “sadly.”

To be honest, I don’t quite understand this point from BuzzFeed national editor (or is he still at MSNBC?) Serwer. Is he saying that gun rights are a bad thing because they give police officers more reasons to kill us? I mean, it’s one thing to say that this police force in Ferguson doesn’t seem like the kind of police force to respect individual rights and entirely another to say that therefore those rights are “ridiculous.”

I mean, let’s move back from the Second Amendment to the First Amendment and consider press rights. Let’s rework Serwer’s tweet a bit:

Talk about press rights is ridiculous. If more media were in Ferguson reporting this story, they'd be arrested, too.

The response to media being arrested in Ferguson isn’t to say that press rights are ridiculous, even if press rights clearly agitate the police. Or maybe Serwer and his friends actually do think that, I don’t know.

But more than that, it’s impossible to understand what being American means without understanding our belief in self-government. That belief in self-government is laid out in our founding documents. The Constitution, a document Vox’s Ezra Klein has found both confusing and old, begins with the words “We the People.” That’s us. And we the people became a people in the Declaration of Independence, where the authors announced the revolution and explained why we were revolting by writing:

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

So we have the right to revolt against despotic governments with a long train of abuses. The right to revolution assumes a means of revolution. And that means arms — the weapon kind, not the hugging kind. This is something that our media clearly don’t understand, much less agree with, but their beef is with self-government or logic more than the NRA.

Anyway, that’s what gun rights are about. Read the Second Amendment again with a mind toward recent events:

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

People have the right to keep and bear arms because it’s necessary for self-government, something other Twitter users picked up on when observing the media’s typical hate-fest for gun rights. Here were some of my favorite sarcastic tweets attempting to get the point across:

You're right, @Max_Fisher, #Ferguson is showing how important it is for police to have all the guns. @AdamSerwer — AmishDude (@TheAmishDude) August 14, 2014

@TheAmishDude @Max_Fisher @AdamSerwer Govt. should have all the guns to maintain proper public order – George III @sunnyright — Arthur Kimes (@ComradeArthur) August 14, 2014

There are people who see an oppressive state and out-of-control police and simultaneously think they should be the only ones armed. — SunnyRight (@sunnyright) August 14, 2014

The police, and state they represent, are thugs and tyrants. Tune in tomorrow when we explain why this means you should give up gun rights. — SunnyRight (@sunnyright) August 14, 2014

While being clear that no one has a sufficient understanding of the unstable situation in Ferguson or the events that led to it, if you can’t see the benefit of free people being armed as a curb against despotism — that is, the exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and oppressive way — you will likely never see it.

Which, as it turns out, is a good way to find yourself suffering under ever more despotic regimes.

Michael Brown And The Conservative Inconsistency,"Imagine that you’re a judge and two men, a shoemaker and a soldier, come before you to have a dispute settled. The shoemaker accuses the soldier of assaulting him. The solider maintains his innocence, providing clear evidence that he was on a battlefield hundreds of miles away at the time of the attack. When you ask the shoemaker to respond to this evidence, the shoemaker claims that the soldier employed his Professor X mind-control skills, seized the shoemaker’s consciousness, and forced him to ram his head into a bookshelf.

This is, of course, an easy and speedy case for you to judge. Immediately you know that the soldier is innocent. Had both sides offered equally plausible or equally implausible testimony, it would have been necessary to do some further digging to uncover the truth and rule fairly. But patience and prudence aren’t necessary when one side has furnished clear evidence and the other side is talking crazy.

The tragic shooting of Michael Brown, however, is nothing like the hypothetical case of the soldier versus the shoemaker. As it now stands with the limited evidence available to the public, both sides of the story sound equally ludicrous. It’s absurd that, as eyewitnesses in Ferguson, Mo. claim, a police officer would violently pull a young man into his car, fire off a shot, fire off another while the man tried to flee, then shoot the man to death while his hands were in the air, attempting to surrender. It’s equally absurd that, as the Saint Louis county police chief claims, a young man would try to force his way into a police officer’s car in order to steal his weapon, then somehow end up thirty-five feet away exhibiting some form of aggressive behavior towards a man he knew was pointing a gun at him. So why isn’t everyone saying, “Maybe I’ll refrain from making a judgment here until this starts to make more sense”? Why do so many refuse to employ patience and prudence when both sides seem to be talking equal parts crazy? In particular, why do conservatives seem to have such a hard time acknowledging that the police department’s account of that night’s events doesn’t make a tremendous amount of sense?

Why isn’t everyone saying, ‘Maybe I’ll refrain from making a judgment here until this starts to make more sense’?

By and large, conservatives favor limited government because they believe that power is prone to corrupt the individuals in government who wield that power. For the conservative, you don’t avoid tyranny by putting a king with no bloodlust on the throne. You avoid it by removing the throne’s ability to extract blood. This is why, for example, conservatives oppose gun control legislation—because they believe that a government that can forcibly disarm its citizens will eventually use that power to oppress its citizens.

But if you believe that individuals in power are maliciously trying to confiscate the weapons of law-abiding citizens, why is it completely outside the realm of possibility that an individual in power would maliciously use his weapon against a law-abiding citizen? When this principle of “power corrupts” is the driving force behind a conservative’s approach to the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, why are so many conservatives unwilling to apply it to those who enforce many of the government’s laws? In the days since Michael Brown’s death, we’ve seen video footage of police firing teargas onto people’s private property (language warning). We’ve heard reports of police arresting journalists who were not engaging in any illegal activity. If power seems to be corrupting those charged with keeping the peace during the recent unrest in Ferguson, why do some conservatives refuse to consider the mere possibility that a police officer may have been corrupted by power in the event that sparked the unrest?

why are so many conservatives unwilling to apply the ‘power corrupts’ principle to those who enforce many of the government’s laws?

The answer is, I think, quite simple. For many conservatives, especially those of us living in nice, comfy suburbs, it’s hard to apply the “power corrupts” doctrine to law enforcement because we’ve never seen corrupted enforcers of the law. We’ve never been wrongly arrested. We’ve never witnessed our children put in jail based on the false reports of police officers. We’ve never seen our neighbors beaten or tazed without cause. And in the extremely unlikely scenario that a police officer drove into our neighborhood and murdered our unarmed friend in cold blood, we cannot possibly fathom a scenario where the justice system wouldn’t be on our side and where that police officer wouldn’t spend the rest of his life in jail. Therefore Brown must have been a violent, gang-sign flashing thug, foolish enough to think he could swipe a cop’s weapon because, in our minds, there’s no conceivable way that a police officer would gun down an innocent man.

But just because we don’t see the corruption of law enforcement in our own lives doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. Police brutality is not the Bogeyman. It’s not an urban legend witnessed by none but told by many. It’s not a myth created by a primitive tribe that is too simple to understand the true source of the brokenness in its communities. Black people believe in police brutality for the same reason they believe in rain—because they’ve felt it.

Black people believe in police brutality for the same reason they believe in rain—because they’ve felt it.

Perhaps many in black communities have a skewed perception of how prevalent police brutality is. And perhaps many who contribute to criminal activity in these communities are guilty of shifting the blame they deserve to law enforcement, effectively fostering an unjustified culture of hostility towards the vast majority of police officers who are faithfully trying to keep those communities safe. But overstating your case is not the same thing as not having one, and unfairly dumping your share of guilt on your opponent doesn’t mean he’s perfectly innocent.

Conservatives are frequently, and unfairly, labeled as racists. Does it make you a racist to believe that a young black man named Michael Brown assaulted a police officer, tried to steal his weapon and then again displayed violent intent when that police officer was pointing the same gun at him? Not if you draw that conclusion based on the facts. But until enough evidence is available to reveal which implausible explanation for the events of August 9 is true, perhaps that label might fit those who insist on making judgments against Brown simply because they refuse to walk a mile in the shoes of those who have had drastically different experiences with the police. For those of us who have never experienced law enforcement corrupted by power, basic human decency should require that we try to understand and consider the perspective of those who have before we insist that their account of Brown’s death is somehow less believable than ours.

"Understanding Ferguson: Fort Apache, Missouri","Like most people who are getting into their 40s, I suffer occasional bouts of nostalgia. But lately, in a cruel irony, the world only seems interested in re-enacting the parts of my youth that I’d rather not relive. A Russian dictatorship that invades its neighbors. A stagnant economy with rising food and gas prices. A giant new welfare boondoggle. An overmatched president who seems too small for his office.

And now race riots.

The whole feel of it is captured by David “Iowahawk” Burge, who jokes about a man who wakes up from a coma after 45 years and asks the doctor about the latest news. The doctor replies: “Nixon is talking about the race riots.” The patient asks if he can be put back into the coma. That about sums it up.

I’ve described the whole Obama era as 20th Century Lite, “an era in which we will have to relive—hopefully in a shorter and shallower form—all of the disasters of the 20th century, as a cultural refresher course.” Because apparently we didn’t learn the lessons of the last century well enough the first time around.

I don’t think anyone can really understand the events in Ferguson without understanding this 20th Century Lite phenomenon, because the whole thing re-enacts in exact parallels all of the major elements of the mid-to-late-20th-century crime wave. It’s Fort Apache, The Bronx all over again.

That 1981 film, which has since lapsed into a probably deserved obscurity, captured the overall sense of how things had been going on the domestic front in the late 1970s, with the police hunkered down in their precincts struggling vainly to establish law and order among a hostile population.

Looking at the past weeks’ upheaval in Ferguson, Missouri, I see seven parallels to the bad old days of my youth.

1) The disconnect between the police and the people. In Fort Apache, the Bronx, based on the real-life 41st Precinct in the South Bronx, the problem was a police force that was virtually all non-Hispanic trying to patrol a Puerto Rican neighborhood. But the bigger racial divide of the era was between blacks and whites. In the decades prior to the 1970s, about a third of the blacks in the South moved (for understandable reasons) to Northern cities, but the composition of city governments and police forces lagged behind.

Megan McArdle explains how a similar thing has been happening recently in the suburbs, which is how Ferguson ended up with a white city council and mostly white police force that is resented by many among the town’s relatively recent black majority.

And it goes both ways. The police tend to feel as if the city they grew up in is being overrun by people they’re not accustomed to and don’t like. Which leads me to the second parallel.

2) The siege mentality of the police. In the face of rising crime, and with a lack of connection to the people they’re policing, the cops see themselves as the “thin blue line” separating decent people from anarchy. The over-militarization of the police, which many people have complained about after seeing photos of suburban cops in full battle rattle, is just a symptom. The underlying problem is that the police feel like occupiers trying to suppress a native insurgency. That’s why they called the 41st precinct “Fort Apache,” after an Arizona cavalry garrison that fought off Apache warriors in the Old West.

Breaking this siege mentality, by the way, was one of the lessons about how to break the late 20th-century crime wave. While aggressive policing methods, including some that have been denounced as intrusive (like “stop and frisk”), are part of the success in places like New York City, this was coupled with increased engagement with the community.

Law and order is an enormous value, and if you provide it to people, they will appreciate it. But law and order in a free society has to be based on earning the trust of the public.

3) Opportunistic politicians. That’s why we cringe when we see the usual race-baiters like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton descend on Ferguson. They’re there to inflame the situation and take advantage of the resentment of the locals to boost their own reputations and political power. And the most inflammatory thing they do is to promote the next big element of the 1960s mentality.

4) The whole system is out of order. No, Al Pacino never quite said that, but it has gone done in popular imagination as the summation of the prevailing attitude of the 1970s. Grievances like the shooting of Michael Brown are used not to reform the system but to delegitimize the system.

That’s the key to whole Ferguson fiasco, and it’s the biggest parallel to the 1960s and 70s. Police abuses, or alleged police abuses, are presented by the political left as an indictment of America as institutionally racist and hopelessly immoral. So what’s the point of waiting for a case to be heard in court, demanding reform of the local police, or waiting for the next municipal election to vote more responsive candidates into office? The whole system is out of order and needs to be torn down.

That’s what explains the riots in Ferguson. You don’t keep rioting because you want justice, certainly not when you’ve already brought the case to everyone’s attention and gained the nation’s sympathy. No, you riot because you feel that all authority has been knocked down, that the whole system is rotten and that there is nothing to stop you from smashing everything and taking whatever you want. Notice the way in which the rioters have threatened reporters, who are, after all, attempting to document them in the process of committing serious crimes. Only a kind of comprehensive delegitimizing of the system can produce this result.

That’s also why we’re getting a whiff of justice by revolutionary tribunal, in which the guilt of the officer who shot Michael Brown has already been determined.

In fact, as I predicted, most of the facts everyone supposedly knew within the first 24 hours of the shooting of Michael Brown have been significantly revised. For example, it turns out that Brown was not an angelic aspiring college student, but a criminal. And not a sympathetic petty criminal but a thug caught on tape earlier that day committing a strong-arm robbery against a convenience store clerk. (Those who call this “shoplifting” are ignorant of legal definitions. This was strong-arm robbery in the most literal sense, as you can see from the surveillance footage of Brown grabbing a guy half his size and shoving him around.) This is relevant because it lends some plausibility to the idea that Brown might have later initiated a conflict with a police officer. It also casts some doubt on the most inflammatory eye-witness account in this case, which was offered by the friend who was with Brown at the time, who apparently left out the part about how he and Big Mike had spent the afternoon mugging store clerks.

Yes, police officers sometimes lie. In Ferguson, as other reports indicate, they might lie more often then most. But criminals lie, too. So let’s just stipulate that everything everyone says in this case will need to be backed up thoroughly by independent witnesses and physical evidence.

On that grounds, it’s not looking good. There are reports (still disputed) that the officer who shot Brown was seriously injured in the altercation, and even some inadvertently captured eye-witness testimony that Brown may have advanced on the officer rather than being shot in the back, which is consistent with autopsy results showing all his wounds in the front.

No, none of this creates a presumption in favor of the officer, but it undermines the presumption in favor of Brown. There’s good reason to be skeptical of everyone, and we’re going to have to wait a good while longer before we can get a systematic and impartial accounting of all the relevant facts in court.

But the protesters and media have already convicted the officer by revolutionary tribunal and will never believe any other outcome. Why? Because the whole system is out of order.

5) Whataboutism. Every bad actor in the world—people who routinely jail reporters, beat protesters, shut down newspapers, behead people, and kill their own citizens by the trainload—every damn one of them starts to lecture us about how bad we are. To date, in ascending order of evil, we’ve heard an earful about Ferguson from the Russians and the military junta in Egypt, Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei, and the lovely gentlemen of ISIS.

Back in the Cold War, we had a term for this: “whataboutism.” Whenever anyone criticized the Soviets about the gulags, their mouthpieces would start a sentence with “What about…” and go on to talk about racism and poverty and whatever bad thing they could think of that was happening in the United States. They understood that when the left sets out to delegitimize our system, they always seem to end up legitimizing the world’s real bad guys.

6) A pro-cop backlash. I was struck by comments from The Federalist‘s Ben Domenech about how this case has divided conservatives and libertarians in their attitude toward the police.

Do you naturally tend to trust them, viewing them as a necessary and needed hedge acting in defense of law and order? Or are you naturally suspicious of them, believing them to be little more than armed tax collectors and bureaucrats with a tendency to violence and falsehood in service of their whims?

This is a bit of a false alternative. You can think that the police are a vital necessity while still thinking that they need to be carefully monitored and brought to justice if they overstep their bounds.

Yet this divide in attitudes is real. This is partly because libertarianism has always had an anarchist undertone. The modern libertarian movement emerged from that same late-20th-century era when the whole system was out of order and both the military and the police were viewed as bad guys. The early libertarians participated in the delegitimizing of the system, imagining that this would somehow bring about a stateless libertarian utopia.

No, I don’t think most young libertarians embrace this attitude or have thought it out thoroughly, and that’s why I think there’s a generational element to this. I’m just old enough to remember the tail end of the great crime wave of the 1970s, a spree of murder, robbery, rape, and general mayhem that wrecked America’s inner cities for decades. (Some of them have never recovered.) I remember the news being filled with sensational murders, random muggings, drive-by shootings, and the general sense that the criminals were taking over the streets. Take a look at this graph, which charts an eight-fold increase in total violent crime from 1960 to 1990. At the time, I can assure you that we had no idea crime rates would drop precipitously afterwards. We thought the line might just keep sloping upward.

People my age remember the stunning turnaround. We remember how Rudy Giuliani was reviled and denounced—including by the same people exploiting the Ferguson tragedy—even as he adopted policing tactics that turned New York City from a murder capital into one of the safest places in the nation.

So all of the new complaints about how we have too many people in jail and how police are too militarized “despite” the fall in crime rates are courting the Fox Butterfield Effect. They don’t recognize that one of the reasons for falling crime is precisely because we have put more bad guys in prison and given more resources to the police.

So that’s why those of us who still remember that era have a more positive view of the cops. They saved us from fear and chaos. And even a few black commentators have had the courage to mention this, because they, too, were saved from fear. When the cities went downhill, many whites fled to the safe streets of the suburbs, while blacks were stuck living in the inner city.

So when I hear young libertarians casually jump onto the anti-police bandwagon, I partly think that these whippersnappers grew up with safe streets—they’re maybe a decade younger than me, but the crime wave broke so sharply that those few years made a big difference—so they’re not as likely to appreciate the “thin blue line.” Whereas I’m from a previous generation that saw the rising tide of crime and fantasized about the kind of cops who would ask the punks if they felt lucky.

That said, I’ve also lived in Chicago, where the police are callous, officious, and opposed to individual self-defense—while pretty much failing to provide public safety. I also understand how the drug war has not only fueled crime in the big cities—a huge portion of the murders in places like Chicago are the product of warfare between rival gangs, just as in the first era of Prohibition—and it has also contributed to the militarization of the police, who up-armor themselves to fight against well-armed gangs.

But remembering the history of the great crime wave helps us guard against presuming the guilt of the police in a case like this one.

There’s one last, tragic parallel to the old crime wave era.

7) The self-destruction of Ferguson. What we can expect next for Ferguson is probably what we saw in the big cities in the wake of the crime wave. The white middle class—and some of the black middle class, too—speeds up its exodus, and businesses whose operations have been disrupted for weeks decide to pull out.

How much luck do you think the Ferguson Chamber of Commerce is going to have for the next ten years? Ferguson was already under-banked, with more check-cashing outfits and sketchy payday lenders than regular bank branches. How many people are going to be eager to open up new shops along West Florissant Avenue, the epicenter of the riots?

How soon are they going to rebuild the QuikTrip? The most poignant part of that story is the conscientious young man who decided to come to work that day, despite the air of menace in the town, because he “he loves his job”—and barely escaped with his life when the store was looted and burned. Will he have any job to return to? In the first go-around, in the 60s and 70s, the answer was frequently, “no.”

That’s the real crime of the rioters. In an attempt to force the authorities to meet their demands, they’re engaging in the self-immolation of their own community. Then again, there are always those who would rather rule in hell than be just another law-abiding sucker in heaven.

Michael Barone, who was there as a reporter the first time around, says this isn’t quite like the 60s—but mostly because it’s smaller. That’s what makes this 20th Century Lite. The first time around, Ferguson was practically every big Northern city. This time around, it’s one Midwestern suburb.

But this is a warning that we need to re-learn the lessons of the 20th century. The police need to be reformed to overcome the Fort Apache mentality—and the rest of us need to recognize the destructiveness of the left’s race-baiting and its attempts to delegitimize and tear down the whole system of law and order.

The Ferguson-9/11 Nexus,"As the riots and unrest in Ferguson recede, the Obama administration has embarked on a new adventure in Iraq, this time against the Islamic State (ISIS), hitting the terrorist enclave in Iraq with a handful of airstrikes in recent weeks. Although President Obama admitted “we don’t have a strategy yet” for confronting ISIS, the United States nevertheless has begun recruiting a broader coalition of allies to carry out attacks against the group in Syria and widen operations against it in Iraq.

Meanwhile, many Americans have come away from the riots in Ferguson, Missouri deeply disturbed by the militarization of local police departments, not just in that town but nationwide. Images of cops in armored vehicles training military-grade rifles on unarmed protestors and firing tear gas into crowds struck many as repugnant and alarming—scenes better suited to mass protests in Egypt, Ukraine, or Turkey.

So what does our response to ISIS have to do with the police response to Ferguson? Last week, Peter Suderman of Reason argued the militarized police response in Ferguson directly results from America’s response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. The federal programs that supplied the armored vehicles, body armor, tear gas, rubber bullets, and other military gear in Ferguson were meant to help cops fight terror at the local level.

It’s a bit much to say, as Suderman does, that far from fighting terror, the police in Ferguson “have helped create it,” but it’s certainly true that over the past decade local police departments nationwide have been outfitted with an unprecedented array of military gear and training. Never before have so many cops had so much military hardware as they do now, most of it supplied by the federal government.

The American Street War

Arming cops with heavier firepower began decades ago with the War on Drugs, but Suderman rightly notes that the attacks of 9/11, the War on Terror, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq accelerated the trend by many orders of magnitude:

A federal program began transferring large military grade equipment from the Pentagon to local law enforcement—giving away almost $450 million worth of equipment originally intended for conducting war last year alone. Since 2002, a separate program run by the Department of Homeland Security has provided $35 billion in grants to law enforcement around the country, funding the purchase of tactical gear, storm-trooper-style armor, and mine-resistant vehicles.

Radley Balko has had some fun chronicling the distribution of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected armored personnel vehicles, or MRAPs, to small towns like Dundee, Mich., population 3,600. But it’s not just small towns. Last year, Ohio State University acquired its very own a 19-ton MRAP. It was just one of more than 100 colleges whose campus police are getting military-grade hardware from the Department of Defense.

It became clear that giving military gear to cops just meant more local police departments would form SWAT teams.

The idea is that local cops must be prepared to disrupt terrorist plots and therefore should be trained and equipped accordingly. In the wake of 9/11, when Americans were in shock and afraid there might be more attacks on the way, this reasoning kind of made sense. But as the years wore on, it became clear that giving military gear to cops just meant more local police departments would form SWAT teams—it’s estimated that 80 percent of towns with 25,000 to 50,000 residents now have SWAT teams, up from just 26 percent in 1984—and that they would be more likely to call in the local SWAT team to, say, serve an arrest warrant (never mind that SWAT teams were originally conceived as a special response unit to hostage or active shooter scenarios). The pretense that any of this has anything to do with actual law enforcement has all but disappeared: the federal program doling out the military equipment doesn’t seem to distinguish between areas with high crime rates and those that are relatively safe.

Terrorism Versus Crime

It’s hard to understand this kind of nonchalant police militarization unless you consider that it springs from a specific approach to terrorism and domestic security developed after 9/11 and employed by the last two administrations. Put simply, this approach treats terrorists as criminals and acts of terror as crimes. Law enforcement, not warfare, has become the framework for America’s response to terrorism at home and abroad. Hence, the National Security Agency’s (NSA’s) domestic spying program, the security theater of the Transportation Security Administration, the militarization of local police, and so on.

Fighting terrorism then becomes a matter of law enforcement for the host country but remains, as it should, a matter of diplomacy and warfare for the United States.

It wasn’t always this way. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our leaders did not contemplate their response as an exercise in law enforcement, or that terrorism was merely a criminal-justice issue. President George W. Bush vowed the United States would “make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.” Accordingly, the United States delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban: hand over Osama bin Laden or face immediate attack. The Bush administration also gave an ultimatum to Pakistan, which had a long history of accommodating the Taliban. Two days after the attacks, Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, handed Pakistan’s intelligence chief a list of seven demands, which included breaking ties with the Taliban, stopping al-Qaeda operations on the Pakistani border, and granting American forces access to Pakistani bases and airspace. According to former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, the demands came with a promise that if his country did not comply, the United States would “bomb it back to the Stone Age.”

Here was an entirely different response to terrorism that placed the responsibility for dealing with terrorists on the terror groups’ host regimes: if you do not take care of this problem, we will make war—not only on the terrorists, but also on you, Musharraf, or you, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and topple your regime. According this approach, any leader wishing to preserve his regime is co-opted to fight terrorist groups operating inside his country and dismantle any terrorist networks—even ones the regime itself may have helped establish. Fighting terrorism then becomes a matter of law enforcement for the host country but remains, as it should, a matter of diplomacy and warfare for the United States.

Angelo Codevilla has written at length about this approach to fighting terrorism as the only way to end America’s “permanent war footing” and “restore the respect and geopolitical balance on which peace depends.”

Ending ‘permanent war footing,’ ever so essential for any nation’s sustainability, requires being honest about who threatens us, and putting them out of action while not bothering others. The Bush and Obama Administrations, each for its own reasons, preferred to pretend that our problem consisted of bands of rogues extraneous to any authorities. Both Administrations tried and failed to identify and police such rogues in alien lands while so wrapping America in ‘security measures’ as to make it almost unrecognizable. That way lies permanent war with foreigners and strife amongst ourselves.

Police Abroad, Military At Home

Unfortunately, the Bush administration never really followed through on its promise to hold regimes accountable, or else. Instead, it gradually adopted a law-enforcement strategy for containing al-Qaeda abroad while militarizing law enforcement at home—an approach the Obama administration has maintained.

Holding regimes accountable for terrorism is an infinitely better policy than attempting to police terrorists ourselves because it doesn’t require the creation of a massive security and domestic surveillance apparatus.

But for a democracy, holding regimes accountable for terrorism is an infinitely better policy than attempting to police terrorists ourselves because it doesn’t require the creation of a massive security and domestic surveillance apparatus. The problem with the creation of such an apparatus, designed to disrupt terror plots beforehand and ferret out potential terrorists among us, is that sooner or later it will be turned on the very civilian population it was meant to protect. Between the domestic spying programs of the NSA and the militarization of police departments nationwide, we are now witnessing this process begin to play out here in the United States

If we choose to fight terrorists at home and try to police them abroad, instead of bringing the fight to them and holding their host regimes accountable, we should expect more of the kind of domestic militarization we’ve lately seen in Ferguson. And if the Obama administration’s failure to devise a strategic response to ISIS continues to manifest itself in equivocal and intermittent airstrikes that stop short of destroying the fledgling terrorist state, then we should not be surprised to see boots on the ground—not in Syria or Iraq, but here at home.

Ferguson Could Lead To Federal Takeovers Of Local Police,"In response to a white police officer shooting Michael Brown in Missouri, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced a broader civil rights probe into the Ferguson Police Department—an action that could lead to a federal takeover of the police.

While such probes might not lead to Department of Justice punishment for past local police conduct, it could pave the way for “systemic legal reform going forward,” according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

“It’s very serious,” Toobin said of the investigation, before it was formally announced, “because it can lead to a virtual federal takeover of the police, as happened recently in New Orleans.”

After Brown’s death, the DOJ descended on Ferguson similarly to its response to the Trayvon Martin shooting in Florida in 2012. Then, DOJ sent its Civil Rights public relations unit—the Community Relations Service (CRS)—to act as “peacemakers.”

But talking wasn’t all CRS did in Florida, and it’s not all in Missouri, either. According to Ferguson Mayor James Knowles, who spoke with the Daily Caller last month, CRS “protest marshals” helped train people demonstrating against police over the shooting.

These are the same people Holder called on after the Ferguson shooting to promote greater diversity in the police departments: “Justice Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community…Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.”

Diffusing, or Provoking, Hate Crimes?

The official mission of the CRS, which was created as part of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, “is to help local communities address community conflicts and tensions arising from disputes, disagreements, or difficulties over race, color, and national origin.”

It seems the Community Relations Service is more concerned with agitating than peacemaking.

Its powers were broadened in 2009 by President Obama when he signed into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The new law gave the CRS—a small, little-known unit in the DOJ—the power to “develop strategies and respond to violent hate crimes.” According to the DOJ’s website, “Through this law, we will strengthen the protections against crimes based on the color of your skin, the faith in your heart, or the place of your birth. We will finally add federal protections against crimes abased on gender, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.”

This is the same unit Breitbart News caught participating in protests at the Republican National Convention in 2012, where “a CRS representative and a protester” were seen “to high-five each other.” According to Breitbart, CRS representatives were also “seen relaying specific instructions to the activists about the location of prearranged buses that were apparently taking them to their next scheduled demonstration.”

It seems CRS is more concerned with agitating than peacemaking—which contradicts their promise of remaining “neutral.” So, when they showed up in Ferguson, it wasn’t surprising that protests escalated and now Holder is launching more probes to weed out civil-rights violations in Ferguson. Since Holder failed to make the Brown shooting a civil-rights issue, he now needs to advance his agenda another way by broadening the issue to anecdotal complaints by citizens to the CRS about racial injustices.

We Can Fix You

According to Holder, the “conversations” the CRS and its “peacemakers” had with people in the community have revealed extensive racial injustices in the police department—especially its lack of diversity. This has given Holder the green light to open a probe.

‘People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices, and from the lack of diversity on Ferguson’s police force.’

“Over the course of that visit, I had the chance to speak with a number of local residents. I heard from them directly about the deep mistrust that has taken hold between law enforcement officials and members of the community. In meetings and listening sessions—as well as informal conversations—people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices, and from the lack of diversity on Ferguson’s police force.”

“These anecdotal accounts underscored the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention. As a result of this history—and following an extensive review of documented allegations and other available data—we have determined that there is cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation to determine whether Ferguson Police officials have engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of the U.S. Constitution or federal law.”

“Our investigation will assess the police department’s use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches, and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson’s city jail, in addition to other potentially discriminatory policing techniques and tactics that are brought to light.”

Focus On Race More—Or Else

When Holder called on police departments to check their “diversity problem,” he wasn’t talking only to those in Missouri. Police departments across the nation have responded by taking a harder look at their diversity in wake of the shooting in Ferguson.

Since more than 50 percent of murders are committed by blacks, it’s not surprising that more of them die in police shootings.

In Charlotte, North Carolina, police statistics show the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) has become more diverse in recent years, but the department still doesn’t “reflect the racial makeup of Charlotte”: “Fifty percent of the people who live in Charlotte are white, according to the latest census data; 35 percent are black and 13.1 percent are Hispanic.” Such disparities are common across the country, but with Holder and the CRS breathing down their necks, police departments are sure to hire more minorities.

As the Charlotte police chief said: “We have to be deliberate in targeting minorities [in hiring]. Now our strategy is focusing on an obligation—what they can do to help their community. How do we get away from the stigma of, ‘I don’t want to associate with the police.’”

This diversity “obligation” seems to be rooted in the assumption that the greatest threat to blacks is white police officers. This, however, is not the case. The leading cause of death for African-American males is murder—and not by police, but by “other black men.” The raw numbers show more whites are killed by police officers than blacks, because there are more whites in the population (five to one). When you factor this in, the death rate for blacks due to “legal intervention” is more than three times higher than whites. But once again, you have to look at the broader picture, and since more than 50 percent of murders are committed by blacks, it’s not surprising that more of them die in police shootings.

According to Human Events, “In New York from January to June 2008, 83 percent of all gun assailants were black, according to witnesses and victims, though blacks were only 24 percent of the population. Blacks and Hispanics together accounted for 98 percent of all gun assailants. Forty-nine of every 50 muggings and murders in the Big Apple were the work of black or Hispanic criminals.” How many of these facts will be taken into consideration in Holder’s quest for diversity? Not much, it seems.

The problem, according to Holder, is lack of diversity, and the unit on the front lines to root out Civil Rights violations appears to be the CRS.

An Opening for Federal Takeover

If Toobin is right, and the DOJ investigations could be a pathway for the federal government to take over local police departments, then the role of the CRS and its “conversations” with local officials and activist groups is significant.

Why have the full power and force of the U.S. Department of Justice behind a community relations unit?

Imagine this scenario: Anytime there is a police shooting or any interaction between a white police officer and a non-white person, the CRS swoops in to agitate the situation. Protests ensue. Investigations are done, and police departments are examined to see if they are diverse enough. When they’re not, either the feds bring civil-rights lawsuits against them or step in to run the show because the local police department can’t be trusted to protect minorities. The result is a slow but effective takeover of local law enforcement by the federal government—all in the name of diversity and civil rights, propelled by the involvement of a seemingly benign organization—the CRS—that is supposed to be a neutral “peacemaker.”

Those who say a group like CRS is necessary to help ease racial tensions need to explain why this must occur at the federal level. Why have the full power and force of the U.S. Department of Justice behind a community relations unit? Why threaten a takeover of local law enforcement by the federal government—something that is a greater threat to our liberties in the long run than too many white people in police departments?

Local community race relations groups are already in place doing this job. The Community Relations Committee in Mecklenburg County, for example, is a human relations agency of the city and county—not the federal government. They mirror the mission of the CRS at the local level. Why then, does this federal agency, the CRS, need to do what locals are already doing?

It’s an Excuse for a Power Grab

The answer lies in the design and goals of the Obama administration and Holder’s DOJ, which seem to have little regard for local governments or checks and balances, and are continuing to push the boundaries of federal authority, using racial relations, diversity, and civil rights issues as the excuse.

The Founders understood that consolidation, or bringing all powers into one fold, would inevitably lead to corruption.

Why is this a problem? Why shouldn’t the federal government take control of all local police departments? Because centralized power threatens liberty. As Thomas Jefferson said, “When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.”

The Founders purposely wrote into the Constitution a system of checks and balances in which there would be the federal government with limited powers, and state and local governments with indefinite powers. Local police are part of local governments and play an integral role in the dispersion of power. Imagine if the national government, not local municipalities, controlled all police forces throughout the country. What if all we had was a national police force? Who would stand against the totalitarian state, who would defend the cities and the individual against a consolidated, arbitrary power?

State and local governments are supposed to have sovereignty. Integral to that is a police force accountable to that local community. If the federal government takes over local police departments, local governments lose an integral part of their sovereignty, which puts individuals—who are protected by the dispersion of force—at risk.

We need to heed Jefferson’s warnings. He passionately opposed consolidation of force, because the “greatest calamity” that Americans can face is “submission to a government of unlimited powers.” The Founders understood that consolidation, or bringing all powers into one fold, would inevitably lead to corruption. They understood what we need to remember—that absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Did A Texas Jury Send The Right Baby Killer To Death Row?,"In 2005, a Texas jury concluded that Manuel Velez had viciously murdered his girlfriend’s baby. Their verdict sent him to Texas’s death row.

Earlier that year on Halloween 2005, the day before Angel Moreno’s first birthday, his blended family began their day at home. Acela Moreno, 25, an illegal immigrant; her three small children (all by different men); Velez, 40, her boyfriend of four months; and Velez’s son by another woman ate breakfast together. Angel began crying. Velez picked Angel up and shook him, Moreno told the jury. When Angel continued crying, Velez brought him into the bedroom, shook him again, and put him to sleep, she said.

Later that afternoon, Moreno put Angel on the living room couch next to four-year-old half-sister Emily while she put his two-year-old half-brother, Alexis, down for a nap. Twenty minutes later, while lying next to Alexis, Moreno heard noises in the other bedroom: Three strong breaths, some blowing, and then water running in the bathroom. She met Velez at Alexis’s bedroom door. He was visibly upset, and told her something was wrong with Angel. Moreno rushed to her baby, and discovered he had stopped breathing. She shouted at Velez to do something.

“What can I do?” he asked, alarmed. Moreno told him to borrow the neighbor’s phone to call 911.

Their next-door neighbor, Veronica Aparicio, heard Moreno screaming outside. Aparicio stepped outside and saw Moreno holding Angel’s limp, pale body. Velez asked to use Aparicio’s phone because the baby was “choking.” She immediately handed it over. He returned it a few moments later, saying it didn’t work. That made her suspicious and, as she dialed 911 herself, Aparicio noticed that Velez “did not look worried as a person should be in that situation.”

Acela Moreno rushed to her baby, and discovered he had stopped breathing.

When Constable Lt. Jesus Coria arrived on the scene several minutes later, he, too, saw Moreno wailing loudly, with Angel “dangling” in her arms. It took him several minutes to take Angel from her, and the “distraught” mother could give him no helpful information. Coria performed CPR until firemen arrived, and they continued until an ambulance arrived to rush Angel to the hospital.

“But where is [Velez]?” the prosecutor’s appellate brief asks. “What is [he] hiding that he refuses to dial 911 and lies about the phone not working? Why is [he] not stepping in and giving the required information to a uniformed police officer who is doing his best to save Baby Angel’s life, a child residing in [his] household and who is in his care, custody, and control? Where is [Velez]? [He], according to Lt. Coria, is standing in the background, watching, with his arms crossed.” Several other police officers also testified in court that Velez acted “indifferent” and never asked about Angel’s condition.

At the hospital, doctors discovered massive internal bleeding and fractures within Angel’s head. His brain and skull literally bled him to death. Doctors placed little Angel on life support. He never woke up.

A Home Full of Chaos

A one-year-old baby had died, violently. But how? And who did it?

As doctors worked in vain to resuscitate Angel, Velez and Moreno agreed to visit the sheriff’s department for questioning. There, Velez admitted that he had bit Angel three days before, while “playing with him.” He had also “pulled” and “smashed” Angel’s nose with his hand. On the day of Angel’s death, Velez said he laid on the bed while throwing Angel into the air and catching him. He called this playing, too, but admitted it and “squeezing Angel a little hard” the week previous could have caused the bruises doctors observed on Angel’s ribs.

Not only did Manuel Velez admit he had injured Angel, he had motive for inflicting death-inducing injuries.

The state connected the dots this way: Not only did Velez admit he had injured the child, he had motive for inflicting death-inducing injuries. Angel’s father, Juan Chavez, was Velez’s foe. He had beaten Velez’s girlfriend and threatened Velez after discovering their relationship, which began before Moreno broke up with Chavez. Surely, Velez was taking out his anger towards Chavez on Chavez’s son. Besides, Velez himself testified that Angel’s white skin “caused him to get anxious.”

Moreno and Velez had lived together from July through September 2005, when Velez left for a job in Memphis. After Velez left, Moreno was evicted from their apartment for failing to pay rent, so she moved in with a friend. Velez returned from Memphis on October 14, and rented a new home for the entire family.

That’s four different homes that Angel, Emily, and Alexis, lived in during the four months between his unmarried parents’ breakup and his death. Four days after Velez had returned from Memphis, Angel attended a checkup where, his pediatrician testified, he had showed no injuries. After Velez returned from Memphis in September, injuries began to appear on Baby Angel’s body, Moreno testified, including cigarette and cigarette lighter burns, bite marks, and abrasions.

Angel’s Deathly Head Injuries

The doctor who performed an autopsy on Angel after his death found violent contact with a blunt object had caused skull fractures and brain hemorrhages in two separate episodes. On the day Angel died, examiner Dr. Norma Jean Farley concluded, the first head injury was about seven to 14 days old and the second happened the day his neighbor called 911. The injuries were not like those a child would get from an accident, such as falling off a bed or tripping while learning to walk, she testified: They were consistent with abuse, such as being beaten or slammed against something. A forensic pathologist who testified for the state agreed with Dr. Farley’s assessment.

Why didn’t Acela hear Angel cry if Velez had been beating him that day? Farley said he could have easily been knocked unconscious with one blow.

For the jury, the evidence seemed clear: There were only two adults in the house that day. Velez was the one who was in town when observers noticed Angel had vicious injuries, while absent when Angel had none. And Velez had signed a confession in the presence of police saying that he had, indeed, bit, shaken, and thrown Baby Angel that day. Case closed: death row for the baby killer. Velez was convicted in October 2008 and sent to prison to await a lethal injection.

A Visit to Death Row: ‘This Guy Actually Might Be Innocent’

Affiliated law firms in Colorado and Texas had been looking for a pro-bono death penalty case to challenge, and fellow lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union flagged Velez’s case immediately as one where the convicted man may have been mentally challenged (Velez has a seventh-grade education and speaks broken English).

Attorneys trying to get a guy off death row take as a matter of course that their client is guilty, Neil Berger said. They just want him not to die for his crime.

After reviewing court documents, Texas lawyers Lyndon Bittle and Neil Burger drove the three and a half hours from Dallas to Livingston, Texas, to meet Velez during their first visit to death row. Getting in requires being locked into a cage-like area and patted down, and passing a sign that says “No Hostages Beyond This Point”—meaning, if you’re taken hostage, you’re not getting out. Guards bring inmates in wearing shackles on one side a thick glass window with a telephone on either side as the only means of contact.

Paper money is not allowed, but “you show up with a roll of quarters so you can buy your client a Dr. Pepper,” Burger said. Visitors—mostly parents—line up along the approximately 20 visitation cubicles. The two lawyers spent six hours with Velez—more than his court-appointed lawyers had in their three years together. They communicated in Spanglish this time, and later brought lawyers who knew Spanish fluently.

“A lot of that first visit was to gain his trust,” Burger said. “Velez was extremely let down by his attorneys. He couldn’t believe where he was. He claimed he was innocent. He couldn’t believe he could be convicted of something he didn’t do. I remember when I left, thinking, ‘Wow, this guy actually might be innocent.’”

Attorneys trying to get a guy off death row take as a matter of course that their client is guilty, Berger said. They just want him not to die for his crime.

It took three years for a pack of lawyers to compile a 392-page habeus corpus brief to the state. It argued Velez had received utterly incompetent counsel, was prosecuted by a district attorney and convicted by a judge who were themselves convicted of throwing the book at defendants who wouldn’t pay them bribes, and submitted new evidence from ten expert medical witnesses that suggested Velez was actually innocent. Those are just the highlights.

The First Speaker Seems Right—Until His Cross-Examination

As for Angel, the copious evidence Velez’s pro-bono team dug up indicated he was indeed a victim of constant abuse—by his mother. It started before Angel’s birth, as a neighbor testified Moreno smoked and drank copiously while pregnant with him. Another neighbor who regularly used the Velez family shower while her running water was out testified that Moreno “would stay in bed all morning. She never changed the diapers of her children and never fed or bathed them. Manuel performed these tasks and cooked for the children every day.” Two other neighbors corroborated these descriptions.

In July 2005, Salazar saw Moreno drinking alcohol while holding Angel and a cigarette. As Moreno tried to walk down the stairs to her apartment, she fell and dropped the baby.

More disturbing are reports from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which took the children from Moreno twice in a fourteen-month span. One of the children’s foster parents reported that little Alexis was “a biter” who bit other children, including his siblings. Moreno’s next-door neighbor said Angel’s mother would scream and throw things at her children—once, neighbor Ivonne Salazar saw Moreno hit Emily with a shoe. When one of Manuel’s other children stayed with Moreno, she locked the six-year-old in the closet, his mother reported. Velez told the police Moreno “has hit her kids pretty bad including the baby,” and once she pushed Emily against a ceramic statue, making Emily’s head bleed.

In July 2005, Salazar saw Moreno drinking alcohol while holding Angel and a cigarette. As Moreno tried to walk down the stairs to her apartment, she fell and dropped the baby. In August 2005, Brownsville emergency services arrived at Salazar’s home, where she and two other neighbors had seen Moreno pick up Emily by the arm and throw her into a tiger statue, which cut Emily’s head again. Moreno was angry because the toddler had paint in her hair. She refused medical treatment on Emily’s behalf.

The neighbors also testified that Moreno would leave Angel on the couch, sometimes telling Emily to watch him, although little Emily—a preschooler, remember—frequently dropped her brother. He also often fell from the couch onto the floor. Moreno’s sister testified that Moreno had admitted to biting Angel while Velez was in Memphis. During her interrogation with police, Moreno admitted that “perhaps” she had burned Angel with a cigarette. His autopsy showed a raw burn mark on his foot, and several neighbors likewise said they had regularly seen cigarette burns on baby Angel.

None of this evidence was presented to the jury in Velez’s case. His lawyers did not even demand their client’s right to things like the ability to be present during negotiations about the case and private discussions of objections during the trial. They did not present testimony demonstrating Velez could not speak English and so had no idea what was in the confessional papers police pushed at him to sign. During the trial, the prosecutor actually took a baby doll, held it by its legs, and slammed it on the table repeatedly as he discussed Angel’s abuse: “If I was representing him, I would have been all over that objecting,” Burger said. Indeed, in the first favorable judicial activity on Velez’s case, Brownsville District Court Judge Elia Lopez agreed the evidence showed that his court-appointed representation was negligent to the point of incompetence, and approved a retrial in April 2013.

‘A life in [poverty-stricken] Cameron County is worth just as much as a life elsewhere.’

“We have a society that, the differences between rich and poor in society are pretty stark, and it gets reflected in the judicial system,” Bittle said, discussing how a person’s ability to defend himself in the judicial system essentially depends on his ability to pay for legal counsel. Some court-appointed lawyers are sharp, and some stand by while the opposition’s lawyers slam baby dolls on the table. People who are poor or don’t speak English well can’t supplant a lackluster defense with money or connections. The two law firms involved estimate they spent 11,000 man-hours worth $3.5 million on Velez’s case. Velez’s profession? Day laborer, and sometimes fix-it man.

In Lopez’s order granting a retrial, Burger noted, “there is a line in there that says a life in [poverty-stricken] Cameron County is worth just as much as a life elsewhere.”

Who Slammed Baby Angel’s Head?

Perhaps the most gaping hole in Velez’s defense was that his lawyers never called their own medical witnesses to counter the state’s strongest point, the medical testimony agreeing that the head injuries that caused Angel’s death could only have been inflicted when Velez was in town. The pro-bono team sent Angel’s medical records and autopsy to several doctors with expertise in pediatrics and head injuries. They uncovered evidence that Angel was a sick baby long before the night he died. Although his pediatrician said Angel was healthy at his checkup nearest to Velez’s return from Memphis, the pediatrician never actually saw Angel at this checkup. His practice was too big. A nurse practitioner handled Angel’s checkup.

Angel could have easily died from even a minor fall that exacerbated his massive pre-existing head trauma, or from another bout of abuse. And this evidence could have been teased out of the medical witnesses prosecutors called against Velez during the trial.

Also perhaps because of that, the pediatrician apparently overlooked an alarming increase in Angel’s head circumference between doctor’s visits in June and August 2005. Angel went from a head circumference in the fiftieth percentile to one above the ninetieth percentile in three months. “Such a dramatic growth in such a short period indicated a serious condition—either hydrocephalus, a brain tumor, or severe head trauma—and standard pediatric protocol required further tests to determine its cause,” says the habeus corpus brief. Angel received no further tests, let alone treatment, even though his medical records show he was under medical care almost constantly—for sores on his mouth, fevers, coughs, colds, pinkeye, respiratory infections, stomach infection, lung infection, and constipation.

Especially notable to doctors in conjunction with the head ballooning were Angel’s repeated hospitalizations for violent, constant vomiting. We’re talking vomiting that lasted as long as five days. Those two symptoms, plus reports from friends and neighbors that Angel “was a slow baby” who rarely blinked and often would not respond to people, indicated to the pro-bono team’s doctors that Angel had a serious, long-term head injury.

Crucially, the more experienced experts Velez’s new defenders called agreed, after reviewing the medical evidence, that Angel had a slow-moving brain hemorrhage caused by two earlier incidents that could only have happened during the time period Velez was working 900 miles away from Angel, in Memphis. Angel could have easily died from even a minor fall that exacerbated his massive pre-existing head trauma, or from another bout of abuse. This eevidence could have been teased out of the medical witnesses prosecutors called against Velez during the trial, and was implied in their reports (they concluded the onset window of the existing hemorrhage was between two weeks and six months), but Velez’s state-appointed defense showed little interest in this linchpin of the case against him.

The Persistent Injustice of Our Justice System

This from page 82 of the habeus corpus application about sums the story: “The story told by the prosecution, shaped to fit the small window of time they identified as the only opportunity Manuel Velez had to abuse Angel, ignored important evidence that was inconsistent with the only story the police or prosecutor ever considered. Instead of actually investigating the event, within hours the police leapt to their judgment, the prosecutor embraced it, and defense counsel, in a display of gross incompetence, never adequately challenged it.”

“It shouldn’t have taken all of this work and our time,” Bittle said. Manuel sat in jail for five years until his release. If top lawyers hadn’t found his case, he would probably still be there, or executed. “I’m glad we have this system, sometimes people will get [good] lawyers who will volunteer, but it doesn’t explain a flawed judicial system that can’t get it right.”Ultimately, courts set Velez free after he accepted a lesser charge, of reckless injury to a child. On October 8, 2014, he walked a free man out of a Huntsville prison that contains an execution chamber. His attorneys fetched him in minivans, and they all drove seven and a half hours to Brownsville, where they partied with Velez’s family—including his two sons, now 15 and 11—before returning to their own homes and day jobs. After serving time for harming her child, a plea deal Moreno made with prosecutors if she agreed to testify against Velez, Moreno was deported. Emily and Alexis now live with Moreno’s sister. This story of man’s near-consignment to an unwarranted death could be one of collective incompetence. Of one unfortunate accident after another. Of a legal system that teems with literally murderous bureaucracy. Or even of a legal and child welfare system that immediately assumes the man of the house must be at fault for all abuse that occurs within it, despite any and all evidence to the contrary. Or of some high-priced lawyers who surprised themselves when they took on a free client with a big case. Or all of the above, and more.“If we’re dealing with a multimillion-dollar commercial lawsuit, we can put this much time and effort into it,” Bittle said. “The difference is most people don’t put this same time and effort into a pro bono case. It’s not a situation that attracts lawyers who have lots of other options.” ‘Instead of actually investigating the event, within hours the police leapt to their judgment, the prosecutor embraced it, and defense counsel, in a display of gross incompetence, never adequately challenged it.’",https://thefederalist.com/2014/11/24/did-a-texas-jury-send-the-right-baby-killer-to-death-row/,2014-11-24
Dear Media: How Not to Screw Up the Next Ferguson,"I hate to say, “I told you so.” No, really, I hate it. The city of Ferguson, Missouri, is in flames yet again as angry mobs—largely composed of outside agitators—vent their rage against “the system” after a grand jury refused to indict a white police officer for shooting a young black man. All of that destruction could have been prevented if the media knew its own business and didn’t need constant reminders from people like me about how to report on the use of deadly force.

Specifically, I warned them about Zimmerman Amnesia, the dogged failure to learn from the media’s mistakes in reporting previous cases.

[H]ere we go making all of the same mistakes we made in the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case, where reporters did their usual bang-up job of writing the story first and then gathering the facts—only to see much of the early narrative about the shooting dissolve before the case even reached trial. Everyone was shocked when a supposedly open-and-shut case ended with an acquittal, even though it was clear that many of the details were ambiguous and left room for reasonable doubt. Which made that case little different from hundreds of others involving the use of deadly force….



We ought to know from past experience how horribly inaccurate early reports about violent incidents can be. We ought to know how much can be distorted, misrepresented, and misunderstood by seemingly official or sympathetic sources on all sides, how long it can take for accurate information to come out, and how equivocal the results can be, with the evidence so evenly balanced as to convince partisans on both sides that they are right. But when every new politically charged shooting comes along, we forget what we should have learned, and there we all go, back to making confident pronouncements about who we think did what, who is the villain, and what is the remedy.

That’s exactly what happened. The early reports were very clear that Michael Brown was a good, kind-hearted young man bound for college, that the shooting was totally unprovoked, that he was shot multiple times in the back, that he was executed in cold blood. Then the evidence, as it emerged, knocked down each of these claims one by one.

Cases involving the use of force tend to be messy, and getting at the facts is difficult. It requires a lot of sorting of competing claims, cross-examination and confrontation of witnesses, and a thorough review of the physical evidence, which often refutes the eyewitness testimony.

In my initial reaction to this case, I only got one thing wrong. I assumed it would eventually go to trial. Instead, the case collapsed so completely under scrutiny that it never even produced an indictment. Yet what I found interesting about prosecutor Bob McCulloch’s statement is that he emphasized how thorough the grand jury’s deliberations were, how he gave them access to all the evidence, how they questioned witnesses, how they were not influenced by press reports, how they deliberated over the case for a long time. This is not the usual purpose of a grand jury. A grand jury is not there to sift through all of the evidence and try the whole case. They’re just there to make sure that there is some evidence, enough to indicate that there is probably a valid case, which can then be allowed to go to trial.

The mainstream media has already convinced millions of people that they just know Darren Wilson is guilty and that the whole justice system is racist and corrupt for refusing to throw him in jail for the rest of his life.

But McCulloch clearly implies that he conducted this grand jury hearing as if it were a full trial. This indicates to me that he knew the case against Darren Wilson was very weak and probably wouldn’t make it past the grand jury, and he knew that this would infuriate those who had already convicted Wilson in the court of public opinion. So he made sure that the case did go to trial in its own way. He used the grand jury to create a very thorough record of all the evidence, the kind of record that would emerge from a full trial, and which can now be released to the public.

But much of the damage is already done. The venal, incompetent mainstream media has already convinced millions of people that they just know Darren Wilson is guilty and that the whole justice system is racist and corrupt for refusing to throw him in jail for the rest of his life.

If the media want to do a better job next time—and that’s a big “if”—I can offer them five basic rules that they ought to have followed in this case. A lot of small business owners along Florissant Street in Ferguson would be better off if they had.

1. It’s not a story until there are facts (and claims aren’t facts).

Everyone knows the default mode of the media: figure out the story, then gather the facts. But there is a specific way this happens, a way that these cases get off the ground and gain national attention. It’s how reporters and commentators talk themselves into thinking they’re “just covering a story” when they’re already acting as partisans. How it happens is that they start with claims, usually claims made by the family of a young man who has been shot, or by the family’s lawyers, or by “community activists.”

Media people tell themselves that they are just reporting the claims and not taking sides. But the claims are obviously one-sided and extreme—in this case, the claim that Darren Wilson “executed” Michael Brown in cold blood in the middle of the street while Brown was trying to surrender. And once the claim is picked up and trumpeted around at full volume in the press for a week or two, it becomes the default assumption. It becomes the story everyone thinks they know is true.

But the press has merely repeated someone’s claim. It has usually made no effort to validate that claim or check it against independent facts, and usually those facts just aren’t available. So the press tells itself it is being neutral when it is actually broadcasting incendiary and totally unverified claims.

Here are a few rules of thumb for future cases.

Friends and family members of the victim are not unbiased sources. This is totally obvious. Of course they’re biased toward their loved ones. Parents grieving for their child are not going to go on television and say, “Well, he had it coming.” They will not volunteer that their son was troubled or used drugs or was sliding into a life of crime, even if all of those things are true, because that would sound like they are blaming their child for his own death. They are acting out of understandable grief, but it will cause them to make outraged claims about how their boy was “murdered,” regardless of the specific facts of the case, which they probably don’t even know yet. They are acting based on their feelings, which is understandable—for them, but not for the reporters who uncritically broadcast these claims.

Lawyers and “activists” who claim to represent the family are not just biased. They are inherently suspect, and the press should go into the case assuming that these people are going to lie to them. These could be honest people who are just trying to improve their community. But they could also be self-promoting hucksters who are more than eager to promote a lie if it gets them on TV. See “Sharpton, Alfred.”

Eyewitness “testimony” given to the press—i.e., not under oath, with no cross-examination—is meaningless. There is nothing the press loves more than the report of an eyewitness, as given to their own cameras. Unfortunately, this is a great way to pass on totally unreliable information. So the media gave endless play to an initial interview with a friend who said he was present when Michael Brown was shot. The interview was filmed in the office of one of those activist lawyers. Subsequently, every single part of that interview has been shown to be wrong, and the friend rather conspicuously omitted the fact that Brown had robbed a convenience store earlier in the evening.

Read the Ferguson prosecutor’s description of how the eyewitness accounts were often flatly contradicted by physical evidence, how the witnesses changed their stories after they were confronted with the facts, and how some of them ended up admitting that their supposed “eyewitness” testimony was actually just hearsay from around the neighborhood. Then remember all of this the next time you want to make a big national news story out of somebody’s unverified claims.

Am I saying the press should ignore claims of police misconduct? Not at all. They should treat those initial claims as a good lead, but it’s not a real story until they can find objective facts to verify the claims. Which leads me to the second big lesson.

2. Forensics is a science.

These days everybody loves talking about how they love science. Actually loving science is quite another thing.

These days everybody loves talking about how they love science. Actually loving science is quite another thing.

Claims and counterclaims made in the press are not science. Eyewitnesses lie, omit, exaggerate, or misremember. (And yes, that includes police officers.) But analysis of physical evidence is a science. So the real, hard, verifiable facts about a shooting begin with the forensics. They begin with the ballistics, the autopsy, and the physical evidence from the scene. In this case, the first two big facts that were released from the forensic examination were an autopsy which showed that Michael Brown was not shot in the back, refuting multiple eyewitness accounts, and evidence of Brown’s blood being found inside Darren Wilson’s police cruiser, backing up the officer’s claim that Brown attacked him first.

If the media had waited for these actual, verifiable facts to come out, they might have dropped the whole story before it became a national sensation. Because science.

3. People are individuals, not symbols.

People are individuals. Their actions are individual actions. Every case of the use of force is a discrete incident with its own unique facts. It is not an abstract morality tale about racism or poverty or heavy-handed policing.

But of course reporters and commentators had to make this immediately into a “symbol” of race relations in America. They started doing this five seconds after they discovered the story. It is a reflex drummed into them by decades in the media, where every story must be freighted with as much dramatic, life-or-death, world-shaking significance as it can bear, and then some.

Yet once you make this case into a symbol of race relations in America, you make Michael Brown into a symbol of all young black men. And that opens up a whole world of trouble.

If you make Michael Brown into a symbol of all young black men, you cannot let yourselves admit to or report on any negative facts you discover about him, because then those negative things become facts about all young black men. So if you find out that Michael Brown was a thug who roughed up store clerks so he could steal from them—if you actually have video of him doing it—you can’t report that, because then you are saying that all young black men are thugs, which is clearly racist. So you’ve painted yourself into a corner where reporting the facts makes you racist.

The presumption of innocence exists for a reason. Reasonable doubt exists for a reason. Grand juries exist for a reason.

On the other hand, you have also made Darren Wilson into a symbol of all police officers. This creates an incentive for people to rally to his side because they want to defend the police and law and order. There are a lot of us who remember the crime wave of the 70s and 80s, so we’re inclined to cut a little slack to the men on the thin blue line.

Even worse, though, is what you accomplish for those who are inclined to believe Wilson is guilty. Because you’ve made him into a symbol of the entire system, then if he’s guilty, the whole system is corrupt, murderous, and racist and needs to be burned to the ground. So you’ve just validated the worldview of the Ferguson rioters.

You can avoid both traps just by remembering that individuals are not symbols and that every shooting has its own irreducibly concrete facts and context. If you remember that, you can report the facts freely one way or the other without worrying about whether you are promoting or undermining some larger ideological narrative.

4. Legal procedures and privileges exist for a reason.

The presumption of innocence exists for a reason. Reasonable doubt exists for a reason. Grand juries exist for a reason. You might want to take a few minutes to learn what those reasons are.

When a news anchor says, for example, that the Ferguson grand jury “failed” to produce an indictment, he’s indicating that he thinks the system “failed.” No, they didn’t fail. They succeeded at weighing the evidence and deciding whether the case had grounds to move forward. This procedure exists to prevent prosecutors from ruining a man’s life by putting his person and freedom in jeopardy based on insufficient evidence.

What the media is really complaining about in this case is that the grand jury failed to be a rubber stamp for their own presumptive verdict in the case. It may or may not be true, as the old saw has it, that a prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. But the media is incensed that they can’t get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.

That leads me to the last big lesson.

5. You are not the story.

Call this the Geraldo Rivera Effect. No matter what story Geraldo is reporting on, it’s never really about the story. It’s about how bold and resourceful he is to be reporting on it. You can send him to Afghanistan after September 11, as Fox News unwisely did, and he won’t be reporting to you about the dangerous religious fanatics who gave safe haven to al-Qaeda. No, he’ll report to you about how bold and adventurous he is to be forging his way through the mountains of the Hindu Kush in his flak jacket.

In Ferguson, reporters were falling all over themselves to be social justice warriors (to coin a phrase) who would strike a blow against racism and an unjust system. When they cast themselves in this role, they became partisans who were no longer able to admit facts that run contrary to the partisan narrative. I know it’s a lot less glamorous to give up on being a crusader for social justice and just be a guy who reports the facts. But if you’re in the media, that’s your job.

It’s time to learn all of these lessons before the next contentious shooting, because there will be one. In a land of 300 million people, the ordinary course of interactions between public and police will inevitably produce some tragic results. Some of these shootings will turn out to be justified, others won’t. And there is no way of immediately knowing which is which. If the media doesn’t want to be in the position of inciting a riot each time this happens—and again, that’s a big “if”—they need to learn how to do a more responsible job of reporting on the use of force.

I say all of this without much hope that the mainstream media will listen to any of it. It goes against their ideological bias, against their inflated sense of self-regard, and against their short-term economic interests, which favor the person who is first to break the “news” of the latest unverified claim. So I fully expect to be coming back after the next big case, saying “I told you so” again, and running down the same damn list.

Use this instead as a guide for the skeptical reader and viewer, as a way of spotting when you’re being flim-flammed by a premature media frenzy about a sensational case, and to prepare yourself for the inevitable letdown when the facts once again take the air out of the media narrative.

"Hands Up, Don’t Choke: Eric Garner Was Killed By Police For No Reason","On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner was choked to death by a New York City policeman. On December 3, 2014, a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who killed him. And unlike the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, which was murky and muddled at best, Garner’s completely unnecessary death was captured on video.

And what was his crime? As the video below shows (note: it is incredibly disturbing, so watch at your own risk), he wasn’t a mortal threat to anyone. He carried no weapons. He did not shove or attack any police officers in such a way to be considered an imminent threat to their health and safety.

No, his apparent crime was selling cigarettes without paying taxes on them. And for that, he was killed.

The grand jury’s decision not to bring any charges against the officer who killed Garner is inexplicable. It defies reason. It makes no sense. Unlike the Michael Brown case, we don’t have to rely on shaky and unreliable testimony from so-called eyewitnesses. We don’t need to review bullet trajectories or forensics. All we have to do is watch the video and believe our own eyes.

one argument for body cameras is that they might jar the public out of their apathy. here's a terrifying thought: what if they don't?



shrill (@theshrillest) December 3, 2014

New York’s statutes on manslaughter are pretty unequivocal. Just going on the plain language of the law, the police officer who killed Garner certainly appears to be guilty of second-degree manslaughter at the very least:

§ 125.15 Manslaughter in the second degree.

A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when:

1. He recklessly causes the death of another person; or

2. He commits upon a female an abortional act which causes her death,

unless such abortional act is justifiable pursuant to subdivision three

of section 125.05; or

3. He intentionally causes or aids another person to commit suicide.

Manslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony.

The second-degree manslaughter charge requires only two factors: 1) the person charged must have caused the death of the victim, and 2) the perpetrator must have caused the death of the victim via reckless means.

As the video shows, the officer clearly caused the death of Eric Garner, who was alive until the officer put him in a chokehold, a move which is banned by the NYPD for good reason. And why did the police department ban chokeholds? Here’s an article on the subject from 1993, when a previous police chief banned the practice:

The New York City Police Department has issued an order banning the use of choke holds, the restraining maneuvers that cut off the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain and have been blamed in the deaths of suspects here and around the nation.

So an officer used a banned practice that is known to lead to the deaths of people who are subjected to it? That certainly seems to satisfy the second condition of a second-degree manslaughter charge. And again, I have to stress that the entire incident was caught on tape. The evidence is unequivocal. And yet, no indictment.

Why, it’s almost as if the grand jury system is just a convenient means for prosecutors to get the outcome they want wrapped in a veneer of due process. Want to indict a ham sandwich? Consider it indicted. Texas Gov. Rick Perry was indicted for vetoing a spending bill, but a New York prosecutor can’t indict an officer who killed another man in an incident that was completely captured on video? Come on.

John Edwards was right: there are Two Americas. There’s an America where people who kill for no legitimate reason are held to account, and there’s an America where homicide isn’t really a big deal as long as you play for the right team.

Unfortunately Eric Garner was a victim in the second America, where some homicides are apparently less equal than others.

UPDATE: If you’d like additional evidence of my contention that a prosecutor can generally get a grand jury to return whichever outcome the prosecutor wants, check this out:

STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Despite his contention of a frame-up, Ramsey Orta’s testimony didn’t sway a grand jury, which indicted him on weapon charges, stemming from an Aug. 2 arrest, it was revealed in court Friday.



Orta, 22, who filmed an NYPD officer’s fatal chokehold of Eric Garner last month, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in state Supreme Court, St. George.

That’s right. Less than a month after Garner was killed, the same DA’s office tasked with handling his homicide case just happened to get a grand jury indictment against the man who filmed Garner’s homicide.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/12/03/hands-up-dont-choke-eric-garner-was-murdered-by-police-for-no-reason/,2014-12-03
Eric Garner and Omnipresent Police Power,"There are mass protests again about a grand jury’s decision not to indict a police officer in the death of a black man. This time, the protesters might even be right.

It is the second time in a week that this has happened, following the decision by the grand jury in the Ferguson case, but it is interesting to see the different reactions. Commentators and activists on the left assumed in both cases that the white cop was guilty because he was a white cop, regardless of the evidence. Commentators on the right split their decision: most of them agreed with the refusal to indict in Ferguson, but most condemned the refusal to indict in New York. (See The Federalist‘s own Sean Davis, Charles Krauthammer, and many others.) Why the difference? Well, because the facts are different. As I warned, one of the most insidious errors you can make is to turn each case into a symbol of “systemic racism” rather than an individual case to be judged on its own merits.

What did the facts show in the Staten Island case? They don’t show deliberate murder. The video of the police arrest of Eric Garner shows no evidence of malice or specific intent to harm Garner. Rather, it shows a callousness toward his obvious physical distress when the confrontation goes wrong. The killing is less malicious than officious. I mostly agree with Sean Davis, who argues that it was a reckless use of force that caused Garner’s death, which means that there is a good case for prosecuting the policeman responsible on charges of manslaughter.

Despite the damning video that brought the case to national attention, it is not totally cut and dried. The autopsy showed that Garner was already on the run from the grim reaper. The choking action (which may not technically be a “chokehold” but was, er, a hold that choked him) was found to be the primary cause of death, but Garner had major health problems, including asthma. So you could imagine a defense attorney making the case that this just happened to be an unfortunate situation in which a guy resisted arrest and was in such bad shape that he didn’t survive the altercation. There is a conceivable defense that the choking made no difference and Garner would have died anyway just from the stress of resisting arrest. But that’s a defense that ought to be made in court, not pre-emptively endorsed by a grand jury.

That’s why so many on the right have come down on a different side in this case than they did in Ferguson.

So one side makes its decisions on the basis of race, the other makes it decisions on the basis of evidence. No points for guessing which side has been calling the other “racist” for the last week.

Rather than a lot of posing about who’s racist and who isn’t, I’m more interested in what the solutions are for avoiding cases of excessive use of force.

Unsurprisingly, this isn’t what we’re all talking about. An exchange I had on Twitter is pretty typical. When challenged to name a specific reform he wanted to pursue in response to the Ferguson case, he replied “not putting up with s—bag white people like yourself, for one.”

This isn’t about the specifics of the case or any particular kind of reform. It’s about power and control, about some people trying to build up their moral authority by tearing down everybody else’s.

This is earthily expressed, but it pretty much sums up the reaction on the left. This isn’t about the specifics of the case or any particular kind of reform. It’s about power and control, about some people trying to build up their moral authority by tearing down everybody else’s. The big thing I’ve notice from Ferguson is how comfortable folks on the left are becoming at saying that you should shut up because you’re a white man. And that’s not just on Twitter, where people get pumped up by the kind of digital courage that emboldens them to say mean things to distant strangers.

Recently, Pascal-Emanuel Gobry was kind enough to mention a piece I wrote last year about how the Democrats have become so dependent on the support of racial voting blocs that they would need “one Trayvon Martin case after another.” I was referring not to the actual phenomenon of questionable shootings, but to the their exploitation to inflame racial divisions for political advantage. Isn’t that exactly what we’re getting?

But if we want real solutions, we will ask what this case actually tells us.

The thing that strikes me as most important about the Garner case is how stupid the reason was for arresting this guy: he was being busted for selling single, “loose” cigarettes in order to evade heavy taxes on tobacco products. Basically, he was arrested for doing something that, in a previous era, thousands of people would have been doing in New York on any given day: selling goods on the streets of the city without any particular permission. It’s a low-grade form of entrepreneurialism.

But not in the nanny-state New York of today. In a city where everything is taxed and regulated and you can’t put trans-fats in your food or buy a soda that’s too large, it makes perfect sense that they would harass a guy for selling cigarettes on the streets without permission. After all, they’re bad for people. Somebody might die.

This case is a reminder that, as Twitter user Bill Hobbs put it, government is force, and more government equals more force. Government is not a benevolent authority working bloodlessly behind the scenes to ensure seamless social harmony. Government is a guy giving you orders about what you can’t do—with a gun on his hip, handcuffs at the ready, and a muscular arm to wrap around your neck if you resist.

Putting stiff taxes on cigarettes to discourage smoking may sound great, and shouldn’t we do it for the children? But what it means in actual, concrete practice, is this:

Every confrontation between police and citizens has the potential to go wrong and accidentally kill someone. This is actually why I have some sympathy for the police. Their job is to be the instrument of all the laws we pass. So when the law descends from the clouds of benevolent abstraction and becomes a diktat telling specific, actual human beings what to do, the cop’s job is to make good on that diktat by using force against citizens.

We need the police to protect us from criminals. We should be grateful for their presence.

We need the police to protect us from criminals. We should be grateful for their presence, thank them for their service, and remember the presumption of innocence when they are charged with wrong-doing. This is particularly true in New York City, where aggressive policing helped make the city livable again after the wave of violent crime in the 1970s and 1980s.

John Podhoretz notes, however, that part of this turnaround came from “broken windows” policing which emphasized restoring order by cracking down even on minor violations. But this case strikes me as a very, very minor non-crime, and even Podhoretz concludes that in this new, low-crime era the police need to ratchet back their response to such minor violations.

We should remember that whenever the police use force, there is the danger that they will kill someone, whether through malice, poor judgment, poor training, or sheer accident. From time to time, they’re going to shoot the wrong person or wrestle a guy to the ground without knowing that he has serious health problems and can’t survive this kind of rough handling. That is one good reason (among many) to make sure that police are only authorized to interfere with someone whose actions are a threat to the lives and property of others, and not just to enforce some dumb, petty regulation.

The contradiction of the left is that they want to inject government into every little aspect of our lives and mandate that the police confront us all the time over everything—and then they scream when some of those confrontations go wrong. In this way, they are not only hoping for a new series of contentious, racially charged killings. By extending the reach of government and the omnipresence of police power in our lives, they are creating the conditions that make those cases inevitable.

Eric Garner’s Widow Is Right To Reject The Race Card,"Stephen Colbert parodied conservative calls for colorblind government policies by claiming, “I don’t see race.” He took that statement to its unintended and ridiculous conclusion for laughs. Colbert had a friend named Alan whom he only knew to be black based on the say-so of others. At one point, he quarreled with Alan and went on a national search for a “new black friend.” Sorting through candidates was hard because the clueless talk show host literally couldn’t tell ebony from ivory.

However, there is a really important distinction between not seeing race at all and in seeing only race to the exclusion of more important things. When I first saw the video of Eric Garner being harassed by police on the streets of Staten Island’s Tomkinsville neighborhood, and being violently subdued in a way that led to his death, I did not see the former horticulturalist as a black man.

Yes, I could tell that Garner was black. My eyes work fine and video was clear enough. And Ramsey Orta, the man who filmed the lethal arrest and who now faces his own legal problems (possibly as police payback), made sure to remind us of Garner’s skin pigmentation with his running commentary. But race seemed so far beside the point to me, and to so many others, as to make it a non-issue. It was a great and unwanted distraction from the real horror at hand.

Race seemed out of place because we saw police harassing not a black man but a fellow American. If you haven’t watched the video yet, please do so. You’ll see the New York Police Department badgering a man past the point that most of us would break, reportedly after he had stopped a fight. You’ll see them tackle Garner to the ground, choke him, and refused to take much interest in the man as he lays unconscious and dying—other than to shoo passers-by away, of course. No good deed goes unpunished—or, these days, unchokeholded.

Eric Garner’s Wife Sees Police Brutality, Not Racism

You know who else shared in the colorblind reaction to Garner’s death and Officer Daniel Pantaleo’s non-indictment on manslaughter charges? Garner’s own wife. “I don’t even feel like it’s a black and white thing, honestly,” Esaw Garner said in her bracingly honest “Meet the Press” appearance this Sunday.

Esaw Garner says her husband was killed not because of the color of his skin but because law enforcement decided he was nothing more than an irritant.

Garner’s widow wants justice for the specific crime committed against her husband and for her and her family to be free from recriminations. She has refused (“hell no!”) to accept Pantaleo’s condolences and said on “Meet the Press” that her husband “was murdered” and that she still hopes the case will find its way into a courtroom. She says he was killed not because of the color of his skin but because law enforcement decided he was nothing more than an irritant. They thus assigned his life about as much value as you would assign that mosquito that lands on your arm.

There was no flattery in her words for her late husband and no obviously false notes that I could hear. At one point, speaking of Eric’s troubles with finding work, Esaw said, “He tried working with the parks department. But he had asthma, you know. He had issues, you know. Heavy guy and he was very lazy. He didn’t like to do anything. He wasn’t used to it.” Again, with that filterless honesty: “I’m not going to say that he was a career criminal but he had a past of being arrested.”

Esaw Garner leveraged her frankness to argue the police had specifically targeted her family for petty offenses, because her husband occasionally sold “loose” untaxed cigarettes to generate some cash. “They harassed us. They said things to us. We go shopping. ‘Hi, cigarette man. Hey cigarette man wife.’ You know? Stuff like that. And I would just say, ‘Eric, keep walking. Don’t say nothing. Don’t respond. Don’t give them a reason to do anything to you,’” she said. She insisted that “he never, not once, ever resisted arrest.” The closest that he got was in the video when he asked the cops why couldn’t they just leave him be, especially since he had no contraband to bust him for that day. They obviously didn’t like the question.

Eric Garner Needs, Not Special Pleading, But Solidarity

Some activists on the right have said that we should be willing to look at race in the Garner case. For a long list of reasons, blacks make up a disproportionate number of all kinds of law-enforcement actions: arrests, convictions, shootings by police. And Pantaleo has been the subject of racial bias lawsuits in the past. Given all that, they ask: How can you not look at race in this case?

Eric Garner’s death and the subsequent non-indictment of Officer Pantaleo happened because we have too many laws and too few fetters on those who enforce our laws.

That is far from a dumb question, yet I think Esaw Garner’s instincts are basically correct here. The bedrock problem is “not a black and white thing,” and neither is the solution. What’s needed is not special pleading but solidarity.

The widow Garner said on “Meet the Press” that she wants to feel safe from official harassment in the future. She does not believe playing the race card will help, and she seems to realize the changes needed will be enormous. Her family’s tragedy showed the world American law enforcement is out of control.

Focusing on race now could deprive the country of an historic opportunity. Eric Garner’s death and the subsequent non-indictment of Pantaleo happened because we have too many laws and too few fetters on those who enforce our laws. If reformers prove up to the Herculean tasks of paring back our laws and of policing the police, it would be a victory for blacks, certainly, and also for most Americans.

Here’s How An ‘America In Retreat’ Could Benefit The World,"The sequential failures of the Obama and George W. Bush administrations in managing U.S. foreign policy have led many—on the Left and the Right—to write about alternatives that avoid whatever the authors find most disturbing in each approach. Many of these commentators especially fear the policy consequences of public war-weariness, which has extended well beyond the anti-war Left to include libertarians and many fiscal conservatives, and seek to persuade frustrated Americans that foreign policy still matters. Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens’ new book “America in Retreat: The New Isolationism and the Coming Global Disorder” falls squarely into this category.

A deputy editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal who has spent most of his career with the paper, aside from a nearly three-year interlude as editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post, Stephens alternates between storytelling and analysis, with short narrative sections setting the stage for each substantive chapter. After a brief introduction explaining his purpose in writing the book, and why he believes America is in retreat, he presents a quick assessment of post-World War II U.S. foreign policy before devoting most of the book to the era after September 11 and his analysis. “America in Retreat” ends with a scenario for the collapse of the global order and Stephens’ prescription to avoid it: Washington as the world’s policeman.

Stephens is at his best in examining America’s excessively ambitious post-Cold War foreign policy. He aptly describes U.S. foreign policy in the Clinton administration as a “combination of naïveté, blind faith, and moral self-regard.” In another important passage, he criticizes George W. Bush’s decision to pursue an “open-ended, long-term, costly, and uncertain goal of bringing democracy to the Muslim world,” artfully adding that “Bush would not be satisfied merely with making examples of global outlaws like Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. Instead, he was determined to make Iraq and Afghanistan exemplary.” [Italics in original.]

Stephens’ analysis of the Obama administration’s foreign policy is less creative and generally reflects prevailing Republican attacks on “a policy of attempting to remain aloof from the travails of other countries” and Obama’s disinterest in promoting democracy. Still, he is perceptive in highlighting Obama’s excessive reliance on international law (formal rules that a divided United Nations Security Council can’t enforce) as opposed to norms (informal standards that Washington can try to establish and uphold). Stephens is also correct to point out the dangers in believing that rising U.S. energy production will relieve Americans of the need to pay attention to the Middle East.

Despite some strengths, however, the book is fundamentally a superficial one. Stephens is a good storyteller but lacks analytical depth. As a result, he is ultimately unable to establish a coherent intellectual framework for U.S. foreign policy.

The ‘Broken Window’ Theory Doesn’t Apply Internationally

The book’s central analytical weakness is its over-reliance on policing as a model for U.S. foreign policy. In essence, Stephens argues that the “broken window” theory of social order also applies at the international level—i.e., that the appearance of disorder encourages further bad behavior—and that as a result, the United States must be a global beat cop, policing modest crimes to deter more substantial ones.

Ironically, even as he takes Obama to task for his naïve reliance on international law, Stephens rather casually grants the United States an international mandate to police the world without evaluating how anyone else would react.

The problem with this approach is that while one might complain about how the police department does its job, something that is in fact a major point of debate in the United States today, police departments are legally-constituted government bodies whose authority to conduct investigations, make arrests, and even use deadly force is widely accepted within designated geographic limits. In democracies, police departments depend upon the consent of the governed. (Even in autocracies, publics generally consent to police crime-fighting as distinct from police repression.) There is no such consent at the international level, where the only body with remotely similar authorities is the United Nations Security Council. However, the Security Council relies upon member states for enforcement and cannot provide legal authority or (more importantly) political legitimacy without agreement among its five veto-wielding permanent members. (Conservatives should view this restriction very favorably, as it limits U.N. encroachment on American sovereignty.)

Ironically, even as he takes Obama to task for his naïve reliance on international law, Stephens rather casually grants the United States an international mandate to police the world without evaluating how anyone else (even certain U.S. allies) would react. Without acceptance of Stephens’ Pax Americana among the world’s leading powers, however, a certain number of key nations might welcome American policing but others will resent it or even resist it. Some will think that the police should not also serve as a self-appointed judge, jury, and executioner, others will have a different view of who is guilty and needs policing, and a few might even prefer streets empty of police to pursue their own crimes. Still others will be concerned that overly aggressive policing could harm the innocent. This is not simply a problem of Beijing, Moscow, or other authoritarian governments; recall German and French opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Absent major-power consensus supporting U.S. policing and the rules to be enforced, the “broken window” framework has very little utility in explaining the international system or formulating policy options.

International Policing Can Provoke Aggression

Although Stephens correctly distinguishes between “subsytemic” and “suprasystemic” disorder (disorder within the system and disorder that threatens the system), his attachment to the America-as-police model leads him to focus overwhelmingly on the risk that accumulating subsystemic disorder will produce suprasystemic disorder—that is, that the broken windows in Syria will lead to regional or global versions of theft, murder, and eventually international chaos. Thus he fails to recognize that attempting to combat suprasystemic disorder by imposing U.S. preferences on other major powers, especially China and Russia, could actually create suprasystemic disorder rather than containing it if such efforts drive Beijing and Moscow to cooperate against U.S. policing. This would not require a long-lasting or wide-ranging China-Russia alliance to be very costly; the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact (which arose for different reasons) was quite brief in historical terms but quite damaging in its consequences.

Moreover, suprasystemic disorder is more likely to contribute to subsystemic disorder than the reverse. Imagine Syria’s civil war as a full-blown proxy war between major powers in conflict (the natural result of suprasystemic disorder). Or, for that matter, Ukraine’s. From this perspective, anyone seeking to maintain international order would do better to focus on stable relationships among the world’s major powers than on each individual conflict in a world of over 7 billion people divided into nearly 200 countries and uncountable ethnic and religious groups.

‘America in Retreat’ Forces America into a Mental Model

In addition to these underlying problems, “America in Retreat” has many minor weaknesses. Some, like Stephens’ description of Vladimir Lukin—a founder and former leader of Russia’s pro-reform Yabloko party who became Russia’s human rights ombudsman—as a “Kremlin apparatchik”—likely reflect inadequate research. Others, such as his face-value acceptance of ominous-sounding statements by various Chinese, Russian, or Iranian leaders without any effort to assess their motives, seem to originate in an intellectual inconsistency that accepts that American leaders say things they don’t really mean for political reasons but expects foreign leaders to eschew similar behavior. Still others—such as his statement amidst a litany of dark projections for Europe’s future that its Muslim population will “easily double” by 2020 without explaining why he thinks this would be a problem—seem to express underlying attitudes and unexamined assumptions. (This impression is reinforced by the fact that Stephens enthuses about U.S. population growth and an American population that will remain younger than other leading nations but does not express parallel alarm at the demographic changes in the United States enabling this.)

The principal problem with the Obama administration’s foreign policy is not that it rests on a strategy of ‘retreat’ or of ‘nation-building at home,’ as Stephens argues, but that it is not strategic at all.

Ultimately, however, Stephens fails in his central task not due to these minor flaws but as a result of his forced effort to make the real world fit his mental model. This goes well beyond his curious fixation with the broken windows theory; it also defines his treatment of President Obama and Sen. Rand Paul, who appear to be his principal targets, and his assessment of foreign policy realism—a far more promising alternative to Bush and Obama than Stephens’ policing strategy.

The principal problem with the Obama administration’s foreign policy is not that it rests on a strategy of “retreat” or of “nation-building at home,” as Stephens argues, but that it is not strategic at all. Seriously pursuing “retreat” and “nation-building at home” would in fact require much greater effort to manage the international environment in a way that would allow the United States could concentrate on its own affairs—something that the president has little apparent interest in attempting. For Obama, “nation-building at home” is more a slogan than a strategy. It provides rhetorical justification for a disinterested and politically-driven foreign policy, allowing the White House to check the box and move on.

Stephens’ attitude toward Paul is perhaps most obvious in his 2019 “scenario for global disorder,” which occurs three years after Hillary Clinton’s 2016 “blowout victory” over Paul to become president. Although he is careful to describe Paul as a “political work in progress” and accepts that Paul’s views may differ from those of his father, Ron Paul, Stephens quickly follows this with the statement that “there is a Republican precedent for a foreign policy that in many ways resembles Paul’s” from the isolationist 1920s and 1930s—without actually presenting Paul’s statements or positions for comparison. Finally, although Paul describes himself as a foreign policy realist, Stephens argues that this cannot be, because “[Hans] Morgenthau’s Realism would not automatically forbid” drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American territory that Paul rejects. Since the purpose of realist theory is to explain relations between states rather than domestic governance, this is hardly surprising.

Who’s the Real Unrealist?

As the reference to Morgenthau illustrates, Stephens thoroughly confuses realism as an academic international relations theory with realism as a practical guide to U.S. foreign policy. The two are very different, most notably because practical foreign policy realists give considerable emphasis to domestic political processes that are secondary in realist theory. Thus Stephens tries to knock down realism by taking on its extremes rather than honestly assessing its more practical form. “Realism, in its purest sense, has become politically unrealistic,” he writes. Perhaps in its purest sense this is true—but every other approach is likewise politically unrealistic in its purest sense; the world is too complicated for ideal types. More significantly, the military budget that Stephens seeks, 5 percent of America’s gross domestic product, is also politically unrealistic—a fatal blow to his foreign policy vision.

As realists know, however, world order first requires ordered relationships among the major powers that Pax Americana precludes.

What Stephens and other interventionist foreign policy commentators are loathe to acknowledge is the extent to which they themselves are responsible for public rejection of not only military action but even U.S. international leadership. For nearly two decades, interventionists on both the Right and the Left have insisted over and over again that America leads when it uses force and abandons leadership when it doesn’t. Because most Americans believed in U.S. leadership, this argument was successful in Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq, Libya, and many smaller conflicts. (Afghanistan is a special case, since the U.S. invasion directly followed the September 11 attacks.) However, once many became frustrated with near-constant war, they also began to question U.S. leadership; if this is what leading means, they thought to themselves, I don’t want it.

Realism solves this problem by providing a new definition of American leadership that rests upon U.S. military power—and the use of force when vital national interests are at stake or the survival of U.S. allies is threatened—but does not depend upon frequent, much less routine, military action to police conflicts. It does not mean abandoning the rest of the world; on the contrary, one of the most important reasons for the United States to preserve and strengthen the existing international order is that Americans are among its principal beneficiaries economically, socially, politically, and in security—something realists well recognize. As realists know, however, world order first requires ordered relationships among the major powers that Pax Americana precludes. Realism’s enlightened self-interest, incorporating efforts to help others when we can make a real difference at an acceptable cost, is much better than unending armed policing to avoid the retreat and disorder that Bret Stephens fears.

Even Small Towns Are Loading Up On Grenade Launchers,"Custer is a nice little town in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Not quite the tourist center of the area—that’s really more up toward Keystone and Mount Rushmore—it still get its share of summer visitors’ traffic. Enough, anyway, to support just over 2,000 people, out of a county population somewhere around 8,500. Rick Wheeler, the sheriff of Custer County, presides over a department that has received at least $141,005.63 in military equipment from the federal government since 1991—including two suits of armor, a “gunner protection kit,” and eight 7.62 mm rifles.

Or so, at least, the Marshall Project reports, assembling recently released data from the Pentagon’s “1033 Program,” which distributes surplus military equipment to local law enforcement. Reached by phone, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office insisted the figure was false—but he agreed that Custer had received each item on the Pentagon’s list, so the disagreement seems to be only over the valuation.

It’s not that much equipment, of course, and it’s not worth that much money. Not, anyway, when the 1033 Program as a whole has distributed over $5 billion in equipment since 1990. Not when—to take a few examples chronicled by the Marshall Report—the 67 police officers of Johnston, Rhode Island, (population 29,000) got ten tactical trucks and 35 assault rifles. Or the security guards of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences signed up for eight rifles and four shotguns, and the campus police at Florida International received 50 M-16 rifles and a mine-resistant vehicle (MRAP). The South Dakota state penitentiary has done better than any of the state’s counties, but even that haul is merely $489,964 worth of military equipment, a trifle compared to the worst offenders around the country.

Why Do Civilian Agencies Need Military Gear?

Yet consider this: Yes, for example, the office of South Dakota’s attorney general got only the bagatelle of five rifles worth $2,495, but why aren’t we asking the prior question: What exactly is a Midwestern state’s attorney general doing with any military rifles?

Are things so bad along the banks of the Missouri River that the town of Yankton (population 14,500) really needs a robot, a grenade launcher, 14 reflex sights, and a pair of riot guns?

What, for that matter, is anyone doing with military equipment? Only once news images showed the equipment trotted out by law enforcement in Ferguson, Missouri, did the larger public begin to notice the phenomenon against which conservative and libertarian writers had been inveighing for some time, particularly Radley Balko, in his 2013 book Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces. Now, of course, President Obama has promised an inquiry into the program.

But those relatively minor Pentagon details involving South Dakota (which received only a few military assault vehicles and suits of armor, which I looked up solely because it’s my own small-population state) point to a deep constitutional offense hidden in the 1033 surplus equipment—and point toward that offense even more clearly than the arming of police in big cities. Are things so bad along the banks of the Missouri River that the town of Yankton (population 14,500) really needs a robot, a grenade launcher, 14 reflex sights, and a pair of riot guns from the U.S. military? The sheriff of the surrounding county, Jim Vlahakis, apparently thought his office could get by with only a pair of rifles from the military program. So why did Brian Paulsen, Yankton’s chief of police, think his police force needed all this? (The run-around and refusal to return phone calls that most of the South Dakota law-enforcement agencies gave me is revealing; only the desk officer in Custer spoke to me originally, and mostly, I think, because my question took him by surprise.)

When Law Enforcement Becomes War

The police departments of the two largest cities in the state, Sioux Falls and Rapid City, and the sheriffs in their surrounding counties, Minnehaha and Pennington, are listed in the Pentagon’s documents as receiving only a few rifles. But the town of Mitchell (population 15,500) is listed with $733,000 worth of equipment. The sheriff of Codington County (population 27,500) with $415,400. And when we reach the South Dakota Highway Patrol, headed by Colonel Craig Price, things get wildly out of hand: $2.7 million worth of full-tracked carriers, armored trucks, grenade launchers, and other equipment. Robots, riot guns, night sights, a military helicopter: the Highway Patrol has you covered if war breaks out in the Bad Lands and the Black Hills.

Robots, riot guns, night sights, a military helicopter: the Highway Patrol has you covered if war breaks out in the Bad Lands and the Black Hills.

Short of war, however, the offense of all this equipment is something we might expect small-town and small-state law-enforcement officers to understand. Big cities, with their special-uniformed SWAT teams and army-style ranks, are deeply infected with the militarization of America’s police. But in a place like Custer, South Dakota—or Yankton, and Codington County, and the Highway Patrol’s office in Pierre—the older understandings of posse comitatus and the separation of the army from civil life ought still to be in the air.

Police officers have the right and the duty to protect themselves, but a disturbing message is sent by every piece of military equipment in the hands of civilian authorities. Each tank and military helicopter says we cannot police ourselves. Each grenade launcher proclaims that, even in a small town, law-enforcement is just a species of war.

Winning The Murdered NYPD Officers Blame Game Won’t Bring Peace,"On Saturday, two NYPD officers were shot and killed as they sat in their marked police car on a street corner. Investigators say that Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed by a gunman named Ismaaiyl Brinsley. They report that he wanted to avenge the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, who died at the hands of police in recent months. Brinsley killed himself after the murders. Earlier in the day he had reportedly shot an ex-girlfriend in Maryland.

Protests across the country have erupted in response to the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and the lack of indictments for the police involved in their deaths. While many protests have been completely peaceful, some included looting and riots and chants calling for dead cops. More recent protests have come under the umbrella of #BlackLivesMatter, as Garner, Brown and other men killed in high-profile shootings were black.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s comments after the Garner decision, which discussed how he has trained his bi-racial son to be careful in any interaction with a police officer, angered many cops. They said he’s been insufficiently supportive of the difficulties they face. After the murders of Liu and Ramos, NYPD officers turned their backs on de Blasio when he arrived for a press conference.

And as tense as relations are in New York, social media erupted with some supporters of police trying to pin blame for the murders on anti-cop rhetoric emanating from critics of police overreach. This in turn led to responses from others that this was no better than when major media elites blamed Sarah Palin for the shooting of Gabby Giffords in a mass shooting in Arizona a few years ago.

That’s a horrible comparison.

Here’s a sample tweet response to claims that anti-cop rhetoric contributed to the officers’ deaths:

Those blaming deBlasio for NYPD killings were outraged when Palin/tea party were blamed for Giffords' shooting They were right then

Over at Reason, Nick Gillespie wrote:

Just as Sarah Palin’s defense of gun rights has zero culpability in the shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords and Dallas’s right-wing “climate of hate” had nothing to do with Marxist-Leninist Lee Harvey Oswald’s assassinaton of JFK, it’s worth underscoring at every moment of what is already shaping up as a very ugly debate that the actual killer is the culprit here.

We should blame the individuals who commit violent acts for the violence, but these are really bad comparisons. The New York Times and other prominent media blamed Sarah Palin for the shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords and Dallas’ “climate of hate” for the assassination of JFK. But there has been no evidence whatsoever in any way shape or form that Palin’s existence, much less defense of gun rights or electoral “targeting” of Giffords’ district, were even known to Giffords’ shooter, Jared Lee Loughner. And as much as I love a good conspiracy theory, there is no evidence that Marxist-Leninist Lee Harvey Oswald was in any way moved by any “climate of hate,” much less anything even remotely conservative.

Here’s why the Palin comparison fails.

Let’s not forget exactly what went down in the smearing of Palin four years ago. A PAC associated with Palin had put out a map with races to “target” and had identified those “targets” with crosshairs. This could not be more common for political campaigns. Indeed, progressive groups had put out similar maps with bulls-eyes for races they wanted to focus on. Some activists began blaming Palin for the shooting and the media responded by running wall-to-wall coverage of the map and pieces headlined “Did Sarah Palin’s Target Map Play Role in Giffords Shooting?.”

The Atlantic’s James Fallows wondered “whether there is a connection between” such “extreme, implicitly violent political rhetoric and imagery” as that published by Palin and “actual outbursts of violence, whatever the motivations of this killer turn out to be.” Was Palin’s map the equivalent, then, of “falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic?”

The Washington Post wrote a story headlined “Palin caught in crosshairs map controversy after Tucson shootings.”

Andrew Sullivan wrote, “No one is saying Sarah Palin should be viewed as an accomplice to murder. Many are merely saying that her recklessly violent and inflammatory rhetoric has poisoned the discourse and has long run the risk of empowering the deranged. We are saying it’s about time someone took responsibility for this kind of rhetorical extremism, because it can and has led to violence and murder.”

The New York Times’ Matt Bai wrote, “it’s hard not to think [Loughner] was at least partly influenced by a debate that often seems to conflate philosophical disagreement with some kind of political Armageddon.”

In “Imagery of Armed Revolution,” the New York Times’ Matt Bai wrote, “it’s hard not to think [Loughner] was at least partly influenced by a debate that often seems to conflate philosophical disagreement with some kind of political Armageddon.” He added, “The problem would seem to rest with the political leaders who pander to the margins of the margins, employing whatever words seem likely to win them contributions or TV time, with little regard for the consequences.” He said Palin and other used “imagery of armed revolution. Popular spokespeople like Ms. Palin routinely drop words like ‘tyranny’ and ‘socialism’ when describing the president and his allies, as if blind to the idea that Americans legitimately faced with either enemy would almost certainly take up arms.”

And at Psychology Today, neurologist David Weisman wrote that “The question is not ‘did Sarah Palin’s violent rhetoric cause this shooting?’ The question is ‘does inciting violence factor in a multi-factorial process?'” He concluded, “[a]lthough there is little clear evidence in this case, the data highlights the importance of butterfly events on human actions. Jared Loughner is clearly deranged. He drank deeply from internal insanity and external stimuli. His actions did not take place in a vacuum.”

You might also recall that when Palin attempted to defend herself from all major media blaming her for a horrific massacre in Arizona, we then saw a new round of angry media claiming she’d tried to dog-whistle evangelicals or something because she’d used the phrase ‘blood libel.’

The slur wasn’t just aimed at Palin but the entire Tea Party. As John Sexton pointed out on Twitter, Slate’s Jacob Weisberg had a good example of the form in his piece “How anti-government, pro-gun, xenophobic populism made the Giffords shooting more likely.”:

It is appropriate, however, to consider what was swirling outside Loughner's head. To call his crime an attempted assassination is to acknowledge that it appears to have had a political and not merely a personal context. That context wasn't Islamic radicalism, Puerto Rican independence, or anarcho-syndicalism. It was the anti-government, pro-gun, xenophobic populism that flourishes in the dry and angry climate of Arizona. Extremist shouters didn't program Loughner, in some mechanistic way, to shoot Gabrielle Giffords. But the Tea Party movement did make it appreciably more likely that a disturbed person like Loughner would react, would be able to react, and would not be prevented from reacting, in the crazy way he did.

However, in the case of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, we have reason to believe that he was at least claiming a motive of revenge for the deaths of Garner and Brown.

However, in the case of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, we have reason to believe that he was at least claiming a motive of revenge for the deaths of Garner and Brown. He allegedly put up an Instagram picture of a gun with a caption that said, “I’m putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours … let’s take 2 of theirs.” He added hashtags for ShootThePolice, RIPErivGarner (sic) and RIPMikeBrown. A later post said he was “putting pigs in a blanket.”

If Weisberg could blame the Tea Party for the swirls of imaginary conditions, I have no doubt that he is working right now on his piece even more vociferously condemning #BlackLivesMatter for the shooting of NYPD officers.

Now, maybe we’ll learn that what we’ve been told about Brinsley was an elaborate ruse or that the information only seemed to come from Brinsley, but it is obvious that blaming anti-cop rhetoric is a completely different situation than blaming Palin and the Tea Party for deaths they had literally zero relationship to. It may still be wrong to blame anti-cop rhetoric but we already know from what we’ve seen thus far, that reporters have not similarly rushed to run anguished pieces blaming Eric Holder or de Blasio or other politicians.

Individual vs. collective guilt

Again, Nick Gillespie’s argument that people who kill other people should be held completely accountable for those killings is correct. The problem we have in the current discussion of #BlackLivesMatter is that some of the discussion has been about collective guilt.

What began as a potentially constructive conversation about the militarization of police forces; failures maintaining community policing standards; and how those problems affect certain communities disproportionately has unfortunately become mostly a droning monologue of political correctness and groupthink.

One of the regrettable things about the recent call for a less militarized and better community policing is that it seems to have been if not taken over then at least dramatically influenced by that sort of professional protesting contingent of socialists and communists. What began as a potentially constructive conversation about the militarization of police forces; failures maintaining community policing standards; and how those problems affect certain communities disproportionately has unfortunately become mostly a droning monologue of political correctness and groupthink.

Over at SocialistWorker.org, a recent write-up of protests included some interesting chants. I should note that I’m not even sure these reports are true. One of the protest write-ups claims that drivers who were blockaded by protesters gave thumbs-up signs and other shows of support. That sounds implausible until you remember you’re reading the Boulder, Colorado, update. It really might be true.

Anyway, in Boston, we’re told, protesters chanted “Eric Garner, Mike Brown, shut this racist system down,” and “Same story every time, being black is not a crime!” In Minneapolis they chanted “The whole damn system is guilty as hell.”

We’ve seen Smith College president apologize for saying “all lives matter” instead of “black lives matter.” And Huffington Post gives regular updates about what white people can and can’t do if they want to protest police overreach.

All this speaks to the way this discussion has moved from the individual responsibility of the officers in question to notions of collective and systemic guilt. And the response to the killing of these NYPD officers might show how difficult it is to turn that instinct on and off. It might also show why free societies tend to hold individuals responsible instead of groups. In fact, it’s striking how much of our problems achieving peace in these discussions stem from the way we fail to see people as individuals with dignity, be they black or white, cop or civilian. Every group, of course, has some bad actors. But we should be on guard against developing bigoted responses that apply to groups instead of individuals.

To go back to the Giffords example from 2011, CNN’s headline at the time was “Shooting throws spotlight on state of U.S. political rhetoric.” The Telegraph’s was “Gabrielle Giffords shooting: inflammatory rhetoric draws real blood.” When do we blame individuals for shootings and when do we blame groups? Should that change based on the politics of the situation?

The larger progressive political climate will really need to grapple with this. If, as they say, “microagressions” contribute to “rape culture,” how has the rhetoric surrounding Ferguson protests contributed to the murder of cops?

Consistency is key for everyone.

We’ve already seen that the comparison between blaming Palin for Gabby Giffords’ shooting is inappropriate. And while Palin’s map had the media in a tizzy for weeks, they never blamed (or even covered, really) the Southern Poverty Law Center, much less any broader movement, for putting out a “hate map” that led one activist to shoot up Family Research Council. So that’s not a comparison we can make either.

Yes, the media and those activists who hold double standards should be held to account. But there is very little to gain by actually falling down the rabbit hole of reflexive movement blaming with them.

But it is true that we’ve routinely seen the pro-life movement blamed for the violence perpetrated by solo activists against abortion clinics and those that end unborn lives via abortion. And the members of the pro-life civil rights movement can assure you how frustrating and unfair that is.

Conservatives are probably always going to be blamed by the New York Times for any and all ills, no matter how far-fetched the claim will be. But those who believe in individual responsibility can’t pick and choose when to believe in it. These cops were killed by one man, acting alone. We will likely learn more in the days to come about his political inclinations, his mental state, and his response to political rhetoric. If there is one thing that fair-minded people have learned from the media’s rush to blame conservatives for any and all violence, it’s that the actual story usually ranges from complete fabrication to very complicated tale.

Yes, the media and those activists who hold double standards should be held to account. But there is very little to gain by actually falling down the rabbit hole of reflexive movement blaming with them.

As we close out 2014, as another sad day of violence ends, could we also try to see the best in each other’s arguments? Let’s put the best construction on what others are trying to say and see if we can get slightly closer to living in peace with one another.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/12/22/winning-the-murdered-nypd-officers-blame-game-wont-bring-peace/,2014-12-22
The NYPD’s Revolt Is A Direct Threat To Democracy,"Since the moment when police officers turned their backs in protest on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, we’ve seen the type of escalating activity in the city which would be more recognizable as the preview to a messy Latin American coup d’etat. The latest is a form of purposeful sabotage on the part of the NYPD, which is now actively shirking its duty to enforce the law. According to the New York Post, traffic tickets and summonses have plummeted by 94 percent, and overall arrests are down 66 percent for the week compared to the same period last year. Here’s the data comparisons from this year to 2013:

Citations for traffic violations fell by 94 percent, from 10,069 to 587, during that time frame. Summonses for low-level offenses like public drinking and urination also plunged 94 percent — from 4,831 to 300. Even parking violations are way down, dropping by 92 percent, from 14,699 to 1,241. Drug arrests by cops assigned to the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau — which are part of the overall number — dropped by 84 percent, from 382 to 63.

Considering how much New York, as with many of our other major cities, has leaned toward over-policing, this isn’t all a bad thing – I’m not going to get worked up about cops handing out fewer parking violations. But as a whole, this represents a completely irresponsible rejection of the duty to enforce the law. Yesterday, speaking to a graduating class of more than 800 new officers at Madison Square Garden, de Blasio was booed and heckled as he struggled to extend an oratorical olive branch. De Blasio told the gathering of new cops “you will confront all the problems that plague our society, problems that you didn’t create” – in response, a heckler jeered “You created them!” People in the audience applauded and cheered as a de Blasio tried to recover with even more voluminous praise for the force.

Supporters of the NYPD have pointed out throughout the back-turning that their officers feel upset at Mayor de Blasio and others, that they feel they are less safe because of the comments of politicians. This is one more example of one of the most irritating tendencies of unionized police forces today – a recurring demand that they receive the same attitude of respect for authority given to the United States military, without any of the responsibility and duty that comes with it. A poll last week found that a mere 15 percent of active duty service members approve of President Obama – understandable, considering his many policy decisions and a laundry list of questionable choices.

But is the American military turning their backs on the Commander in Chief? Showing contempt for him? Going AWOL with the endorsement of their superiors? Shirking their duty? Booing and jeering at him at a graduation ceremony? No. They, after all, are not unionized.

The real rise of frustration with police officers in America comes down to one thing: an enduring sense that the current law enforcement system is unfair. We have to abide by rules they do not. We are the civilians, as if they are not. When we go before a court, enduring bias assumes that police are responsible and honest, even if the evidence suggests otherwise. District attorneys have one method for grand juries with cops, and different methods for ones without cops. The problem is one of institutional disrespect for their own civic obligations. We have to obey the commands of officers, but they have no real desire to obey the commands of their own authorities, or the ultimate authority they serve – the people.

In retrospect, Mayor de Blasio should’ve responded to the backs turning by firing people immediately. The NYPD needed to be reminded that chain of command exists, and that they are not at the top of it. Instead, what New York City is experiencing now amounts to nothing less than open rebellion by the lone armed force under the worst kind of weakened junta, one led by a figure ideologically radical and personally weak, who has lost control of his bureaucracies and may soon be devoured by them.

Perhaps he can take a cue from a political leader of another time, who faced open revolt from a police force in another major city.

To Mr. Samuel Gompers President American Federation of Labor New York City, N.Y. Replying to your telegram, I have already refused to remove the Police Commissioner of Boston. I did not appoint him. He can assume no position which the courts would uphold except what the people have by the authority of their law vested in him. He speaks only with their voice. The right of the police of Boston to affiliate has always been questioned, never granted, is now prohibited. The suggestion of President Wilson to Washington does not apply to Boston. There the police have remained on duty. Here the Policemen's Union left their duty, an action which President Wilson characterized as a crime against civilization. Your assertion that the Commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of leaving the city unguarded. That furnished the opportunity, the criminal element furnished the action. There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time. You ask that the public safety again be placed in the hands of these same policemen while they continue in disobedience to the laws of Massachusetts and in their refusal to obey the orders of the Police Department. Nineteen men have been tried and removed. Others having abandoned their duty, their places have, under the law, been declared vacant on the opinion of the Attorney General. I can suggest no authority outside the courts to take further action. I wish to join and assist in taking a broad view of every situation. A grave responsibility rests on all of us. You can depend on me to support you in every legal action and sound policy. I am equally determined to defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts and to maintain the authority and jurisdiction over her public officers where it has been placed by the Constitution and law of her people.

The Police No Longer Work For You,"To the casual observer it appears that Virginia is run by violent psychopaths. That’s the takeaway from the recent report of an anti-poker SWAT team raid in Fairfax County, in which eight assault rifle-sporting police officers moved against ten card-playing civilians. The police possibly seized more than $200,000 from the game, of which 40 percent they eventually kept.

There was no indication that any of the players was armed. As a matter of fact, it appears that a gambler is more likely to be shot without provocation by the Fairfax Police than the other way around. The heavy firepower at the Fairfax raid was apparently motivated by the fact that “at times, illegal weapons are present” at such poker games, and that “Asian gangs” have allegedly targeted such events in the past. This is, then, a novel approach to law enforcement: as a matter of policy, Fairfax police now attempt to rob and steal from people before street gangs get around to doing it.

It is a mystery why we put up with this obscene police behavior. Gambling itself is not illegal in Virginia; it is simply controlled by the state. So the Fairfax police department did not bust these hapless poker players with guns drawn for doing something truly immoral and fully outlawed, merely for doing something in a way not approved by the state legislature. Were gambling actually forbidden in Virginia, then a crackdown could at least be understood, if not condoned in so paramilitary a fashion. Yet Virginia’s stance on the matter is not to treat gambling as malum in se, but rather as an instrumentum regni: our government prefers to funnel gambling money into its own coffers for its own ends, outlaw the same thing when it’s done outside of the state’s jurisdiction, and then steal the money of the poor fellows who happen to get caught.

Local Police Are Not Supposed to Be Thugs

This is, in other words, a matter of state-sanctioned greed and opportunism. Gambling is an immensely profitable business. Like alcohol, a portion of which industry the government in Virginia also controls with a similar level of violence and incompetence, gambling is enough of a cash cow that the Commonwealth is reluctant to let anyone else handle it. This is not because state-controlled lotteries are any more virtuous or less risky. Indeed, Virginia officials know gambling can be both addicting and destructive, which is why the state prints gambling self-help phone numbers on all of its tickets.

Governments control gambling not to legitimize and sanitize the practice, but to extract as much money from the citizenry as they possibly can. In the state’s eyes, the fault of the poker players in Fairfax lay not in betting money on a card game, but in not pouring money into the state’s bank account while they were doing so.

More than anything, events like these are a helpful reminder as to why many of us support smaller and explicitly limited government. Given the choice between more freedoms and liberties, or empowering a bunch of armor-clad incompetent murderers, it is a wonder anyone would ever pick the latter. A free people does not deserve to be governed by thugs and gun-toting lunatics. The Fairfax police department should be ashamed of itself—and the citizens of Fairfax, and of Virginia generally, should move quickly to change the sad state of affairs in which a harmless card game is met with a militarized police response.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/03/the-police-no-longer-work-for-you/,2015-02-03
Loretta Lynch Is Eric Holder 2.0—And The Senate Should Block Her,"If President Obama’s nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch, gets appointed, she will continue the practice of her predecessor by expanding presidential power and the federal government, ultimately threatening the liberty of American citizens and the stability of the nation. It is the Senate’s constitutional duty to make sure that doesn’t happen.

Lynch supports Obama’s unconstitutional amnesty, believes illegal immigrants should have the same rights to employment as American citizens, opposes voter ID laws, advocates federal intrusion in local law enforcement under the guise of civil rights, supports the government taking private property on flimsy grounds, and offers no opposition to using drones against American citizens.

It’s a Problem When the Top Law Enforcer Won’t Enforce Laws

Sen. Jeff Sessions says he opposes Lynch’s nomination because she supports Obama’s executive amnesty, which he says is “one of the most breathtaking exertions of executive power in the history of this country.”

“After Congress rejected the president’s favored immigration legislation,” Sessions said, “the White House met with the interest groups who had crafted that bill and implemented the major provisions of the legislation that Congress had rejected through executive fiat.”

The Attorney General’s Office of Legal Counsel issued the legal opinion that attempted to justify this run-around Congress, prompting Sessions at the outset of the nomination process to state that no senator should vote to confirm anyone for the top law enforcement job in America who supported the president’s unlawful actions.

“Congress must defend its constitutional role, which is clearly threatened,” Sessions argued. “Unfortunately, when asked [during the hearing] whether she found the president’s actions to be legal and constitutional, Ms. Lynch said that she did.”

Sessions was also concerned by Lynch’s unambiguous statement that “the right and the obligation to work is one that’s shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone is here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they would be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace.”

Sen. David Vitter called her comments “crazy.” “The law is very clear on this fact that they do not have the right to work in the United States,” he said.

Vitter argued that Lynch is basically saying that illegal immigrants have the same right to work as citizens and green-card holders, which is not true.

Lynch also opposes voter ID laws, as does Holder, claiming that they disenfranchise minority voters.

“Fifty years after the march on Washington, 50 years after the Civil Rights Movement, we stand in this country at a time when we see people trying to take back so much of what Dr. King fought for,” Lynch said. “People try and take over the State House and reverse the goals that have been made in voting in this country.

“But I’m proud to tell you that the Department of Justice has looked at these laws, and looked at what’s happening in the Deep South, and in my home state of North Carolina [that] has brought lawsuits against those voting rights changes that seek to limit our ability to stand up and exercise our rights as citizens. And those lawsuits will continue.”

Loretta Lynch Supports Taking Over Local Law Enforcement

Both Obama and Holder have called voting ID laws, which require all citizens to have a photo ID to vote, racist or at least tainted by a “racial element.”

When it comes to civil rights in America, Lynch says there’s still more work to do, and she supports the work Obama and Holder have done. “[Nelson] Mandela and [Martin Luther] King knew we had to continue working, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t tell you, that under this president and under this attorney general, that the Department of Justice is committed to following through with those dreams.”

One way Holder is “following through with those dreams” and “banging the civil-rights drum” is by using faux civil-rights cases, such as those of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, to unleash Justice Department community organizers on state and local police departments. Under the department’s civil-rights scheme, more than 20 cities and their police departments are beholden to the Obama Justice Department, Andrew McCarthy writes at National Review.

In the same vein as Holder, Lynch has blamed law enforcement for racial tensions.

“Frankly, the onus is on law enforcement because we are the ones who have taken the oath to protect and to serve the people of this city,” Lynch said in 2000 as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. “And we are the ones who have the ability to change from within.”

Not everyone in law enforcement agrees with Lynch’s opinion. “Whatever has happened in America to cause these feelings of resentment, it’s not the failure of law enforcement,” said Jeff Roorda, business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association. Racial tensions are due to “decades of racial disparity and economic disparity. It’s not a problem with the police,” he added.

Lynch says people are afraid of law enforcement, and even after years of reduction in crime in New York, Lynch said she didn’t trust the numbers. “While crime is down, there is a large part of our community that still does not feel safe. And that means that law enforcement has not done its job, no matter what the numbers say.”

Lynch’s statements mimic those of Holder, who recently said he didn’t think people should have to fear the police, but there is distrust between people of color and law enforcement. “We’re not at a stage where I can honestly say, you know, truthfully say that if you’re a person of color, you should not be concerned about any interaction that you have with the police in the same way I can’t say to a police officer, you shouldn’t worry about what community you are being asked to operate in.”

To Confirm or Not to Confirm Loretta Lynch

Despite Lynch’s unwavering support of Holder’s positions and Obama’s lawlessness, Sen. Orrin Hatch inexplicably says he will support her nomination, even after admitting that the Justice Department is in “dire need of new leadership” because its decisions have been politicized for too long, and it has facilitated the president’s abuses instead of upholding the rule of law.

Sen. Rand Paul has taken the opposite view and says, “She’s going down.” He considers her unfit for the office, not only because of her views on civil rights, but because of her support of civil asset forfeiture—where the federal government takes private property without good reason—and her “non-answer” to Sen. Ted Cruz’ question about the use of drones to kill an American citizen on American soil.

“I’m concerned that a big part of her fame as a federal prosecutor was through civil forfeiture,” Paul said. “She was asked specifically about this by Sen. Lee, and her response was, ‘Oh, everything is fine, it’s done with a court order.’ She seems to not quite understand that innocent people are having their stuff taken by government–their cars, their money, their hotels, their stuff is being confiscated by government even if they’re never charged or even if they’re never convicted. She didn’t seem to grasp that point and this is a week after parts of the administration said they were not going to enforce some of the civil forfeiture.”

Paul added that her views on executive amnesty were even more troubling. “The separation of powers is probably the most important underpinning of our constitutional system. If her position is that the executive branch can write laws or amend laws, that would be a real problem with me.”

It’s also a real problem with Cruz, who has called on the Senate majority leader to halt confirmations of every nominee, executive and judicial, (except those vital to national security) until the president rescinds his unconstitutional amnesty.

Cruz said Lynch’s immigration views were “dangerous” and questioned whether Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should even have the chamber consider her nomination. McConnell has said he would, stating, “I can’t imagine any circumstance in which a president’s nominee for a Cabinet position would not be given a courtesy of a vote on the floor of the Senate.” This view is short-sighted and almost certainly guarantees that Lynch will be confirmed.

Cruz has urged his fellow Republicans to vote against Lynch. “If every Republican on the Judiciary Committee votes ‘no,’ Ms. Lynch’s confirmation will be defeated. Likewise, if Republican leadership chooses not to report the nomination to the floor, Ms. Lynch’s nomination will be defeated.

“If Republicans mean what we say when we oppose the president’s unconstitutional executive amnesty, then we should use every constitutional check and balance we have. One of the most potent checks and balances the Constitution gives the Senate is the power of confirmation.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham says not confirming Lynch is pointless because it will just leave Holder in charge. “Nobody is going to say that the executive order is illegal that President Obama appoints, so the idea that we would block an attorney general nominee until you’ve gotten somebody to agree with Sen. Cruz about the executive order is probably not feasible,” Graham said. “It ensures that Eric Holder stays in place for two years. It’s picking a fight that we can’t win.”

Senate Consent Is an Opportunity to Check Executive Power

But is rejecting Lynch simply a matter of picking a fight the Republicans can’t win? Not according to the Founders, who established the appointment clause as a check on executive power. The president has the authority to nominate, but he needs the consent of the Senate. If the Senate refuses to reject unqualified or unacceptable nominees, it will be abdicating its authority to the executive branch, further empowering a president who has already proved willing to overstep his legal boundaries.

The Senate’s active and responsible role in the appointment process is, as Alexander Hamilton said, “an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity and, in addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.”

The possibility of rejection, Hamilton said, would serve as a strong motive for the president to be circumspect and prudent in proposing a nominee.

The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body, whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit, than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.

In other words, the president should submit nominees with fear and trepidation. There should be a sense of danger involved if he nominates someone who is unfit—either for personal or ideological reasons. It is up to the Senate, which has the responsibility to restrain the president, to use all its power to expose a nominee as being unable to protect the republic. And nothing threatens the republic more than the unchecked power of a lawless president—a lawlessness Lynch supports.

It is because of dangerous and unfit nominees, such as Lynch, that the Founders designed the appointment clause the way they did. The Senate has a great deal of leeway in the process. It has the authority to refuse a nominee for any reason (the Constitution doesn’t speak to any guidelines in this matter, leaving it open, though Hamilton insisted that the reasons should be “special and strong”).

The president has the advantage in this process, to be sure. He is the one who can nominate. The Senate cannot, and it is not in a position to advise him on nominations prior to making a choice. However, it is the job—no, the absolute duty—of the Senate to stop unacceptable nominees, even if that means the president will nominate another person just like the previous one. In that case, the Senate will reject that one as well—and on it goes.

“As to offices, the Senate has no other influence but a restraint on improper appointments,” James Iredell said at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention. “The President proposes such a man for such an office. The Senate has to consider upon it. If they think him improper, the President must nominate another, whose appointment ultimately again depends upon the Senate.”

Struggle Between the Branches Helps Secure Liberty

This conflict, this gridlock, is necessary to ensure that one branch of government does not gain power over another. The result should inevitably be a major struggle when two branches are at odds—even if that means dragging the situation out for months. The hope, in that process, is that the American people will be made aware of the conflict and exert pressure on one or both branches to make better choices.

“The only real security of liberty, in any country, is the jealousy and circumspection of the people themselves,” Iredell said. “Let them be watchful over their rulers. Should they find a combination against their liberties, and all other methods appear insufficient to preserve them, they have, thank God, an ultimate remedy. That power which created the government can destroy it.”

How can people be watchers over their rulers if one of the branches rubberstamps the unacceptable or unlawful actions of another without thoroughly bringing them to the public’s attention? In the case of the Lynch nomination, Graham might be right, and Obama will continue to nominate people who support his lawlessness, but if the Senate does its job, it will expose the president to the American people; they can then exert political pressure on him to correct himself. If the people decide they want someone as attorney general, like Holder, who supports executive unconstitutional actions, then there is nothing to be done. But they should at least be given the opportunity to be aware of the issues and see there are leaders in the Senate fighting for their liberty by upholding the rule of law. That opportunity will never be had if the Senate refuses to do its job.

The appointments clause in the Constitution (Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2) says, “The President … shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law” (emphasis added).

Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania said, “As the president was to nominate, there would be responsibility, and as the Senate was to concur, there would be security.” If the Senate simply approves the president’s nominee “out of courtesy” or because they will just get another nominee standing before them with similar views, they are refusing to protect the American people by failing to check the president.

The Founders saw the danger of too much power in the hands of the executive and established means to protect the republic from tyranny. George Mason asserted that giving the executive such power was “dangerous” because it would allow him influence over the judiciary department itself, further expanding his power.

Luther Martin of Maryland was concerned that if the president’s appointment powers were not checked, then the president would be king “in every thing but the name.” Martin pointed out that even though the president is chosen to serve for a limited time, if he is given the sole authority of appointments, he will have established lasting power through his appointees.

The power of the Senate to check the president in the appointment process is not something to ignore in the name of courtesy or pragmatism. It is a power to exert, and when faced with a nominee for attorney general who supports executive lawlessness, opposes voting ID laws, misapplies civil rights as they relate to local police departments, supports the federal government in taking private property, and has no qualms about using drones against American citizens, the Senate must act. Otherwise we have, as the Founders said, crowned a king in the halls of liberty.

14 Things You Should Understand About Guns Before Writing About Them,"Guns can be dangerous in the wrong hands. But so are articles about guns written by people who don’t understand anything about them.

There’s sadly no excuse to be ignorant about firearms. They’ve been around for hundreds of years. They’re owned and operated safely by tens of millions of Americans each year. Our Constitution guarantees our individual right to possess guns so that we might be able to defend ourselves from those who would violently take away our freedom. Many gun controllers, however — some of whom have bylines for major media organizations — don’t actually know the first thing about firearms.

Here’s a good example of the kind of self-inflicted injury that can result from weaponizing an ill-informed opinion about guns and gun-related paraphernalia, courtesy of Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post:

I believe these are rubber bullets, can anyone confirm? #Fergurson pic.twitter.com/iCsFi6qoIa



Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) August 17, 2014

Unfortunately, Reilly is hardly alone in his complete ignorance of how guns work. Our nation is facing an epidemic of gun-related misreporting. As a public service to those who have opinions about guns but don’t really want to spend much time learning anything about them, I’ve compiled a simple list of 14 basic things everyone should understand before writing or talking about guns.

1) Don’t Lecture Anyone On Gun Safety Until You Understand The Basic Rules

These are rules literally every person should understand, because you never know when you might be in a situation that requires you to handle a firearm. To seasoned gun owners, these basic gun safety rules are gospel. If faithfully followed, they will prevent the likelihood of you ever shooting someone who did not pose an immediate and mortal threat to an innocent person.

1. Treat all guns as though they are loaded.

2. Never point the muzzle at anything you don’t intend to destroy.

3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you’re prepared to fire.

4. Always confirm your target, as well as what’s in front, behind, and around it.

Each rule is effectively a backup in case you ignore a previous rule. If you always assume a gun is loaded, then you’ll never have to say, “Your Honor, I didn’t know it was loaded.” If you screw up the first rule, the rule #2 will prevent you from shooting someone unintentionally, because your muzzle will always be pointed in a safe direction. If you screw up the first and second rules, rule #3 will ensure that the weapon is never actually discharged. And in the event that you believe your life is in mortal danger, rule #4 will prevent you from firing on an individual who’s a non-threat, or prevent you from firing through a threat into an innocent person.

These gun safety rules are to be practiced all the time, without exception. At the range. In your home. When you are carrying. When you’re not carrying. When a gun is loaded. When a gun is empty (remember: it’s never empty). The rules exist to protect you and everyone around you from harm. Memorize them. Practice them. And don’t lecture anyone on “gun control” or “gun safety,” the new gun-controller-approved euphemism for gun control, until you can effortlessly recite them and explain why they are so important.

It’s a simple test: if a gun controller wants to tell you what is or isn’t safe, ask them to tell you the four basic rules of gun safety. If they can’t or won’t, then you’ll know they’re more interested in demagoguery than they are in promoting safe gun handling.

2) Guns Are Inanimate Objects

“Guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” may be widely mocked by ignorant gun controllers, but it’s true (also true is the fact that guns don’t kill people, bullets do, if we want to be really pedantic). A gun cannot load a magazine by itself. A gun cannot secure a loaded magazine by itself. An empty gun cannot chamber a round or rack the slide by itself. A gun cannot pull a trigger by itself. Each of these actions requires agency by a human being.

These are all reasons why I personally dislike the term “accidental” shooting, because it suggests a lack of accountability and responsibility. A more appropriate term is “negligent” shooting, since human action is required to load a magazine, secure the loaded magazine, chamber a round, and pull the trigger. It’s why the basic gun safety rules are so important: if followed religiously, they reduce the probability of negligent shootings to 0%.

But what about intentional shootings where innocent people are targeted? Those don’t just require human agency, they require criminal intent. That’s why we try and punish criminals, rather than their weapons. It’s why gun criminals are sent to prison, while the criminals’ guns are often sent to the auction block. Criminal will is a far more dangerous and eternal thing than a simple firearm. It explains why so many criminals use illegally obtained weapons in their crimes. Why, it’s almost as though they don’t care about laws at all!

The mind that wishes to snuff out an innocent human life is far more terrifying than whatever inanimate object he or she decides to use. Don’t blame the tool; blame the individual who wishes to use it for evil.

3) Modern Guns Do Not Accidentally “Go Off”

As noted in the previous example, in order for a gun to go “BANG!” a specific sequence of events must occur, and each event requires human intervention. Modern handguns do not accidentally go “BANG!” That’s just not how guns work. Even a loaded gun, with a chambered round, with the safety off and the hammer/striker cocked will not just “go off” by itself. The trigger must still be pressed to release the firing pin or striker.

One thing that drives me nuts when I read it in the news is how a gun “went off.” Note the passive voice.

Whether intentional or not, this type of phrasing implies that the gun itself is the hazard, rather than the person handling it. Guns don’t “go off.” They’re fired by people. This is why the term “accidental shooting” is a misnomer. Unintentional, perhaps. Inadvertent, maybe. But guns don’t accidentally end up in a state that allows them to be fired, and they certainly don’t fire themselves.

A better term is “negligent shooting.” Negligence is the proper characterization because it accurately reflects the fact that an individual neglected to follow each of the basic gun safety rules. And for gun owners, the term negligence helps foster the proper mindset for gun handling: if this weapon is discharged, it is because of something you did. Therefore, don’t ever allow your weapon to be discharged unless it is to neutralize a mortal threat to you or another innocent individual.

4) “Semi-Automatic” And “Automatic” Are Not Synonyms

If you want people to understand that you have no clue what you’re talking about, by all means conflate “automatic” and “semi-automatic.”

An automatic firearm is one in which a single trigger pull can discharge multiple rounds. In the U.S., civilians are virtually banned from owning automatic weapons. If a truly automatic weapon is used in a crime, you can almost guarantee that it was obtained illegally.

In contrast to an automatic weapon, a semi-automatic weapon will at most discharge one round with a single trigger pull. What makes it semi-automatic rather than fully automatic is that the recoil generated from firing one round results in the weapon chambering another round, assuming the magazine is not empty, but without firing the second round (as opposed to a fully automatic, which both chambers and fires multiple rounds with one trigger pull). If we’re being really technical, a semi-automatic weapon is one in which a single trigger pull 1) discharges at most one round, 2) cocks the hammer or striker after the round is fired, and 3) chambers an additional round after the weapon discharges a round and extracts/ejects the shell casing, all without requiring any additional mechanical energy from the gun’s operator.

The second part of that definition is important because it is what differentiates a typical revolver from a semi-automatic pistol. Although a revolver is capable of chambering a round after a previous one is fired, the hammer must still be cocked by the user before another round can be fired (either via a double-action trigger or a manual cocking of the hammer).

5) “Clip” And “Magazine” Are Not Synonyms

If you watch the news or movies in which firearms are used, you’ll often hear the terms “clip” and “magazine” used interchangeably. They’re not synonyms, though. Here’s a helpful illustration of the difference:

A clip is exactly that: it clips rounds together so that they can more easily be fed into a magazine or directly into a weapon’s chamber. A clip has zero moving parts. All it does is clip ammunition together.

Magazines contain moving parts, most often springs. They are inserted directly into and remain in a firearm, unlike clips. The springs move another round into position so it can be chambered when necessary. In a traditional semi-automatic pistol, when a round is stripped from the top of a magazine and chambered by the rack sliding forward, the spring-powered magazine automatically pushes the next round into position to be chambered. When the round in the chamber is fired, the recoil propels the slide backwards and ejects the spent shell casing. Then, as the slide moves forward into battery, it strips the top round from the magazine and inserts it into the chamber.

This animation of the firing cycle of a 1911-style pistol clearly illustrates how a semi-automatic pistol generally works:





6) Gun Safeties Can And Will Fail

Although it’s become something of a cliche in firearm handling courses, it is absolutely true that “the only safety that matters is the one between your ears.” Like any inanimate object, no gun is foolproof. Mechanical devices can and will fail. If you rely on your gun’s external safety as a substitute for following the four basic gun safety rules, you’re going to get yourself into trouble. This doesn’t mean gun safeties are bad. They’re not at all. They’re incredibly valuable. But a mechanical safety in and of itself is not a guaranteed way to prevent a negligent discharge. Some manufacturers such as Glock do not even install external mechanical safeties on their firearms. The only way to prevent a negligent discharge from a firearm is to follow the four basic gun safety rules 100 percent of the time.

7) So-Called “Smart Gun” Technology Is Not Reliable

So-called “smart guns” are all the rage among gun controllers these days. What are “smart guns”? In theory, they’re guns outfitted with technology that renders the weapon inoperable if it is wielded by anyone other than its lawful owner. In theory, “smart gun” technology sounds like an interesting concept. But some gun controllers want to make it mandatory:

There has been renewed interest in smart guns since the Newtown school shooting, which reinvigorated the gun-control debate. However, there is immense pressure not to be the first to sell them. That’s because of a New Jersey law passed in 2002 known as the Childproof Handgun Law, which says that all guns sold in New Jersey must be state-approved smart guns within three years of a smart gun being sold anywhere in the country. The goal was to make smart guns mandatory as soon as the technology existed. Officially, no smart gun has been sold in the US yet — meaning if Raymond had sold one, it would have triggered the clause in New Jersey.

@johntabin @seanmdav Not so. Smart gun technology advances gun safety. Yet it encounters severe opposition by the gun lobby that wishes,



David Frum (@davidfrum) November 5, 2014

In practice, the unproven and unreliable technology demanded by gun controllers is a disaster waiting to happen. As noted in a previous example, mechanical safeties fail. So do electronic devices. Now imagine putting an electronic device subject to radio interference in charge of whether a gun can be fired. Heck, simple biometric gun safes are not even 100% reliable. Batteries fail. Software fails. Circuits short out. Fingerprint readers can quickly become unreliable. And what happens if your smart-gun triggering wristband is shot or otherwise damaged by a home invader? You and your family are completely out of luck.

There’s a reason there’s absolutely zero market for “smart guns” among people who actually understand how guns work: the technology is completely unreliable. The basic gun safety rules, though, are airtight. It shouldn’t surprise us that people who don’t even understand basic gun mechanics or safety rules want to mandate completely unreliable technology.

This isn’t to say the underlying technology isn’t useful. It can be. One police force is considering using the technology to alert the department whenever an officer’s gun is unholstered or discharged.

If individuals or organizations decide on their own to implement a new, untested technology, they’re free to do so. But mandating unreliable “smart gun” technology is a very dumb thing to do.

8) Handing Someone A Badge Doesn’t Make Him A Good Shooter

Accurately shooting a gun is not like using a camera. It’s not a simple “point and click.” Like any skill — yes, shooting is a skill — shooting a gun accurately requires constant practice and discipline. Firearm presentation, sight acquisition and alignment, trigger discipline, and follow-through are each skills that must be painstakingly developed before one can consider himself an accurate and reliable shooter. Shooters who can go from the holster to breaking multiple shots on target in less than a second didn’t get there by accident. It likely took hundreds of hours and thousands of rounds of practice.

The same is true for police. The badge does not confer magical shooting abilities. And contrary to much public opinion, the level of training received by most everyday patrolmen is not close to being enough to make an individual a highly reliable and accurate shooter. Moreover, the annual or semi-annual firearms qualifications required in most departments are hardly stringent. Here are the qualification standards for Wisconsin law enforcement officials:

Over 40 percent of rounds are fired within 3 yards. Over 85 percent are within 7 yards. Officers are required to fire only 12 shots at a distance of 15 yards or greater, and only ten of those must hit a target. Quite simply, you do not need to be a proficient shooter to pass a test like that.

In 2007, the New York Times wrote about systemic problems with police shooting accuracy:

New York City police statistics show that simply hitting a target, let alone hitting it in a specific spot, is a difficult challenge. In 2006, in cases where police officers intentionally fired a gun at a person, they discharged 364 bullets and hit their target 103 times, for a hit rate of 28.3 percent, according to the department’s Firearms Discharge Report. The police shot and killed 13 people last year.



In 2005, officers fired 472 times in the same circumstances, hitting their mark 82 times, for a 17.4 percent hit rate. They shot and killed nine people that year.



In all shootings — including those against people, animals and in suicides and other situations — New York City officers achieved a 34 percent accuracy rate (182 out of 540), and a 43 percent accuracy rate when the target ranged from zero to six feet away. Nearly half the shots they fired last year were within that distance.

Does this mean that all cops are terrible shots? Absolutely not. Cops who want to be good shooters, rather than cops who wear a gun only because they have to, are generally terrific shooters. The police officers that I’ve competed with in defensive pistol shooting competitions are incredible. Many enjoyed shooting to begin with and became cops because the job gave them the ability to practice and develop their skills as shooters more than any other line of work. But they didn’t become highly proficient shooters just because they chose to wear a uniform and a badge. It’s because they put in the time necessary to develop and maintain their shooting skills.

Unfortunately, police budget constraints make this type of training unfeasible for most departments.

9) The “AR” In “AR-15” Doesn’t Stand For “Assault Rifle”

That’s right. The “AR” in the name of the popular AR-15 doesn’t stand for “assault rifle.” It stands for ArmaLite, the company that developed the rifle platform back in the 1950’s. Today, the “AR-15” trademark is owned by Colt, which bought the rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 from ArmaLite in 1959. However, the term AR-15 has come to represent just about any type of conventional M4- or M16-variant rifle.

10) High Capacity Magazine Bans Are Completely Counterproductive

In the wake of the Aurora movie theater shooting in Colorado, lawmakers in the state swiftly enacted bans on high capacity ammunition magazines. Just as that state’s rush to close the inaccurately named “gunshow loophole” following the Columbine massacre failed to prevent the Aurora shooting, so to will the magazine ban fail to prevent future mass shootings.

Member of Congress pushing for a ban on high capacity magazines does not appear to understand what a magazine IS. http://t.co/15uDAh6REs



Scott McGrew (@ScottMcGrew) April 4, 2013

Why? For the same reason that gun bans don’t prevent criminals from possessing and using guns: they don’t care about gun laws. A psychopath intent on murdering a roomful of innocent people is not going to care if it’s illegal to possess a 16-round magazine. And there’s a good chance he’s going to bring with him an armory of high capacity magazines loaded to capacity.

That’s not the case for people who obey laws, though. The woman who lawfully carries a concealed weapon to protect herself from would-be rapists is going to follow the law, because she doesn’t want to put herself in jeopardy. Furthermore, the desire to legally carry a concealed weapon already puts a law-abiding citizen at a disadvantage against a murderer who’s armed to the teeth. How? Because the requirement of concealment almost by definition limits the amount of ammunition you can carry. In most cases, that means one magazine in the gun along with one spare magazine.

As the police statistics above showed, a few rounds may not be enough to neutralize multiple attackers. In some cases, you could empty a magazine against an assailant without neutralizing the threat (this is especially true against attackers who may be hopped up on drugs or wearing body armor). Contrary to the movies, merely shooting someone in the chest may not immediately incapacitate the threat. Only a direct shot to the central nervous system can instantly incapacitate an attacker (generally a shot inside the triangle formed by the eyes and nose), and those shots are incredibly difficult, especially against a target that may be moving.

Just like gun bans serve only to prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves, high capacity magazine bans put lawful gun carriers at a distinct disadvantage against well-armed assailants. As a result, it’s really not all surprising that Colorado, which twice voted for Barack Obama, voted to oust the Democratic state Senate president who pushed through that state’s mag ban.

11) “Shoot To Wound” Is Absurd And Dangerous

Whenever you hear about a fatal police shooting, you’re almost guaranteed to see a commentator wonder aloud why police aren’t trained to “shoot to wound.” The simple answer is that it’s because the police aren’t idiots. “Shoot to wound” is a terrible idea that also happens to be incredibly unsafe.

Do police Ever Shoot “2 Wound?”Can Arms, Legs,Shoulders b Targets?The STRESS MUST B UNBEARABLE,but is there Enough “Judgement”Training?



Cher (@cher) November 27, 2014

To begin with, a gun is considered a deadly weapon for a reason. Merely firing a gun constitutes the discharge of deadly force, and the discharge of deadly force is only legal if the person discharging it reasonably believes that his or her life (or that of an another innocent individual) is in mortal danger.

Now, if you believe yourself to be in mortal danger, would you fire at someone’s foot, or hand, or knee? Of course not. Why? Because shots to those areas do not prevent an assailant from shooting back at you. Instead, you would shoot at center mass, and in the event that those shots failed to neutralize the threat, you would aim for the head and the individual’s central nervous system. The notion of “shooting to wound” flies in the face of only shooting to neutralize a mortal threat. If you believe a threat can be neutralized without the use of deadly force, then you just lost your legal justification for discharging deadly force — in this case, firing a gun.

Furthermore, shooting at a moving appendage like an arm or leg is incredibly difficult, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stray round that could injure an innocent bystander. Bullets that hit those body parts are also more likely to overpenetrate, rather than stopping inside the intended target’s body. This doesn’t mean that you should necessarily shoot to kill. You are not justified in killing a person who has been clearly neutralized and no longer poses a threat. Your goal in discharging a deadly weapon is not to end a life. Your goal is to neutralize a mortal threat.

Never discharge your weapon unless you believe your life or that of another innocent person is in imminent mortal danger. And then, if you choose to shoot, shoot to neutralize the threat.

12) Hollow Point Bullets Are Actually Safer Than Standard Full Metal Jacket Ammunition

Whenever a reporter, gun controller, screenwriter, or general ignoramus wants to make ammunition sound super dangerous and sketchy, they’ll talk about “hollow point bullets.” What these people don’t understand is that hollow points are actually far safer than standard full metal jacket (FMJ), or ball, ammunition. Why? Because they’re less likely to overpenetrate.

Because of their shape and the speed at which they’re traveling, standard bullets have a tendency to go through things like walls, cars, people, etc. The result is that while you might hit your intended target, that bullet could continue to travel through the target and into someone or something you didn’t intend to hit. This is why rule #4 of the basic safety gun rules exists.

Ninth Circuit blesses San Fran's trigger lock requirement and ban on the sale of hollow-point bullets http://t.co/N6wdGtrDvp



Joe Palazzolo (@joe_palazzolo) March 25, 2014



So what does this have to do with hollow points? Because of how they’re designed — the hollow point opens upon impact, similar to how a flower blooms, thereby increasing drag and greatly reducing projectile speed — they greatly reduce the chance of overpenetration (for the same reason, hollow points are also not even close to being “armor-piercing”). How does that make them safer? The reduced bullet penetration reduces the likelihood of the bullet you fired on target hitting someone or something it wasn’t supposed to hit. Now, hollow points are definitely not safer for the person who’s hit by them. The opening of the bullet upon impact increases the effective diameter of the bullet, which leads to greater damage to the target.

That also makes it safer for all innocent bystanders, though. Why? Because you likely will not need to put as many shots on target in order to neutralize the threat. Fewer shots needed on target means fewer shots that need to be fired, which means a lower likelihood of an innocent person being hit. If you keep a gun in your home or on your body for personal protection, you absolutely should be using some type of hollow point ammunition, not FMJ ammunition, because FMJ ammunition is more likely to penetrate through walls and endanger whoever happens to be on the other side of them. FMJ ammunition should be reserved almost exclusively for the gun range.

13) Most Gun Owners Understand Gun Laws A Lot Better Than Gun Controllers Do

While I don’t doubt the desire of many gun controllers to reduce gun violence in the country, I do doubt their understanding of federal, state, and local gun laws in the U.S. A person who carries a weapon every day is far more likely to know the particulars of his or her state’s gun laws, because that person is in legal jeopardy in the event that he or she gets the law wrong. People who get paid to talk on TV for a living will not pay any real penalty if they completely screw up a state’s gun laws. An individual with a gun, however, can pay a very severe price if they don’t follow every gun law to the letter. Just ask this man, who faces a decade in prison for possessing an antique 18th-century flintlock pistol.

The controversy around the so-called “gun show loophole” is a perfect example of basic ignorance about the nation’s gun laws and their effects.

@scott_stephen 90% of Americans favor ending the gun show loophole but NRA owns enough Dems and GOPs to block even having a vote.



John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) December 27, 2014

There is no gun show loophole, period. The vast majority of gun show sales are conducted by federal firearms licensees, or FFLs, and FFL sales are strictly regulated by the federal government. Every FFL sale must be accompanied by a background check. No ifs, ands, or buts. Every sale of a firearm across state lines — for example, a resident of State A buying a gun in State B — must be processed by an FFL in the purchaser’s state. And what did we just learn about FFL sales? You can’t buy a gun from an FFL without undergoing a background check.

At the federal level (this is a key distinction), the only type of purchase that doesn’t require a background check is a private transaction between two individuals who reside in the same state. Gun shows have absolutely nothing to do with it. And if you think a federal universal background check is going to keep criminals from buying guns from each other, then I’d like to know why it hasn’t prevented them from buying drugs from each other.

14) “Universal Background Checks” Are Already The Law In Many States

What gun controllers won’t tell you is that “universal background checks” are the norm in a large number of states, notwithstanding the lack of a federal law requiring universal background checks. The gun controllers know this, but they’d rather force a one-size-fits-all federal policy one time than take the time and effort required to convince each state that it’s a good policy for that state.

Take Illinois, for example. Illinois requires universal background checks on all firearms purchases. Until recently, the city of Chicago virtually banned gun possession. Did those laws do anything to curb violent crime in the state? Of course not. Other states that require universal background checks on all firearms purchases include California and New York. How’s violent crime in those states, other than really high?

Some states require universal background checks only on handguns. North Carolina is one of those states. It requires either a concealed carry permit or a government-issued purchase permit, both of which require background checks, before an individual can purchase a handgun. In this case, two background checks are completed if you purchase a handgun from an FFL in North Carolina: once by the county that issues your purchase permit, and once by the FFL that sells you your handgun. Why do I single out North Carolina? Because it was in North Carolina that a crazed leftist armed with a handgun allegedly murdered three young Muslims over what appears to be a parking dispute. He passed his background check with flying colors.

The takeaway? No amount of gun laws or do-goodery is going to keep guns out of the hands of evil people. But those laws can keep guns out of the hands of careful, safe, law-abiding citizens who just want to protect themselves and their families. And that should be a crime.

"The Police No Longer Work For You, Chicago Interrogations Edition","Recently I wrote that, in many localities and for all intents and purposes, the police no longer work for you: depending on where you live, there is a high probability that local law enforcement runs like a corrupt banana republic goon squad and that your life and property are at very high risk in a very real way.

A notable example came from Fairfax County in Northern Virginia, where these days the cops bust high-stakes poker games and steal as much money as they can from innocent card-players. Not to be outdone, I see Chicago has apparently been running its very own Ministry of Love on the west side of the city:

The Chicago police department operates an off-the-books interrogation compound, rendering Americans unable to be found by family or attorneys while locked inside what lawyers say is the domestic equivalent of a CIA black site.



The facility, a nondescript warehouse on Chicago’s west side known as Homan Square, has long been the scene of secretive work by special police units. Interviews with local attorneys and one protester who spent the better part of a day shackled in Homan Square describe operations that deny access to basic constitutional rights.

This being Chicago, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised to find that the cops have resorted to such cowardly and unscrupulous tactics. Then again, in a broader sense there isn’t much to be surprised about.

Our Police System Needs Reform

In recent years, Americans have shown a startling and dismaying tendency to put up with the most unseemly, violent, and illegal behavior from their local police departments. Many of us are still at least nominally suspicious of the federal government, but when it comes to the police, we seem almost eager to roll over and allow them to do as they please. For all the Twitter indignation this story will cause, I’m sadly convinced it won’t in the end really matter. Probably nothing will change, Chicago police will continue to abuse the fundamental rights of their constituents, and everyone will soon forget that this was ever even a brief Internet Moral Outrage. Increasingly, this is who we are as a people.

Police reform—the kind that would end the barbarism in Chicago—will not come from the ranks of the police; it will come from Americans, if we can ever rouse the motivation to actually care about it.

Without substantial reform, there is little we can do to fix this sad state of affairs in which police officers are flagrantly contemptuous of the law yet suffer no consequences. Police officers, like public school teachers, have strong unions; like public teacher unions, police unions often work for the benefit of their inept and inadequate members. The purpose of a union is generally not to make the world a better place but to enrich and insulate the people lucky enough to be a part of the union itself.

There’s a reason, for instance, that it’s called the American Federation of Teachers and not Teaching. Then too, police unions do not exist to make the enforcement of law more equitable and egalitarian; more often than not they work to shield unfit and violent men and women from the just consequences of their actions (occasionally they work hard to stifle competition, as well). Police reform—the kind that would end the barbarism in Chicago—will not come from the ranks of the police; it will come from Americans, if we can ever rouse the motivation to actually care about it.

Militarizing the Police Makes Things Worse

In the meantime, we can expect things to continue apace. Even before the revelations of Chicago’s alleged “black site” at Homan Square, there was evidence that the Chicago Police Department was a corrupt and amoral organization: thievery, intimidation of whistleblowers and threats of violence appear to be the norm in the department (as reported by a police officer at Homan Square, no less). Many Illinois police forces, like police across the country, have benefitted from the LESO military equipment program and have received numerous military-grade weapons and vehicles—presumably to deal with the ruthless terrorist cells one finds in towns like Carbondale and Mechanicsburg.

Where an illegal and brutal government action would be soundly rebuked by the Right if done by the ATF, many of the same people are indifferent or even supportive of the same thing when done by a cop from a nearby police station.

The militarized armament alongside the corruption and black ops is not an accident or a coincidence. When police officers disdain and abuse peoples’ basic liberties, they will ultimately become afraid and wary of the people themselves. There is exactly no real reason for the sheriff’s department of Kankakee, Illinois to possess a Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle. The county lists exactly one line-of-duty death, all the way back in 1986. Nevertheless, the county apparently feels the need to prepare for both mines and ambushes. What does that say about county leaders’ feelings towards their constituents?

There is a sad tendency among my fellow conservatives and libertarians to give an enormous amount of deference to local police forces: where an illegal and brutal government action would be soundly rebuked by the Right if done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, many of the same people are indifferent or even supportive of the same thing when done by a cop from a nearby police station.

“We need to support our police officers,” they claim. “They are heroes who do thankless work without which we’d all be in danger.” Assuredly this is true in many cases, and our gratitude should go to the brave men and women who keep us free from harm each day and in an unglamorous way. Yet cops are not saints. Some of them are incompetent, vicious, unfit to hold a badge, and deserving of great moral censure, if not legal consequences. Learning to tell the difference between good cops and violent and corrupt cops is vital if we are to remain a free society and a free people. We either make the distinction, or we end up like Chicago—a dismal thing to contemplate, even by banana republic standards.

Six Questions About The Justice Department’s Ferguson Report,"It’s official. The Ferguson Police Department is racist. That, at any rate, was the quick takeaway from a report released yesterday on the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation of law enforcement in Ferguson, Missouri.

Ferguson became infamous last year when Officer Darren Wilson’s fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked protests, riots, and a torrent of national scrutiny. Interestingly, the investigation effectively vindicated Wilson. But it also concluded that the FPD has demonstrated a pattern of abuses that have built resentment and racial tension, particularly among Ferguson’s African-American community.

It sounds bad. Here are some questions we should ask in light of the report:

1. Is there any chance government might actually stop using police departments as a source of revenue?

Though this point has been muted in press, it’s actually a major component of the report. Ferguson bureaucrats, we are told, put significant pressure on the police to issue as many citations as possible, to the point of disciplining or demoting them if they don’t write enough tickets. Why do they do this? For the money, obviously. Bureaucrats aren’t terribly interested in on-the-street details as long as the cash keeps coming.

We all get angry when we feel the police are using the law as an excuse to shake us down.

The Justice Department thinks cops should prioritize law and public safety. We should stop using them as de facto tax collectors.

Anyone opposed? I thought not. We all get angry when we feel the police are using the law as an excuse to shake us down. When police are pressured to be revenue-collectors, that undermines public trust, and (as the report suggests) motivates cops to abuse their authority. How much do we end up paying for that, in riot gear or vandalized property? If this report bolsters police departments’ ability to say “no” to greedy bureaucrats, that would be a pretty big upside.

2. What should we do about bully cops?

There are pages’ worth of anecdotes in this document, relating incident after incident in which cops do something regrettably familiar: act like bullies. They harass citizens on the barest of pretenses. They issue unreasonable or arbitrary orders. They find excuses to charge people with Disorderly Conduct or Failure to Comply when the real offense would best be described as Being Mouthy.

When minor laws are abused, citizens lose respect for order.

Not all cops are like this, of course. Even when they are, I can have some sympathy. It must be tough to spend your workday elbow-deep in human sin and suffering. That’s the sort of thing that can make a person bitter and hard.

But it’s still a problem. Bully cops may seem like a small-ish annoyance in the grander scheme, but think of them as the evil cousin to the “broken window” strategy of law enforcement. When minor laws are properly enforced, citizens gain a respect for order. When minor laws are abused, citizens lose respect for order. They also start resenting the police.

3. To what extent does ‘disparate impact’ actually point to systemic racism?

This, obviously, is the big one. It gets to the heart of the most explosive question: is the FPD racist?

The report cites a number of statistics intended to show that black residents of Ferguson are disproportionately impacted by police activity. They’re more likely to be stopped, more likely to be searched, and more likely to be ticketed for minor offenses. In some cases, the disparities are significant. African Americans make up 67 percent of the population of Ferguson, but accounted for 85 percent of traffic stops, 90 percent of citations, and 93 percent of arrests between 2012 and 2014.

‘Disparate impact’ analysis is not, in itself, adequate to prove systemic racism.

“Disparate impact” analysis is not, in itself, adequate to prove systemic racism. As Heather MacDonald recently explained at National Review, it’s unreasonable to draw definite conclusions from these numbers. It isn’t important whether African Americans represent a proportionate percentage of the population. The important question is: what percentage of violations do Ferguson’s African Americans commit?

Actually, the report does attempt to address this. It asserts multiple times that black residents of Ferguson are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement, even when controlling for other relevant factors. I’m not prepared to take the Justice Department’s word for that, but the assertion is backed up by at least some corroborating evidence. For example, African American drivers are significantly more likely to be stopped by the police in their cars, and significantly more likely to be searched. But searches of African American drivers are a bit less likely (23 percent) to uncover illegal contraband. That might suggest that cops are especially eager to stop and search drivers if they are black.

It’s something to consider. To be sure, pervasive and systemic racism isn’t the only possible explanation for those kinds of numbers. For instance, it looks as though the racial disparities for “stops” and “searches” are quite a bit larger than the disparity for finding contraband. Does that tell us anything? As with so many elements of this report, we can’t but wish for more context to help make sense of these numbers.

Given the explosive charges, it’s disappointing that the “racial bias” segment of the report only represents about 15 of its 100 pages. More analysis is clearly warranted. Again though, some of the disparities are big. It’s reasonable to want them explained more fully.

As with so many elements of this report, we can’t but wish for more context to help make sense of these numbers.

I put this question third for a reason, however. Let’s suppose, as the first two points imply, that the FPD (probably not uniquely in America) has grown somewhat over-aggressive about using the police to collect revenue, while also getting a bit lax about investigating complaints or disciplining bully cops. Let’s further stipulate that Ferguson is a place in which the cops are disproportionately white, and the criminals are disproportionately black. Is it surprising that this state of affairs might precipitate some “racial tensions”? Even if most cops aren’t individually racist, might this kind of soft abuse start to look (in a place with the demographics of Ferguson) a lot like racial injustice?

Of course, if that is the heart of this story, the good news is that we probably don’t need to pour our energies into hunting for bigots. We can focus on ensuring that policing is disciplined, honest and fair.

4. What’s up with these ‘canine bite’ incidents?

It’s a straight question. The report mentions that “in all 14 uses of force involving a canine bite for which we have information about the race of the person bitten, the person was African American.”

So, that’s interesting. How often do the police sic dogs on people? What’s the story here?

5. What other salacious emails did people send?

A lot of hay is being made in the press of the “seven racist emails” cited in the report, sent by government employees who (gasp!) still have jobs. Make no mistake: they’re offensive. A few were offensive enough to make me physically recoil from my computer screen. But we’re talking about a few emails plucked from a period spanning several years. How much does that actually tell us about politics in Ferguson? (And, dare I ask whether there were any anti-white emails in that giant mix? Okay, sorry, that was totally uncalled-for.)

6. Just in general, what’s it like to be a cop in a place like Ferguson?

This is really the question I find myself pondering at the end of this report. It tells us a good bit about how African Americans in Ferguson experience law enforcement. It doesn’t tell us much about how the world looks through a policeman’s eyes.

It would be nice to fill in that picture. If indeed Ferguson has developed an uncomfortable racial dynamic, that’s surely a two-way street to some degree. Now, don’t get me wrong. All things considered, the guy with the badge and gun has a responsibility to be the bigger person, especially in non-life-threatening situations. Even so, when we’re asking cops to (for example) leave the safety of their cars more often to interact with people on the street, it only seems fair to ask: how well would they be received? How safe would they feel?

Needless to say, Ferguson does not seem like a particularly healthy community from a criminal-justice perspective. Its problems likely are not wildly idiosyncratic. So even if Ferguson was, to some degree, “targeted” by the Justice Department (owing to an incident that almost certainly did not merit the attention it received), it would still be nice to use this information to get more perspective on what is happening in communities like Ferguson. For that, we need to hear law enforcement’s side of the story. Your move, FPD.

Why Don’t Liberals Care About Racial Dynamics?,"I wish I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard liberals call for “a national conversation about race.” It’s wearyingly cliché at this point, so we get some variations in the language. Let’s “do some soul-searching” about America’s racial dynamics. Or perhaps we should have “a national reckoning leading to spiritual renewal”?

It’s a political “safe place” for liberals: spinning their wheels with righteous reminders of the value of dialogue. Such rhetoric is useless, of course, but don’t expect it to stop. Race is one of the few live issues liberals have left to make noise about, and every pundit and politician knows that, in this arena, it’s safest to “stay meta.” Affirming the value of bridge-building and conscience-examining is fairly painless. Actually discussing racial issues in any detail is sure to get people hot and bothered—as Jonathan Chait occasionally discovers to his discomfiture.

It’s Getting Lonely On This ‘National Conversation’ Train

I’m in. I’m willing to participate in this glorious national dialogue. It’s kind of surprising, though, how little is actually happening on the much-ballyhooed bandwagon.

A conversation definitely entails more than witch hunts and pious proclamations.

As I understand it, a discussion involves one person saying something relevant, and another person saying something different (but ideally also relevant). It allows for probing questions designed to fill out our appreciation of complicated realities. It definitely entails more than witch hunts and pious proclamations.

So how come most liberals seem interested only in the latter? They’re outraged by actual discussions of racial dynamics, which inevitably have potential to be unflattering to multiple parties. Liberals talk about systemic racism, which ostensibly asks us to look beyond the attitudes of specific individuals, considering instead the general ways in which social, economic, and political factors might work to the disadvantage of particular minority groups. It sounds compelling. Don’t make the mistake of thinking, though, that most liberals actually want to discuss these things.

Last week, I angered several writers at Slate by raising some questions about racial dynamics in Ferguson, Missouri, inspired by the U.S. Department of Justice’s report on the Ferguson Police Department. My critics seemed to think I was a de facto PR rep for the FPD. It’s a good thing I’m not, because I’d have lost that job in a New York minute.

Anyone Want to Do More than Use Ferguson as a Talking Point?

I’m definitely concerned about the racial dynamics of Ferguson. It seems reasonable to think, based on DOJ’s reports, that residents may have suffered from abuses of police authority. I think an honest reader would clearly see these concerns in Friday’s piece, and also in my previous writings on the subject.

Any interest in understanding what’s really going on in Ferguson, and other similar neighborhoods across America?

Here’s what I’m wondering, though. Do we care about anything other than delivering a verdict on the FPD? Any interest, perhaps, in understanding what’s really going on in Ferguson, and other similar neighborhoods across America? Or is our scope of concern purely limited to determining whether future speechwriters may justifiably toss Ferguson into their orations in the same breath as Rodney King?

Personally, I want more than platitudes and ritual ablutions. I hate racism, and I hate even more the fact that so many children in this country (very disproportionately African-American) are born with slim odds of ever leading productive and happy lives. I’d like to think America can do better. But I also have to note that, in the past, many efforts to achieve social justice really haven’t made things better.

Race Relations Are Complicated

So, yes, morally indignant Slate writers. We should ask what it’s like to be a cop in Ferguson. It’s appropriate to wonder whether Ferguson’s black residents are the only ones who feel threatened and angry, or whether whites (or other ethnic groups) also feel mistreated or marginalized on account of their race. Although several commentators regarded these questions as “mortifying,” it’s irresponsible to make sweeping moral pronouncements based on a deliberately targeted picture of a single tree in a large forest.

In America today, significantly more men are convicted of felonies than women. Is that proof that the justice system is sexist?

As noted in my previous piece, one problem with the DOJ report is its reliance on “disparate impact” to make its point. A disparate impact study, as Thomas Sowell explained this week in National Review Online, is always hard to interpret because there are many extraneous factors that can explain why one segment of the population is more affected than another by (in this case) law enforcement. In America today, for example, significantly more men are convicted of felonies than women. Is that proof that the justice system is sexist? Surely not. We need more information to make that determination, most obviously about who is committing crimes.

Even without providing definitive proof of anything, however, a disparate impact study can reasonably raise questions (or eyebrows). I think this one does, even recognizing that the Department of Justice surely had political motivations to find a blameworthy party in Ferguson, particularly in light of its exoneration of Officer Darren Wilson. Reading through it, one finds quite a lot of numbers in the nineties (as in, 94 percent of municipal court citations?) and it would be interesting to hear experienced police officers discuss this. Are there good reasons why non-contraband-carrying black drivers are more likely to be stopped than white ones? Is it true that “bully cops” are harassing certain demographics much more than others?

As for Ferguson Itself, It’s Complicated, Too

Very likely, the reality would be murky and complicated. Ferguson’s story really is quite interesting, as Walter Russell Mead explained at The American Interest. It’s a suburban area that has seen a large influx of African American residents over the last 25 years. Most of them came from impoverished urban areas, so for some of its newer residents, Ferguson represents a step up in the world. It really isn’t a slum; only about 20 percent of its residents live below the poverty line. But demographic shifts have created an uneasy cultural brew, which has surely been exacerbated by the same unhappy trends that have dimmed the prospects of lower-middle-class Americans everywhere. People worry about “what’s happening to the neighborhood,” and about their children’s future prospects.

It would be a little short-sighted to read the arrest-warrant statistics and stop there.

There’s definitely a racial component. A quarter-century ago, Ferguson was mostly white, and that older demographic picture is still reflected in the city’s civil services and political structures. Mead primarily cites unions as the reason for this, although it’s also worth noting that Ferguson’s black residents don’t vote in large numbers. (According to ThinkProgress, only 6 percent of black residents voted in their 2013 municipal elections.) Those factors might help to explain some soft, wagon-circling corruption in the bureaucracy and the police force. Unions are supposed to look out for their own; it’s their primary purpose. But that kind of in-grouping naturally breeds cronyism and give an edge to the neighborhood’s more-established families and sub-groups. For newcomers, that might be the sort of disadvantage which can foment civil unrest.

White civil servants, representing Ferguson’s new minority, may feel defensive and disoriented by changes in their neighborhood. The new black majority, for their part, are frustrated by a lack of opportunities in general, and especially by a sense that the political and civil structures are less open to them. It’s especially infuriating (as conservatives readily understand) to feel that one’s tax dollars are supporting people who are working for someone else’s agenda. (And, as Mead astutely notes, this frustration is likely to grow as union-negotiated pensions start placing larger and larger burdens on ordinary taxpayers.)

That’s quite a messy brew of interests and influences. It would be a little short-sighted to read the arrest-warrant statistics and stop there.

So You’re Saying the Whole Town Is Racist?

That’s what many have concluded by the “whiteness” of Ferguson’s political structure and of its civil servants. Again, race overlaps with many other factors, so it can be hard to isolate. But these numbers also raise questions about the ethics of ethnic solidarity. Is it always equivalent to racism? Once again, I think the issue is a bit more complicated than that. I suspect most of us, if we’re honest, already know that from experience.

Race overlaps with many other factors, so it can be hard to isolate.

I presently live in a safe, upper-middle-class neighborhood ringed by universities. A solid 69 percent of my ZIP-code residents graduated from college. It’s certainly not the sort of place where anyone notices or cares that my husband and I are (as one elderly relative put it) “an interracial couple.”

That sort of cosmopolitanism is generally born of a broad base of shared experiences (educational, professional, etc.), and also out of the basic fact that most people are established enough not to need an extensive neighborhood safety net. The whole world is not like this, nor, I expect, will it ever be.

I witnessed a very different dynamic one memorable summer 14 years ago, when my fresh-faced undergraduate self volunteered for eight weeks at an outreach organization in a Chicago slum. The area was overwhelmingly black. I lived with Catholic nuns on the top floor of a well-secured building, and my days were spent working with children, helping in a childcare center for working parents, and tutoring individual kids who were failing out of school. It was a certainly a new experience to drill phonics and basic arithmetic with pre-teens whom, I realized one day in a gut-wrenching moment of culture shock, might never learn these things if someone didn’t reach them very soon.

In my first week on the job, several people at the center warned me not to walk the streets by myself, even in the daytime. It wouldn’t be safe “for me.” If I got into trouble it was hard to say whether anyone would help. This reasoning generally wasn’t spelled out to the letter, but I got the drift.

Ethnic Solidarity Versus Racism

I didn’t really take offense. Yes, it was mildly alarming that residents of the area seemed to think my race might affect even such matters as whether their neighbors would dial 911 if I were being mugged. Then again, I was the outsider, and although the “otherness” of whites was obvious in that weirdly self-contained world, it didn’t really rise to the level of personal hatred, at least in most instances. It was more an issue of black identity and solidarity. I noticed, for example, how the children were delighted to include me in their games (I pushed a lot of swings that summer), but still regularly teased each other in my presence for being “white” (which usually denoted cowardice). I found that an amusing little expression of ethnic pride. Given the troubled history of African Americans in this country, it would hardly be reasonable to get indignant when such neighborhoods develop a sense of solidarity.

It was mildly alarming that residents of the area seemed to think my race might affect such matters as whether their neighbors would dial 911 if I were being mugged.

But sometimes that can be problematic. Racial dynamics can run the gamut from beautiful to horrific, and sometimes the good and ugly are closely conjoined. In Central Asia, where I lived for two years, people will actually ask your “nationality,” which they regard as a separate issue from citizenship or country of residence. They’re effectively asking about race, and it amuses them that Americans find this an uncomfortable question when they have it written right into their passports.

Does that sort of ethnic identification cause problems? Certainly not always. I found ethnic identification to be a source of pride and community for most people, and in general the various “nationalities” seemed to bump along fairly peaceably. Then again, as recently as 2010, violent conflicts that the United Nations labeled “ethnic cleansing” broke out between the Uzbeks and Kyrgyz just a few miles from where I used to work, leaving almost 200 dead. When ethnic groups develop a sense of “family,” there’s also the potential for “family feuds.”

Let’s return to Ferguson. It is obviously a place in which ethnic identification and solidarity play a noteworthy role in community life. That’s inevitably going to make for a complex interplay of interests and associations and, sometimes, grievances. This has been true (again, with mixed results) throughout own country’s history as well, as for example in New York City, where the often-hated Irish population found a refuge in the police force, and the Jews came to dominate the financial sector.

When ethnic groups develop a sense of ‘family,’ there’s also the potential for ‘family feuds.’

Suppose the white population of Ferguson suddenly found itself outnumbered by newcomers who seemed to regard it as their primary duty to take care of one another and not their new white neighbors? Would it be surprising if a similar dynamic developed in the unions and perhaps police force?

I shouldn’t need to say it, but for the sake of complete crystal clarity I will anyway: of course it is not okay if historical-ethnic connections, perhaps reinforced by established unions and entrenched political structures, have made it especially difficult for African Americans to establish themselves and build decent lives. It’s definitely not okay if that is indeed affecting how the law is enforced. It’s the kind of thing that does happen when demographics shift, but it’s obviously still a legitimate source of concern. Still, we can’t address those problems responsibly if we’re not even permitted to diagnose them.

Finding A Real Way Forward

Why is it that so many liberals, ostensibly burning with zeal for racial justice, are strangely uncurious about the details? Are they just too naive to appreciate the real complexity of human affairs? Or is it even worse than that?

If we managed to build a society where everyone has a reasonable chance to thrive, where would liberals get their political leverage?

Here’s the most damning possibility. Perhaps elite liberals don’t actually want to achieve racial harmony. If we managed to build a society where everyone has a reasonable chance to thrive, where would they get their political leverage? And how would elite secularists capture that delicious feeling of righteousness and moral superiority? Diagnosing race-related psychological-spiritual maladies is easy and satisfying on both levels, and why stop? It’s not as though race-related tensions can ever entirely be cured.

Moreover, real solutions to minority problems may well be unpalatable to progressive liberals. They might involve, for example, declawing unions and cracking down on tyrannical bureaucrats (in Ferguson’s case, mostly Democrats) who’ve forgotten that a police force is supposed to secure public safety, not fill holes in the budget by issuing unnecessary citations.

Real solutions might involve prudent entitlement reform, of a sort that promotes healthy family structures instead of undermining them. Reforming our prison system (an issue conservatives have taken up with far more zeal than their liberal counterparts) could help ease some of these problems. And everyone in middle America (especially in downscale neighborhoods like Ferguson) could benefit from more opportunity, more economic growth, and a mobility-oriented agenda that gives people from all backgrounds a chance to better their and their families’ prospects.

In all likelihood, these are the measures that stand a real chance of easing the frustration that we see boiling over among struggling minority groups. If we have a real conversation about race, is that where we’ll end up? No wonder liberals don’t want the details.

How To Arrest The Blame Game That Follows Cop Shootings,"What happens after a cop gets shot? There are a few things we can predict. Politicians who want to appear strong on crime hold press conferences and talk about “unwavering resolve” and “zero tolerance.” There is an outpouring of public sympathy. News media demonstrate exceptional creativity recounting the brave, harrowing ordeals—better than many prime-time cop dramas.

Of course, a populace fed by constant outrage on social media and the 24-hour news cycle soon forgets about the shooting. In a few weeks, the names are hard to remember. After a few months, most of us can’t distinguish between the various unspeakably violent events we have heard about. Will the names of the police who were shot in Ferguson be remembered in the same way we all remember the name (and ubiquitous hashtag) Michael Brown? Of course not.

I know this because my father was shot in the line of duty while trying to apprehend a criminal who had—earlier that same day—slit the throat of another police officer. My dad survived. The other cop left a wife and two young children behind.

Same Story, Different Cop Shooter

The parallels between my father’s experience and the recent shooting of two police officers in Ferguson couldn’t be clearer. The officers were shot simply for wearing the uniform.

The officers were shot simply for wearing the uniform.

These aren’t isolated incidents relegated to crucibles of racial disharmony like Ferguson, Missouri or Mobile, Alabama. A few months ago, you probably remember the two NYPD cops who were shot in the line of duty by a man who said he simply hated the police.

So what happens to officers who survive the shootings? They continue to relive the violence in dreams, thoughts, and maybe prayers. Perhaps they talk about it with a psychologist in a few free-for-a-limited-time counseling sessions that the local municipality permits after such experiences.

If history is any indication, we already know how the most recent Ferguson shooting will be politicized. We will have the hardliners shouting from their soapboxes about how the Left, in general, and Holder’s DOJ, specifically, somehow encouraged the violence against police because of their public sympathy for the protestors and the Brown family. Wouldn’t it be great if we could just skip this tired debate?

Let’s Dump the Blame Game

Let’s simply agree a few disturbed violent individuals should be held personally responsible for their actions. There is never so great a cognitive dissonance than when conservatives and hawkish libertarians—who crow about being the stalwart defenders of individual responsibility and self-reliance—blame the violent act of a wacko on some sort of wholly unrelated Leftist ideology.

Marxism doesn’t need to be rejected because a few nut jobs commit unspeakable acts of violence.

Marxism—and its thinly veiled cousins, postmodernism, critical race theory, and radical feminism—doesn’t need to be rejected because a few nut jobs commit unspeakable acts of violence. No, Marxism does a pretty good job of demonstrating its own deficiencies, especially if you have read anything about how collectivism turned out for Russia and Eastern Europe over the last century.

So, if we want to move past the silly, unproductive blame game, if we don’t want to feed the constant outrage that typifies our public discourse, then how might we respond to this shooting? I would like to suggest, in one word, a very radical way forward: hospitality.

By hospitality I don’t mean some namby-pamby “beer summit” like President Obama hosted for the police chief and university professor. Nor do I mean Obama’s oft-repeated exhortation to engage in a “national dialogue on race.” In fact, I think these ideas, and pretty much any “exploration of the problematic” born in academia will, in the end, do more harm than good.

How About We Love Our Neighbors

No, by hospitality, I mean a sort of intimate, personal fellowship that the faith community has been known to foster. It is a hospitality that could best be expressed in Judeo-Christian language that we find in the Bible (I know, I know—we have a marketing problem here; a subject for another article). This hospitality is typified by the story in Hebrews 13, which says that love of the Other is related to the love of God. Of course, many world religions have the same basic underpinning about loving one’s neighbor—but not all world religions fostered the great American civil-rights movement.

Many world religions have the same basic underpinning about loving one’s neighbor—but not all world religions fostered the great American civil-rights movement.

C.S. Lewis described Christian hospitality this way: “Next to the Blessed Sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses.”

We are only one generation removed from a time when the foremost advocates of social justice rooted their convictions in religious principle. Nowadays, we can expect social-justice warriors to appeal to Marxist sentiments like inequality, racial and gender disparities, and class warfare. They have traded MLK for Saul Alinsky.

One needn’t be a scholar in natural law to discern that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. borrowed language from the church. The social-justice warriors of today, in large part, borrow language from academics like Foucault and Derrida, who maintain that the individual must be subordinate to the institutional. Nebulous, poorly defined concepts like “social welfare” or the “common good” always trump individual human dignity in this degenerate calculus. Justice is never really about individual circumstances, but rather about institutions. Perhaps this is a clue as to why the protests continued in Ferguson long after the police officer in the Michael Brown case was cleared of wrongdoing.

We’re Confused Because We Don’t Understand People

Religious leaders are guilty of this shift in language too (and not just the “Rev.” Al Sharpton). Just look at the way my own denomination, the PCUSA, has approached the controversy in Ferguson: The director of public witness, J. Herbert Nelson, believes that federally mandated police de-militarization (and general gun control) will eradicate the scourge of racism in America. Talk forsaking the church’s proud legacy, Dr. Nelson!

The most intractable problems in our culture and politics are due to basic confusion about the nature of man.

The president of the Acton Institute, Father Robert Sirico, is fond of saying that if we don’t get the basic anthropology right, we will never get the other essential institutions right: not family, not schools, not government (and law enforcement), not art, and especially not church. In a talk at the Steamboat Institute a few months ago, Sirico made a strong case that the most intractable problems in our culture and politics are due to this basic confusion about the nature of man.

I believe that as long as the people debating #Ferguson continue to talk about the Other—whether the Other is police or minority communities—in a way that demonstrates a lack of deep commitment to and meaningful understanding of the fundamental dignity of each human being, then we will continue to talk past each other ad nauseum.

Social justice which eschews the individual for impersonal nonsense like surreptitious “structures of oppression,” “microaggressions,” and large-scale government interventions is doomed to not only fail, but to make the conversation much more rancorous. Would you be receptive to someone who did not recognize your worth and dignity as a human being? Of course not.

Issues of justice are always personal. This is a truth we need to rediscover. If we accept this basic premise, then we must accept that injustice cannot be corrected by some trick of bureaucratic wizardry. It takes the much harder work of developing deep personal relationships.

The DOJ’s ‘Trovato Report’ on Ferguson,"The demonstrations and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, had burned themselves out, in part because it was hard to sustain the outrage against “racist cops” after the narrative about the shooting of Michael Brown fell apart.

No, he wasn’t an innocent kid; he was a brutish strong-arm robber. No, police officer Darren Wilson did not attack Brown; it looks like it was the other way around, just as the officer claimed. And no, Brown did not have his hands up and wasn’t imploring the officer not to shoot; he had turned around and was charging toward him. So the whole “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative—trumpeted in the media for months—was based on a lie.

And yet now the Ferguson riots are back, reinflamed, resulting in the shooting of two police officers late last week by an attacker who was just arrested by Ferguson police. (Early reports indicate that he claims he was shooting at someone else and not at police. That seems implausible, but we’ll see how it holds up.)

How did this happen? Well, in part it was because the Ferguson Narrative was resurrected—and it was resurrected deliberately.

It was resurrected by the Justice Department report on the shooting of Michael Brown. Rather than limiting its investigation to the shooting itself and whether it was a violation of civil rights, the DOJ paired the report on the shooting with a wider investigation into the practices of the Ferguson, Missouri, police department and came back with a sweeping indictment of the city for racial animus and the deliberate targeting of black residents for police harassment and the constant financial drain of fines imposed for petty infractions.

You can see why they did this. The evidence compelled the DOJ to exonerate Darren Wilson and disavow every single piece of the “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative. But the report branding the Ferguson PD as racists allows them to resurrect that narrative.

So perhaps we should call this the Trovato Report—after Ben Trovato, the king of the narrative—because its purpose was not to examine the facts of this particular case, but to preserve the wider narrative of a nation so corrupted by institutional racism that it uses the police as a weapon to harass and intimidate blacks.

Special Trovato awards should go to folks like Jamelle Bouie and Ta-Nehisi Coates for the way they treated the report’s conclusions about Darren Wilson—completely validating the decision of the Ferguson grand jury and undermining every press hack who jumped on the Ferguson bandwagon—as a mere speed bump to rattle over on their way to the new narrative. Coates was the more gracious of the two, spending a few paragraphs to name in detail the report’s conclusions about Brown and Wilson.

The investigation concluded that physical evidence and witness statements corroborated Wilson’s claim that Michael Brown reached into the car and struck the officer. It concluded that claims that Wilson reached out and grabbed Brown first “were inconsistent with physical and forensic evidence.”



The investigation concluded that there was no evidence to contradict Wilson’s claim that Brown reached for his gun. The investigation concluded that Wilson did not shoot Brown in the back. That he did not shoot Brown as he was running away. That Brown did stop and turn toward Wilson. That in those next moments “several witnesses stated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson.” That claims that Brown had his hands up “in an unambiguous sign of surrender” are not supported by the “physical and forensic evidence,” and are sometimes, “materially inconsistent with that witness’s own prior statements with no explanation, credible for otherwise, as to why those accounts changed over time.”

But both writers moved on promptly to the claim that the police are the “true criminals” in Ferguson, according to Bouie—he makes no mention of the rioters who burned the city’s small businesses and makes no attempt to gauge how true their criminality was. Or that the cops are “gangsters,” according to Coates—who then goes on to browbeat blacks who believe in “personality responsibility” rather than chalking up everything to the vast conspiracy of “white supremacy.” And to explain why he was perfectly justified in assuming Wilson’s guilt. And, inevitably, to conclude that, “The innocence of Darren Wilson does not change this fundamental fact.”

You can see the Ben Trovato Rules in action. When you change narratives, never acknowledge the existence of your previous narrative if you can at all avoid it, and for God’s sake never apologize for getting the old narrative completely wrong. Always remember that individual facts may die, but the narrative lives on.

As it turns out, the new narrative has a few of its own problems with the facts. John Lott, former chief economist for the United States Sentencing Commission, notes that the DOJ report depends almost solely on statistics seeming to show disparities in how frequently Ferguson’s blacks are pulled over by officers or have arrest warrants issued for them. But these statistics are meaningless on their own, without controlling them for outside factors.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 2011 Police-Public Contact Survey indicates that, nationwide, blacks were 31 percent more likely than whites to be pulled over for a traffic stop.



Ferguson is a black-majority town. If its blacks were pulled over at the same rate as blacks nationally, they’d account for 87.5 percent of traffic stops.



In other words, the numbers actually suggest that Ferguson police may be slightly less likely to pull over black drivers than are their national counterparts. They certainly don’t show that Ferguson is a hotbed of racism….



In fact, blacks die in car accidents at a rate about twice their share of car owners…. This suggests that there are a lot of unsafe black drivers, not racism.

As for direct evidence of racial animus, the report relies on “seven emails from Ferguson police officers from 2008 to 2011,” which were deemed “offensive” by the DOJ investigators. Which seems like awfully few to be the smoking gun for systemic white supremacy.

And yet the report does uncover some real, serious problems in the way local governments are using, and misusing, law enforcement. But this has less to do with white than with green—less to do with racism than with an insatiable lust for government revenue, raised through a vast array of petty fines imposed on the citizenry. Black people in Ferguson were disproportionately poor and thus disproportionately hit by these nickle-and-diming fines. Here’s where the DOJ’s report hits home:

Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs. This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson’s police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing, and has also shaped its municipal court, leading to procedures that raise due process concerns and inflict unnecessary harm on members of the Ferguson community…. Partly as a consequence of City and FPD priorities, many officers appear to see some residents, especially those who live in Ferguson’s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.

This is backed up by evidence of Ferguson officials boasting, not about a reduction in crime rates or the superior safety of the streets, but about exceeding their targets for city revenue from fines. Racism is almost certainly a factor here, but it is a kind of opportunistic infection that gains purchase within a corrupt and corrupting system. When city officials wield so much arbitrary power, they are certainly going to be tempted by favoritism and blinded by indifference toward the sort of people they don’t like. For example, Ferguson’s municipal judge had designed a regime of niggling court fees—yet he was caught fixing parking tickets for his friends and owing $170,000 in unpaid personal and business taxes.

All of this reminded me of the story behind the killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, who died while resisting arrest for the utterly trivial offense of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a street corner. As I argued in that case, the more the police are tasked to enforce a vast array of petty controls—or revenue-raising fines—the more they are put into rough contact with the citizenry, with the potential for damage to the citizens’ dignity, their wallets, and their lives.

The real story here is summed up by an image that has been making its rounds on the Internet: a photo showing a horde of Occupy-style protesters on one side, marked with the label “wants more government”—clashing with police on the other side, who are marked with the label “more government.” (Here’s another variation.)

All of this could define an agenda for the reform that is really needed, not just in Ferguson, but in cities across the country. But it won’t be pursued, because it’s not part of the right narrative. It’s about limiting the reach of government and its attempts to raise revenue from citizens—whereas the left wants a narrative about how all-pervasive government would work just fine if it weren’t for those racist rednecks out there who keep abusing it.

So that’s what the DOJ’s Trovato Report delivered for them.

Race Baiting And Ferguson,"The most recent news from Ferguson concerns what Eric Holder has rightly called the “ambush shooting” of two police officers outside the city’s police department. This incident occurred in the wake of two detailed reports released by the Department of Justice. The first report deals in depth with the shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. The report recommended that the case against him be closed. The second DOJ report contained a scathing indictment of the sad state of affairs within the entire criminal justice system of Ferguson. The combined effect of these two reports is likely to make matters worse in Ferguson by combining the back-handed exoneration of Darren Wilson with the unstinting condemnation of the City of Ferguson.

Let’s start with the DOJ report that exonerated Wilson. The federal prosecutors ran an exhaustive review of all the physical, forensic, and testimonial evidence in the case. It is necessary to state its final conclusion in full: “Darren Wilson’s actions do not constitute prosecutable violations under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute, 18 U.S.C. § 242, which prohibits uses of deadly force that are ‘objectively unreasonable,’ as defined by the United States Supreme Court. The evidence, when viewed as a whole, does not support the conclusion that Wilson’s uses of deadly force were “objectively unreasonable” under the Supreme Court’s definition. Accordingly, under the governing federal law and relevant standards set forth in the USAM [United States Attorneys’ Manual], it is not appropriate to present this matter to a federal grand jury for indictment, and it should therefore be closed without prosecution.”

The legal conclusion is surely correct, but the tone of the report’s findings are slanted against Wilson. It is not just the case that there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution. It is that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence supports that Wilson’s conduct was fully justified. During the initial encounter, Brown had tried to wrest Wilson’s gun from him by reaching into Wilson’s Chevy Tahoe SUV. Wilson’s story was corroborated, to quote the report, “by bruising on Wilson’s jaw and scratches on his neck, the presence of Brown’s DNA on Wilson’s collar, shirt, and pants, and Wilson’s DNA on Brown’s palm.” Later on, the evidence also showed that Brown was running toward Wilson at the time Wilson fired the fatal shots, not knowing whether Brown was armed or not. The incident was far clearer than the oft-ticklish situations in which the courts have to decide whether a police officer used excessive force against a person who was resisting arrest, as with the controversial grand jury decision not to indict any police officer for the killing of Eric Garner.

What the DOJ now has to do is to acknowledge that the killing of Michael Brown was a justifiable homicide. It must abandon its contrived legalisms and defend Wilson, by condemning unequivocally the entire misguided campaign against him, which resulted in threats against his life and forced his resignation from the police force. Eric Holder owes Wilson an apology for the unnecessary anguish that Wilson has suffered. As the Attorney General for all Americans, he must tell the protestors once and for all that their campaign has been thoroughly misguided from start to finish, and that their continued protests should stop in the interests of civic peace and racial harmony. In light of the past vilification of Wilson, it is not enough for the DOJ to publish the report, and not trumpet its conclusions. It is necessary to put that report front and center in the public debate so that everyone now understands that Wilson behaved properly throughout the entire incident.

The situation is made worse with the publication of the second DOJ report which offers a top-to-bottom condemnation of Ferguson’s criminal justice system. This report was clearly prompted by the belief that Wilson’s killing of Michael Brown was the result of structural problems in Ferguson. But why pick on Ferguson after Wilson was exonerated? It would be one thing to argue that the illegal killing of Michael Brown stemmed from a corrupt and racist culture inside that department. But once it is established that Wilson was fully justified in acting as he did, it is impossible to explain how the culture and norms of the police could have contributed to any illegal act. Indeed, the only plausible inference cuts the opposite way. The ability of Wilson to handle himself well under extreme pressure reflects approvingly on his conduct and on the ethos of the Ferguson Police Department.

In this case, however, the DOJ was determined to make a big deal out of the various misdeeds of the Department. In so doing, it set back race relations in the United States by sending out the unmistakable message that while the DOJ could not get Wilson, it could surely get the city for which he had worked. The Ferguson report gets off on the wrong foot by leading with the claim that “Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs.” That basic orientation, the report continues, leads the police to concentrate on collecting revenue from traffic offenses in order to fill any hole in the Ferguson budget left by a shortfall in sales tax collection. It then further chides the city for sending out arrest warrants for individual ticket holders to meet court dates and to pay for their offenses.

At this point, the key question is whether Ferguson is alone in its practices, or if there are other cities that do the same thing. Given the financial pressures on all cities, Ferguson does not stand alone. If it acts in violation of the public trust, then so do all other cities. Why then pick out Ferguson for special condemnation? It is well known that various form of asset forfeiture are common across the United States. The practices are condemned on all sides of the political spectrum. The liberal American Civil Liberties, for example, begins its Blog of Rights on the subject of Asset Forfeiture Abuse, by noting: “Across the country, law enforcement agents stop motorists—predominantly people of color—and seize the money in their possession simply by asserting that they believe the money is connected to some illegal activity, even without ever pursuing criminal charges. Under federal law and the laws of most states, they are entitled to keep the money they seize, which goes to fill police department coffers, pay salaries, buy new equipment, and fund other perks for the officers.”

The libertarian Institute for Justice harps on the same message in its report “Policing for Profit: The Abuse of Civil Asset Forfeiture.” And most ironically, it was only this January that Holder himself “barred local and state police from using federal law to seize cash, cars and other property without evidence that a crime occurred.” Any balanced report on the situation in Ferguson should ask whether the city is worse off than other state and local governments. Yet nothing suggests that it is, let alone that some culture of revenue collection leads to the improper use of deadly force.

The DOJ report is even odder for its suggestion that it is improper for Ferguson, or any other city, to issue arrest warrants for those who do not pay their fines. Clearly, the entire system will fall apart if parties who receive tickets for traffic violations ignore them with impunity. Some of these tickets at least are given for offenses that do have an adverse impact on public safety, so it seems absurd to think that it is improper to demand their collection. No other state or local government should yield to that practice, so why should Ferguson?

The evidence is no better when the DOJ resorts to statistical evidence to show that the police force has behaved in an improper way because “African Americans experience disparate impact in nearly every aspect of Ferguson’s law enforcement system. Despite making up 67% of the population, African Americans accounted for 85% of FPD’s traffic stops, 90% of FPD’s citations, and 93% of FPD’s arrests from 2012 to 2014.”

The point here represents a gross abuse of statistical evidence for two reasons. First, the disparity in arrests for various offenses ignores one question that matters: did African Americans commit these various offenses at a higher rate than the rest of the population? If they did, then the evidence is perfectly consistent with even-handed enforcement. Second, the report gives no information about the arrest rates in other communities. As John Lott has noted, “The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 2011 Police-Public Contact Survey indicates that, nationwide, blacks were 31 percent more likely than whites to be pulled over for a traffic stop.” If so, then the Ferguson numbers are consistent with national norms, and thus do not show any distinctive form of racial bias.

Finally, the DOJ report points to the presence of some emails from police officials that “stereotype” African Americans. But here, again, it is important to note that isolated emails from various officials, however reprehensible in and of themselves, do not indicate any pervasive forms of misbehavior that suffices to indict an entire police force. Nor is there any evidence that these offensive emails sent between 2008 and 2011 indicate present abuse that could have contributed to poor police practices.

The two DOJ reports do not cohere. The first shows that Wilson’s use of force against Michael Brown was fully justified. The second uses that incident to launch a scathing attack against Ferguson, leading to the resignation of its key officials for conduct that looks on balance to be no better or worse than that in other cities around the country. The serious consequence of the second high-profile report is to keep alive the image that racial injustice is alive and well in the United States. What the report fails to understand is that it is as dangerous to exaggerate the risk of racial injustice as it is to ignore it. In a sad sense, the overheated DOJ report contributes to the inflamed atmosphere that led to the most recent shootings in Ferguson.

It Was A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood—For A Manhunt,"What a glorious spring day! I was unaware of the local news before going out on my morning walk near my house in suburban Fairfax County, Virginia. In the back of my mind, Mr. Rogers was singing a pleasantly annoying version of “It’s a beautiful day in this neighborhood,” when all of a sudden a helicopter started circling pretty much right over my house. Then a police car sped by. And another. And another.

I asked some sidewalk construction workers on my path: “What’s going on?” They told me: “You better just go home.” An escaped and armed prison inmate was thought to be on the loose in the neighborhood. Suddenly, around the corner about ten unmarked vehicles of various makes—some with blue strobes flashing—sped by in quick succession.

As I turned the corner to my street, I saw various police vehicles lined up directly across from my house. Armed men from a SWAT team blocked off the street and shooed me away. “Get back!”

I walked briskly away from the action—and my street—as a K-9 police team hustled in my direction.

I may be a writer. But I’m not one of those Christiane Amanpour-action-hungry journalists. Let’s just say I have the proclivity to avoid getting caught in any unpleasant crossfire if I see a bunch of intense men with automatic weapons out.

Angels Amid a Manhunt

A neighbor I had never met before had been in her driveway waiting for a cab before police told her to get indoors. She waved me towards her so I could take shelter, too.

My neighbor waved me towards her so I could take shelter, too.

I called my husband, who was at work, while she made her own calls. After about 15 minutes, things seemed a tad quieter, and it looked from the corner like the street was re-opened. My angel neighbor drove me the half block home, but the street was still filled with heavily armed police and vehicles and a TV news van. We took in the sight with awe. The helicopter continued circling above.

She dropped me off as I thanked her profusely and hopped inside.

In a mundane moment in the aftermath, I wondered: How could I not have gotten a photo of the action by my house? Not even one personal souvenir of the scene with the news, trooper, police, and SWAT vehicles? I used to earn so many eye rolls from family and friends for my obsession with documenting every experience in life from every angle.

It’s amazing how a little adrenaline can put the kibosh on such things.

Self-Examination in Our Personal 9/11 Moments

It’s been several hours since the inmate was taken into custody, several miles away. Thank God, the manhunt ended with no injuries. I’m peering out of the window at the serenity of my street and its “return to normalcy.” And I realize, yet again, that normalcy is always an illusion that can be punctured at any moment.

We feel thankful, then tend to go straight back to our illusions of normalcy.

We all have our share of these “personal 9/11 witness moments”—our close calls and near misses, or, like my experience today, a little excitement that at the time felt like a possible brush with death. It could be other types of crises that mercifully pass—for example, getting a reassuring test result at the doctor’s office or finding a lost child.

Unfortunately, amnesia usually sets in shortly after these moments of relief. We feel thankful, then tend to go straight back to our illusions of normalcy. Back to our little ambitions, squabbles, and diversions. Back to searching for the proverbial sand in which to sink our collective heads.

Just consider how our nation seems to have pretty much forgotten the existential war 9/11 triggered. Our leadership barely blinked an eye recently when ISIS militants rounded up and summarily beheaded 21 Christians on the shores of Tripoli. Instead, the masses increasingly turn their attention to the diversions of pop culture idols and demagogues, obeying their every command, whether it be to organize a protest against upscale fashion designers for saying something someone doesn’t like, or to boycott a state like Indiana for allowing its residents to live out a faith some people don’t like.

Crystallizing Moments Should Breed Crystallized Questions

When conflict comes to our doorstep, it’s a great moment to reflect on questions that are not only practical, but also spiritual. I came up with a couple in light of this latest experience.

When conflict comes to our doorstep, it’s a great moment to reflect on questions that are not only practical, but also spiritual.

First, the practical questions. Once indoors, the first such question I asked myself, considering reports of a violent and armed convict on the loose nearby, was this one: “What about personal security?” Well, yeah. I mean if someone armed and dangerous breaks into your house, the police generally can’t do anything before you can.

This question takes even greater urgency when we look at the mob mentality of those in Indiana who are essentially protesting the First Amendment. As governors cave to the “perceptions” of these organized packs, one can only wonder if in the future we’re more likely to face angry mobs than lone gunmen. Could governments—backed up by a cultish following of citizens who join in trendy rallies to call for boycotting First Amendment rights—end up consolidating so much power that they could freely persecute those who express their principles and faith? This is a fair and sober question, considering the climate. Sadly, it also clarifies that only the Second Amendment can protect the First.

Who Is My Neighbor?

Next, the more spiritual question: Who is my neighbor? Perhaps this doesn’t work for a lot of folks who cling to the sentiment now so freely expressed in opposition to religious freedom and to traditional religion. But it’s a critical question today. This is the question asked of Christ in the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which He urged us to love our neighbor, to show mercy to others.

Perhaps most importantly of all, my neighbor is the escaped inmate.

My neighbor is not only my literal neighbor who offered me shelter at a time of some anxiety. My neighbor was also the guy on the construction crew who informed me of the situation and advised me to head home. And the SWAT team guy shooing me to a safer place. We have a host of neighbors around us—individuals whose paths cross ours every day, for whatever reason.

But, perhaps most importantly of all, my neighbor is the escaped inmate. Unfortunately, if I had had a gun, I would have felt compelled to shoot anyone armed who suddenly and violently entered my home at such a moment. This hypothetical scenario upsets me intensely.

What Happens When We Isolate People from Meaning

It upsets me because I realize that the prisoner did not arrive at his situation in life through wholeness. He could have only gotten there through brokenness, just the way anyone else gets to that place. It doesn’t happen to people whose sense of worth from childhood was nurtured in a secure home where they learn love and goodwill. No, it happens through broken homes, fatherlessness, broken families, and through the perceived absence of any church or sanctuary where people are free to seek and express what they know to be real Truth.

Without such places of hope, where people can come together and try to make sense of the world and their place in it, there is despair.

Without such places of hope, where people can come together and try to make sense of the world and their place in it, there is despair. If you then take away civil society, which gives us the freedom to express our joy and witness our faith with others, you multiply that despair in a society.

These failures comprise the crumbled foundation upon which broken communities, broken schools, and broken institutions are built. All are incapable of respecting the dignity of the individual and the freedom of individual expression that is necessary for pursuing real happiness. Loneliness and isolation thrive in these cold places—the perfect climate for an individual to lose his way so dramatically, and for a cult mindset among the many to take hold and help erase individuals’ dignity and worth by erasing individual rights. Thus we sow a lot of discord and misery, often in the name of “peace.”

My neighbor can only be an individual. My neighbor is decidedly not the State, and my neighbor is not a cult. But my neighbor is even the conformist who shouts down religious freedom laws as a pawn of the centralized state, because I know that, somewhere along the way, he or she took refuge in groupthink through a failure of love and mercy. We need to learn anew the best ways to get to know our neighbors as individuals and be free to share both love and truth with them.

That’s what I re-learned today from the helicopters, SWAT teams, and neighbors. In that sense, it was a beautiful day in the neighborhood.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/04/07/it-was-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-for-a-manhunt/,2015-04-07
Maryland Police Detain Kids For Walking Three Blocks To The Park,"Lay down your arms. The so-called Mommy Wars are over, and the helicopter parents have won.

Last Sunday afternoon, three Montgomery County police squad cars picked up Rafi and Dvora Meitiv, who are 10 and 6 years old, respectively. Why? Because “a neighbor apparently saw the children walking alone [Sunday] evening and called 911. A local television station reported the children were walking about a third of a mile from home at the time.”

According to the Meitivs, what followed was Kafkaesque:

The police never called [the parents] even though the police had all their contact information. Nor did they allow Rafi and Dvora to call their parents. The Meitiv children were confined to the back of a police car for almost three hours without any explanation of why they were being detained. The Meitiv children were then transported to the Montgomery County Crisis Center for further detention. During this entire time, the children had no access to food and only limited access to the restroom. After a series of delays . . . CPS did not release the children to [their parents] until 10:30 P.M. . . . on a school night.

The Meitiv parents, who knew where their children were, are free-range parents trying to teach independence. However, the Montgomery County Police and Maryland’s Child Protective Services seemingly consider free-range parenting a crime, or at least tantamount to child endangerment.

Hover Near Your Kids Or Else

While I don’t identify as a free-range parent, I find the Meitivs’ story chilling, having lived our own milder version of it. Last summer, after our second daughter was born, I was frequently home alone with both girls. There were times we intended to head to the playground, but the baby suddenly needed to nurse. The preschooler would grow antsy with the delay, so we settled into an arrangement where she’d stand at our front door greeting neighbors as they passed our apartment, while I sat about 20 feet away feeding the baby. Mind you, our hallway is sparsely populated during the day; it’s mostly a few retired residents, and our neighborhood is remarkably safe.

It is incredibly troubling that anonymous strangers can so freely interfere with the choices parents make about how to best raise their own children.

Still, some neighbors disapproved. The building management informed me they had received complaints, and insisted that an adult stand beside our older daughter at all times. We’ve complied, but the whole situation has hurt relationships with our neighbors.

It is incredibly troubling that anonymous strangers can so freely interfere with the choices parents make about how to best raise their own children. There used to be room for debate about the best way to parent and an allowance that no two parents or children are identical, necessitating plenty of parenting approaches. However, as the Meitivs’ situation demonstrates, Maryland Child Protective Services has cut off that public conversation.

Guilty Until Proven Innocent

Nothing extinguishes an open debate like the government’s heavy hand. And nothing is more terrifying for an individual parent than CPS suddenly showing interest in your actions, because unlike American courts, CPS appears to operate on a guilty-until-proven-innocent model.

CPS decides whether a parent is abusing his or her child, and their staff decides what constitutes abuse.

CPS decides whether a parent is abusing his or her child, and their staff decides what constitutes abuse. In this case, it’s not verbal or physical trauma, but rather allowing children to walk three blocks to a playground without adult supervision. That is an expansive definition.

According to USA Today, “Maryland law prohibits children younger than age 8 from being unattended in a dwelling or car but makes no reference to outdoors. A person must be at least 13 years old to supervise a child younger than 8.”

But how many Maryland parents know about this non-intuitive law, and does enforcing it like this really keep kids safe? I’m a parenting writer married to a lawyer, and this is the first I’ve heard about it. Neighboring Washington DC, by contrast, claims to consider each case individually.

Some will ask whether the Meitivs were trying to prove a point. They were certainly on CPS’ radar screen after an earlier run-in, but I don’t believe they were looking to provoke faceless bureaucrats. They seem like parents who just wanted to be left alone to raise confident, self-reliant kids.

For the sake of families everywhere—and our nation’s future—that’s something we should all want. The right to raise our children as we think best should appeal to all parents, regardless of parenting philosophy. If want to maintain that right, now is the time for parents to start encouraging CPS to use its limited resources to protect children who really need it.

Baltimore And The Broken Windows Fallacy,"Three days after 9/11, Krugtron the Invincible wrote the most Paul Krugman post ever discussing the potential benefits, primarily economic, of the terror attacks. In the wake of the destruction in Maryland, I’m now eagerly awaiting his column praising all the economic stimulus going on in Baltimore this week. Krugtron, wholly rapt by the fallacy of the broken window, is sure not to disappoint on this front. It’s his thing.

The fallacy of the broken window was introduced by Frenchman Frédéric Bastiat in “That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen” in 1850. The parable, titled simply “The Broken Window,” was a short tale dealing with opportunity cost, one of Bastiat’s focal points. In the parable, shopkeeper James B. discovers his window is broken and must be replaced, thereby keeping the window glazier in business. Many saw this is as a net good. Window glaziers need work, too.

What Bastiat highlighted was that the six francs James B. spent repairing his window—that which is seen—does not account for the other ways that James B. might have spent those six francs—that which is unseen. It’s true that the glazier does not profit from James B.’s shoe purchase, his preferred use of his six francs, but James B. certainly enjoys having both new shoes and a window.

Bastiat pointed out that this combination—getting new shoes and keeping his window—was preferable to giving the window glazier six francs. In Bastiat’s own words, aimed at trade protectionists, “What will you say, Monsieur Industriel—what will you say, disciples of good M. F. Chamans, who has calculated with so much precision how much trade would gain by the burning of Paris, from the number of houses it would be necessary to rebuild?”

Today we aren’t discussing the burning of Paris, but of Baltimore. The chaos in the city, not so much in the news on Saturday because of more pressing concerns, finally made its way to the wider populace on Monday when the riots and looting exploded. As of Tuesday, Baltimore had calmed and the reports about the number of broken windows began to roll in.

How the Baltimore Riots Started

Before we get to Bastiat and Baltimore, we have to examine where it all began. David Graham, writing at The Atlantic, covers the story of Freddie Gray in detail (at least, as much detail as is available). Gray was arrested on April 12 for unknown reasons. He died on April 19 from spinal injuries. Although struggling to walk when arrested, likely from a leg injury sustained during a chase, the injuries that killed him occurred while in police custody. Experts compared them to those that occur during a major car crash.

Baltimore police seem to employ an unsanctioned technique known as the ‘rough ride.’

This wasn’t the first time an individual came out of a Baltimore police van in much worse shape than he or she went in. Baltimore police seem to employ an unsanctioned technique known as the “rough ride,” and the city has paid multiple settlements to people who suffered spinal injuries while in police custody.

As such, we have a death very similar to those of Eric Garner and Walter Scott—a black man confronted for a trivial reason and who ended up losing his life to out-of-control police officers. The anger here is extremely justified.

From Protest to Fire

The anger moved above the surface over the weekend. It started on Saturday with a protest march. However, the situation quickly escalated into destruction with 34 people being arrested on that first night. The violence necessitated a message asking attendees of an Orioles game to remain in the stadium. Unfortunately, tension remained high through Sunday and Monday. By Tuesday, 15 buildings and 144 cars had been set on fire and 233 people arrested.

That’s a lot of broken windows, especially at this under-construction senior center that was to house approximately 60 low-income seniors and a community center. So while the anger about police behavior may be justified, the way people expressed it is not. Seriously, people. Stop arguing that burning and looting are understandable. Unless you want to offer up your address so people can take the show on the road.

The Economic Case against Riots

As it stands, the residents of Baltimore will not benefit from these riots. Gray’s family has vocally condemned the riots, with his mother saying, “Don’t tear up the whole city just for him. That’s wrong.” Maybe she should have tried quoting Bastiat. For though the flames are currently extinguished, Baltimore is facing long-term economic consequences as a result of the riots.

Joe Carter points out a number of significant challenges Baltimore residents face as a result of the riots:

In 2004, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) published two papers that examined the effect of the riots in the 1960s and early 1970s. From 1964 to 1971, as many as 700 riots erupted in cities across America. The large numbers of injuries, deaths, property damage that occurred in predominantly black neighborhoods caused considerable short-term damage on the communities. But the impact over the long run (from 1960 to 1980) was even more severe.

Later, in the same article, Carter breaks another pane in the broken window fallacy:

They find that the riots significantly depressed the median value of black-owned property between 1960 and 1970, with little or no rebound in the 1970s. The baseline estimates for severe-riot cities relative to small-or-no-riot cities range from approximately 14 to 20 percent for black-owned properties, and from 6 to 10 percent for all central-city residential properties. Household-level data for the 1970s indicate that the racial gap in property values widened substantially in riot-afflicted cities relative to others.

So Many Broken Windows

Piles of broken glass. Stores damaged and looted. A brick thrown through the window of a music store. Police cars and a CVS Pharmacy set ablaze. Gang members uniting to guard black-owned businesses in an attempt to stop the destruction.

Money that may have been spent on expanding, new employees, or a new pair of shoes will now go to windows, doors, and ceilings.

As of writing, rioting has been replaced by restoration. Volunteers are working to clean the damages and return a sense of normalcy to the city. They’re not being paid six francs.

No, Baltimore will reel from the past few days for years to come. Some businesses will never reopen. Some will take time. Money that may have been spent on expanding, new employees, or a new pair of shoes will now go to windows, doors, and ceilings. Remember our friend, opportunity cost? For Baltimore, opportunity costs are going to be steep.

In Krugman’s post-9/11 piece, he stated, “First, the driving force behind the economic slowdown has been a plunge in business investment. Now, all of a sudden, we need some new office buildings.” Baltimore will definitely need some new buildings. One problem is that its economy was actually ahead of the national average. It wasn’t in need of new buildings, outside of that destroyed senior center. The bigger problem is that the destruction of property doesn’t function as Shiva the Destroyer, razing neighborhoods so that the world can be made anew. No, broken windows are just broken windows; “destruction cannot be the source of prosperity.”

The Answer to Tragedy Isn’t Tragedy

Gray’s death is a tragedy. The events of the past few days, though equally senseless, are not as tragic. A building is not the same as a life. However, those whose response to tragedy was to burn and loot the businesses of their neighbors, while giving some new work to window glaziers, will not solve anything. For, as Bastiat said, “Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.”

The men charged with enforcing the law violated their end of the contract. But that does not negate what predated the contract, it makes it imperative to renew the contract and burn down those who use it as an excuse to ignore those initial conditions. Buildings will be restored, businesses re-opened. They will do so not because rioters held life, liberty, and property hostage, because they destroyed it. They will move on in spite of it, but they’ll be forced to do so at a slower pace.

Why Ta-Nehisi Coates Is Wrong About The Baltimore Riots,"Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an article that does not quite praise the Baltimore riots, but cannot quite find a way to condemn them. It makes a compelling case for why people are angry. It discusses all of the terrible things the Baltimore police have done. And then it sort of falls apart.

It seems to say that one cannot condemn the actions by the Baltimore police, then condemn the rioters for their destructive and misguided actions and advocate for non-violent protests, because this would be “the right answer to the wrong question” and hypocritical. But the riots raise a simple question: should one riot in response to the Baltimore police’s actions and other societal problems and, if a riot occurs, should one condemn it? It should yield simple answers: one should not riot, and, yes, we should condemn violence.

Coates would rather not address these questions, but keep the focus on the wrongs those in power have done. But the question of when violence can be an appropriate political tactic is a serious question people should not ignore. And it has been eloquently addressed by various people throughout American history, from the founding fathers to Martin Luther King Jr to Malcolm X.

Difficult questions exist about the moral righteousness of violence, how oppressed or locked out of the political system the oppressed are, whether change within the system is possible, and whether violence is an effective tactic for those seeking redress. One reason I think Coates wants to avoid this debate, and these questions, is because the case for violence in Baltimore is so weak.

Try Thinking It Through Next Time

Coates recognizes that these riots are not wise, and that pleas for non-violence by politicians are well intended, then spends most of the article describing various incidents of police brutality, making his “case against the Baltimore police, and the society that superintends them.”

One can be a hypocrite and still be right.

Then what, exactly, is Coates saying? That riots cannot be condemned until their causes are addressed? He gives no guidance about how much they need to be addressed before it’s time to address rioting. Do we need to talk more? Do we need to institute certain programs or reforms—and, if so, which ones? Do we have to wait until they work?

Perhaps Coates is saying that because people in power can be hypocrites we should not listen? Yet one can be a hypocrite and still be right. And it is not just those in power who recognize the harm these riots are doing and call for peace. Freddie Gray’s family, among others, have also called for peace. I hope Coates would not accuse them of answering the wrong question. They, like many others not “in power,” rightly anticipate the negative consequences of violence.

Why Rioting Deserves Condemnation

We should not forget that the people who will suffer the most from this rioting will be the poor and minority citizens of Baltimore. This rioting will do nothing but harm the very people rioting. It will be their jobs that will disappear, their property values that plummet, their schools that worsen, their businesses and the businesses that serve them that suffer, and their neighborhoods that will be even more unsafe.

This rioting will do nothing but harm the very people rioting.

The wealthy will be fine, as they have insurance and those who live in the city can leave. One can look at the 1968 riots to see their negative effects on inner-city neighborhoods. In some cases, those cities have yet to recover, almost 50 years later. The community’s relationship with the police will certainly deteriorate further, making it more difficult to fight the crime that harms poor neighborhoods, and to repair an already broken relationship.

The rioting can also, and should be, condemned for moral reasons. Violence as a response to perceived and actual past wrongs is rarely justified, and this is not one of those rare cases.

Some might respond, as Coates seems to, by saying this focuses on the wrong thing—the behavior of the rioters rather than the behavior of the police and those in power. Yet one can accept everything he says about society being racist and the police being out of control, and still think that rioting has terrible consequences and should be condemned and discouraged. One can accept that calls for non-violence from politicians may be hypocritical, and yet still be correct. One can understand the causes of a riot, and still find they do not justify violence, will harm the cause of those rioting, and should be condemned for moral reasons, as well as for their bad consequences. Just because one group identified as privileged has committed wrongs, does not mean people should encourage any action by the less privileged.

Are Riots Predetermined?

Coates then tries to compare rioting to a forest fire, as if it simply just occurs, but then promptly undermines his flawed analogy. He immediately says the riots have a point, and that point is disrespect. Forest fires generally don’t have points, but of course rioting often has purposes. Again, I struggle to see Coates’s point. One can accept that showing disrespect to hypocrites in power is the purpose of the riots, and still condemn the riots on moral and practical grounds.

The Baltimore police should be condemned, and should change their behavior. Just like the rioters.

Perhaps Coates believes the riots are the result of larger social forces and have just popped into existence, like a forest fire. Of course, if one takes this deterministic view, the same (deeply flawed) argument would apply to the Baltimore police. They just acted based on larger social forces, and since they lacked agency we cannot condemn them. Of course, this argument would be rightly dismissed. Almost everyone (including Coates) has been condemning the Baltimore police. They should be condemned, and should change their behavior. Just like the rioters.

The most troubling words come in the final paragraph. Coates argues that calls for nonviolence by those engaging in violence are hypocritical and a ruse. He compares the situation to a “war with the aggressor calling time out.” Does this mean the citizens of Baltimore are in a war with the police? Would we be asking the wrong question if police officers were shot and killed as part of all this, and we tried to condemn those actions as morally wrong? Would it all just be part of an expression of disrespect that we oppressors should not condemn, lest we fail to be deemed lacking understanding or addressing the “real problems?” His article raises a lot of these questions and provides very few satisfactory answers.

Facts Are Dead; Long Live Insanity,"Maryland State Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced this week that second-degree murder was among the charges being brought against the six police officers involved in the arrest of Freddie Gray, who later died as a result of injuries sustained while in custody on April 12.

Legal experts say it will be extremely difficult for Mosby to get a guilty verdict on such steep charges, given that the currently known facts of the case don’t appear to bear the weight of such a heavy charge.

But if Mosby’s words are any indication of how the case will proceed, facts will likely take a back seat to political motivations and calls for racial justice. What has been, for the most part, a methodical and evidence-driven justice system may now be shifting to one driven by social unrest and political ambition—neither of which are beholden to concrete realities.

Facts are now irrelevant. They tend to get in the way of progress. Fiction, or what is more fashionably called “the narrative,” is the foundation for our great society—and what a more vibrant, tolerant, positive society it is! Or conversely, what a tragic, hellish, frightful world we inhabit. They are both equally valid perspectives, depending on our social and political goals.

I’ll tell the story, since we are so enamored of narratives of late, of how facts passed away into the dark void of historical insignificance.

It’s hard to settle on a starting point for when the pertinence of facts to the important issues of our lives began to degrade, but for the sake of brevity we will start in the more recent past, where our memories can corroborate.

Michael Brown: The Victim

Freddie Gray is only the latest in a string of police encounters colored along racial lines, the most recently infamous of which occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014. Michael Brown was fatally shot by Officer Darren Wilson, but the specifics of the event beyond that brief description diverged quickly based on witness testimony and pre-existing narratives on race and police relations in the United States.

The specifics of the event diverged quickly based on witness testimony and pre-existing narratives on race and police relations in the United States.

A chief cause of that divergence was the testimony from Brown’s companion at the time of the shooting, Dorian Johnson, who reported that Brown, with his hands up, had told Wilson, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting.” But that never happened, nor did Brown utter any variation thereof, according to any credible witnesses of his shooting death.

Through social media and a sensationalizing press, that quote from Johnson quickly morphed into “hands up, don’t shoot.” Thousands of angry protesters took to the streets, from Ferguson to Los Angeles to Seattle, with #handsupdontshoot emblazoned on their chests and their cardboard signs. Protesters marched well into the holiday season, with an array of slogans ranging from “black lives matter” to “no racist police” to “justice for Trayvon,” but “hands up don’t shoot” has always been prominent among them.

The meme pervaded even the most scrutinized of institutions, as five National Football League players from the St. Louis Rams, knowing hundreds of reporters watch them for some juicy word or gesture to pick apart on the commentary circuit, walked onto the field in a November game against the Raiders in the symbolic pose of surrender, long after “hands up don’t shoot” was discredited.

Where they sheltered from the more accurate and credible reports that came out in the months after the shooting? Were they aware of them, but simply denied they were true? Or did they realize the meme was built on a false testimony, but used it to make a broader statement about police and race relations anyway? Put simply, did the facts matter, or were they overwhelmed by the narrative, perhaps even avoided?

Did they realize the meme was built on a false testimony, but used it to make a broader statement about police and race relations anyway?

The art and music industries, having an even greater affinity for catchy slogans based on current events, produced multiple works based off “hands up, don’t shoot.” Rapper Queen McElrath, inspired by the events in Ferguson, wrote the song “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” creating a music video with high-school students in which the rapper proclaims, “I am Trayvon I am Mike Brown,” before peers launched into the chorus repetition of “hands up, don’t shoot.”

Similarly, an Oscars rap performance by Common and John Legend featured the lyrics, “Resistance is us…that’s why Rosa sat on the bus, that’s why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up.” This was in February, months after Johnson was thoroughly discredited.

This isn’t the first time the black community has shown intellectual resilience to evidence emerging after people have already formed and promulgated opinions on an issue. Despite all the evidence, a full 40 percent of blacks still believe O.J. Simpson isn’t guilty.

The University of Virginia ‘Rape Story’

The source of the narrative totally made this story up, but that’s not why it’s disturbing. It’s not even the trauma that supposedly unfolded one night in the Greek system. It’s how the story spun itself into such an irresistibly sensational publication that Rolling Stone just couldn’t wait to catapult into the national discourse on “campus rape culture.” They allowed that story to spin uninhibited by corroborating statements, or even verification that the man who allegedly orchestrated the whole gang rape was a real person.

Gillibrand, along with many others, is chiefly concerned with defending and promulgating the narrative, even when the narrative and the truth are at odds.

What is more, the author of that story, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the instigator of tremendous conflict on the University of Virginia campus and the outright shaming of the Phi Kappa Psi, is still working at Rolling Stone after an entire narrative, which floated for months on the currents of liberal media, a flashing beacon bobbing on the waves of rape-culture dialogue, finally popped in a fantastic display of the fragility of modern journalistic narratives.

But the narrative continues to unfold, despite catching on a few snags of controversy. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York essentially waved off the Charlottesville police’s conclusions that they were “unable to verify the sexual assault,” saying that, “Victim blaming or shining the spotlight on her (the female that alleged the rape) for coming forward is not the right approach.”

“It’s not about any one case or any one investigation. It’s about a very serious problem that is taking place across campuses across the country,” she stated.

In other words, whether the accuser’s statements hold any truth at all is rather unimportant. Gillibrand, along with many others, is chiefly concerned with defending and promulgating the narrative, even when the narrative and the truth are at odds.

Bowe Bergdahl: The Hero

In the midst of a deep rooted scandal in the Veterans Affairs in May 2014, the Obama administration initiated the trade of five Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay for the return of U.S. Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who was believed to have been held by the Taliban for five years. Bergdahl was warmly received home with a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, in which President Obama asserted that “the United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.”

If you had isolated yourself from outside media and only observed the actions and language of the administration, you would think Bergdahl was a true American hero who had made great sacrifices for his country.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice stated in an interview with CNN after the trade that Bergdahl had “served with honor and distinction.” The Obama portrayed Bergdahl, almost flawlessly, as a hero finally coming home after five years as a hapless victim, received by his country with celebration and open arms. Their opinion of the trade as a good and just action was unwavering. If you had isolated yourself from outside media and only observed the actions and language of the administration, you would think Bergdahl was a true American hero who had made great sacrifices for his country.

In March 2015, Bergdahl was charged with one count of desertion and another count of misbehavior, yet members of Bergdahl’s platoon had called him a deserter long before charges were brought. A 2010 Pentagon investigation report concluded that “incontrovertible evidence” had been found that Bergdahl had willfully abandoned his post, consequently landing himself in Taliban captivity.

He was “ashamed to be an american,” Bergdhal had written in correspondence to his parents, and, “The horror that is america is disgusting.”

Two very different narratives have run counter to each other with near equal velocity. One includes Bergdahl’s own actions, as supported by the evidence, as a factor in not only his circumstance as a captive, but his relative worth to other soldiers who had risked their lives to recover him, and the threat posed by the Taliban leaders we traded for him. The other narrative was characterized by a conspicuous lack of details, the vacuum in which grew a very different version of events.

Climate Change: The Deniers

As Greg Jones wrote for The Federalist, climate-change experts are grasping for an explanation for the “pause” in global warming. Man-made calamity looms greater than ever, they say, despite only one-third of 1 degree Celsius warming since 1979, and despite the upward trend in greenhouse-gas emissions that leaves the rate of global warming lagging far behind.

Data that is repeatedly cherry-picked and framed to instead support your theory and flesh out a pre-existing narrative is not science at all.

The Washington Post published an article titled “The global warming slowdown is real — but that’s no reason to question climate science.” In fact, according to Scientific American, experts say that once we get over the “speedbump,” the earth will warm even faster!

Jones frames the statements of the climate change through the five stages of grief. The entire process is a struggle against the evidence, but global warming enthusiasts are not mourning a death. Instead they mourn a crisis that was not birthed when expected, and anxiously anticipate its delivery. They are like cult members who watch a rapture date come and pass, yet hang on every word of their leader’s next prediction.

Why the anticipation? When evidence mounts against one’s theory, an analyst following the scientific method would be forced not only to concede his theory may not be as plausible as initially thought, but to purposely seek out more evidence to try to prove his initial theory wrong. That is science. The more data gathered in the attempt to disprove the theory that instead supports it strengthens that theory. Data that is repeatedly cherry-picked and framed to instead support your theory and flesh out a pre-existing narrative is not science at all.

The little green bumper stickers are all the convincing we need to believe in a climate crisis.

But “science” isn’t a body of data painstakingly collected through rigorous scientific method; no longer do narratives simply piggyback off science. Now, science has been consumed by the narrative. It is the narrative. And the narrative, unlike science, must not be questioned.

No longer do we burden ourselves with investigating the basic premise on which an entire infrastructure of policy and technology has been built, with scant proof that a little warming isn’t in fact a good thing. We assume warming is bad, though a little less frostbite could do thousands of square miles of crops some good. No longer do we bother to demonstrate with strong evidence that carbon dioxide is the driving force behind global warming; instead, we take it for granted. Nearly every car and energy supplier commercial you’ve seen over the past several years has bragged about how much they’ve reduced their carbon footprint. The little green bumper stickers are all the convincing we need to believe in a climate crisis.

Fetuses: It’s Goo

Last year, Bill Maher interviewed Sarah Silverman, and she spoke about her pro-abortion activism. “It’s goo that they’re [pro-life protesters] so worried about,” she said, “and then they’re born, and it’s, ‘You’re on your own, slut.’” Silverman doesn’t specify which stage of pregnancy she refers to as goo. One can only conclude that the growth stages of a fetus are so insignificant they all can comfortably fit under that three-letter word, despite the fact that a fetus’ heart begins beating at around five weeks old. By week eight, the eyes are formed. By the twelfth week, a fetus has fingernails.

A fetus is not an extension of a woman’s body, but a separate life, with unique genetic material.

Silverman also voiced one of the pro-choice’ side’s most popular lines, saying she supports women being able to choose “what they do with their own bodies.” But this is not a mere matter of perception; literally speaking, she supports women’s right to choose what they do with someone else’s body. A fetus is not an extension of a woman’s body, but a separate life, with unique genetic material, half from the mother and half from the father.

The broad support on the Left for this “right,” and how enough people seem to buy into this right that FactCheck or Snopes have not debunked it, indicates one or both of two things: that a huge segment of the public cannot dwell on an idea long enough—a mere couple seconds—to realize its obvious logical flaw, or that our public education system has done so poorly as to graduate millions of citizens incapable of distinguishing separate organisms if one occupies space within another.

Yet “what women do with their own bodies” has become, despite the evidence, the go-to slogan for the pro-abortion Left.

The Dangerous Credulity of Anti-Vaxxers

Anti-vaccination is a sticky belief. It catches people from both the Left and the Right, entangling them in a sticky web of Internet memes and pseudo-science sites. It is not a belief from which they can easily extricate themselves, having tossed and turned until its sappy tendrils cover their eyes and ears. Despite all scientifically-grounded evidence and expertise supporting the immense benefits of vaccination and the danger of not vaccinating, anti-vaxxers cling to convictions that coalesced over obscure blog posts and frightening but unsubstantiated claims friends have forwarded them.

Where are the medical studies that say ‘natural immunity’ is more effective than vaccinations?

Some have rightly pointed out that celebrities have given a megaphone to what would otherwise have been steady, but merely annoying, murmurs in cyberspace. Jenny McCarthy, who has no medical education to speak of or any credible scientists backing her up, is leading the attack, with a little help from Oprah’s prominent media platform. Oprah said in 2007 that “she knows what she’s talking about.”

Where is the evidence that vaccines cause autism? Where are the medical studies that say “natural immunity” is more effective than vaccinations? Where are the facts?

There are none in the anti-vaxxer camp; in fact, there is virtually a consensus of the opposite. In the world of vaccine deniers, only unsubstantiated propaganda has captivated enough parents to further the spread of a measles outbreak at Disneyland to 127 cases through parents choices not to vaccinate. In some pockets of California, the vaccination rate is estimated to be as low as 50 percent.

Sadly, there is probably a thread at the bottom of this post decrying vaccines as a horrible irresponsible money-maker of Big Pharma. The callers on talk radio attack hosts for speaking out against the anti-vaxxer myths and irresponsibility. And that is truly disturbing, in a community of readers and listeners that on other issues appreciates the truth instead of collapsing into a popular narrative.

Organic: The Conscientious Consumer

Another popular idea, greatly surpassing anti-vaccination in magnitude, is superiority of organic food over non-organic or “genetically modified” foods. Whole Foods has capitalized on this idea with a vast selection of (pricey) organic items.

Two hundred thirty-seven studies observe that, on average, organic foods are neither safer nor more nutritious than cheaper alternatives.

A recent poll conducted by Reuters found that 68 percent of people under age 35 prefer to buy organic food, and on the whole 55 percent prefer to buy organic. A full 48 percent of those who said they prefer organic gave either avoiding toxins or environmental health as their reason.

But it might very well surprise you to discover that 237 studies observe that, on average, organic foods are neither safer nor more nutritious than cheaper alternatives. Scientists from the University of California-Berkely concluded in another paper that the risks of pesticide residue from natural pesticides (permitted for “organic” agriculture) and synthetic pesticides are about equal. Moreover, they stated that, “low doses of most human exposures the comparative hazards of synthetic pesticide residues are insignificant.”

Perhaps the stickiest myth among the pro-organic crowd is about GMOs (genetically modified organisms). GMOs have been genetically adjusted to produce a better product, such as a redder apple or seedless watermelon. Some have gotten the idea, perhaps in association with anti-MonSanto memes, that GMOs are untested and therefore unsafe. In Washington State, an initiative came on the ballot in 2013 to require labeling all GMO foods sold in the state as such. The health risks GMOs posed were perceived great enough to warrant disclosure to consumers—although if a piece of produce does not have a sticker that says it’s organic, it’s a safe bet that it is a GMO anyway.

Some consumers will pay more than a dollar more for a half gallon of organic milk over conventional milk.

Despite the lack of evidence to support the superiority of organic foods, they are such a big deal that virtually every grocery store with a produce department has a section dedicated to organic fruits and vegetables.

It’s not easy to get Americans to part with their cash, but Big Organic (if you’re into that sort labeling) has done it on a massive scale, and to a significant degree—some consumers will pay more than a dollar more for a half gallon of organic milk over conventional milk. Whole Foods has built an empire largely on the idea that organic food (not just natural food) is better for you, but anyone who’s willing to take a few moments to investigate, the ones who truly care about the facts behind the narrative or the sales pitch, can discover that the “organic” brand is built on hollow assumptions and false premises.

Religious Freedom: The Bigots

In March 2014, the mayor of Seattle announced he would “impose an administration-wide ban on state-funded travel to Indiana.” His decision followed a move by the Indiana legislature to pass a law that Mayor Murray called “disturbing” because he said it would allow business owners to discriminate against members of the LGBT community.

If the news was breaking to you over Twitter or other social media, you might have gotten the impression that Indiana lawmakers had up and decided that gay people were no longer welcome in their state, and that Indiana had been overrun with religious bigots who were just waiting for the government to give them license to discriminate.

However, the text of the law, known as a RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) that the mayor was protesting doesn’t even mention discrimination by private parties, much less expressly grant it. Instead, the law provides that:

A governmental entity may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability. (b) A governmental entity may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if the governmental entity demonstrates that application of the burden to the person: (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.

Gabriel Malor described the law as a “balancing test for litigation,” putting “exercise of religion on one side of the scale and then government interest on the other.” Malor explains the furor over the law as being subject to “informed attributes,” or a “violation of show, don’t tell,” where people impose characteristics onto a subject simply through telling (“the Indiana law is anti-gay!”) without substantiating their claims with the behavior or nature of the subject.

Why the use of literary terms? Journalism has become more a work of fiction loosely based on reality, inspired by reality, rather than an attempt at reflecting it. The more fictional the journalistic work, the more literary tools of analysis, and not standards of accurate reporting, will apply. This is how far away facts have slipped from the supremacy they were once supposed to have held in reportorial sphere.

Malor says that in works of fiction, informed attributes “occur when the author gets lazy.” This may well be true for some journalists, but this phenomenon extends beyond laziness. It is not simply a matter of being too sluggish every once in a while to get off the couch and feed the dog, but rather of letting the dog outside one day and refusing to let it back in, until eventually it wanders off to find a new home or is eaten by the coyotes.

A Nice Story Feels Better than Truth, Right?

When the dog does abandon its former home, you’ve grown so used to not having it around that you won’t even miss it. That is the final stage in the death of facts. We are so comfortable in our fictional world that we lose the sense that something might be missing, that the story we are told doesn’t quite match up with what our eyes and ears observe. We lose first our suspicion, and then our curiosity.

That is how facts die. They languish under the pressures of a narrative that slowly envelops them in a web of modern intellectual diseases—of social justice and emotional reactionism, of incuriousness and gullibility.

Perhaps we are better off without them. Perhaps we will look back on the years of conflict between fact and fiction, and realize that we were right to cast off the burden of truth in exchange for the comfort of a story, to have a camera that captures all of society, that zooms in and out for us, selects the focus, and portrays the protagonists, the antagonists, and the plot for us all to watch together.

We cheer when the hero prevails, laugh with the laugh tracks, shriek at the horrors, and cry at the deaths. The only deaths we do not cry for are the ones we don’t recognize or remember. Facts are chief among the forgotten.

Baltimore’s Real Police Problem: Unions,"The recent unrest in Baltimore has been dominating the headlines. But the real story is less about the particulars of the gruesome death of Freddie Gray and more about the set of policies that have increased the odds of such tragedies happening. These policies cover a broad range of issues, from police practices to public education. But they all bear the mark of progressive thinking, which has reduced the legitimate prospects for advancement and increased the odds of social disruption.

Start with the tough business of law enforcement. No one knows the exact figure, but a decent estimate tells us that there are about 900,000 police officers in the United States. Even in the best-run organizations, it is never possible to secure compliance rates of 100 percent. There are always some rogues. If only one percent of the police officers in this country disregard their basic duties, that is enough to lead to some inexcusable behaviors that can tear—and have torn—a nation apart.

If it is exceedingly difficult to maintain high rates of compliance in well-run organizations, it is even more difficult to secure them in organizations whose structures are far from ideal, as is the case with police departments. As Ross Douthat has written in “Our Police Union Problem,” one of the major problems with the police is that they are heavily unionized. That began in January of 1962, when President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10988, which ushered in a broad expansion of public unionized workers, who had not received collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The 1935 act confined collective bargaining rights to private sector industrial unions.

The reform was praised as a way to give workers in the public sector the same rights as those in the private sector. But the law was flawed for two reasons. First, it established parity in the wrong direction. Put bluntly, the 1935 NLRB was a mistake insofar as it introduced state-protected monopoly unions into competitive markets. The short-term gains for most (but by no means all) union members generated huge costs for everyone else in the system. If the union got its demands, wages went up to monopoly levels, thereby distorting service and product markets. If they did not get their way, strikes and other dislocations would surely follow, with huge uncompensated losses to the firm and to the many individuals and groups who depend on it for vital services.

Second, public unions are, on average, more dangerous than private ones. It is commonly understood that the no civilization can long survive unless the state has a monopoly of power within the jurisdiction. Giving the state the monopoly on power is not ideal, but it is better than having a collection of warring militias and roving gangs that escalate the use of force and trap innocent people in the crossfire. The words “police power” appears nowhere in the United States Constitution, yet it has long been widely recognized that the elusive police power, directed to the protection of health, safety, morals and the general welfare, is an inherent attribute of the sovereign. Its scope, especially on matters of morals, can be vigorously debated. As Chief Justice Waite said in Stone v. Mississippi: “all agree that the legislature cannot bargain away the police power of a state.” It is a regrettable necessity that state sovereignty requires a public monopoly over the use of force. But it is far worse for any fraction of that power to be given to a private party, freed from the standard political and constitutional safeguards designed to hem in the improper use of that power.

Giving the state the monopoly on power is not ideal, but it is better than having a collection of warring militias and roving gangs that escalate the use of force and trap innocent people in the crossfire.

Unions, like other private organizations, march to a different drummer, and thus will use their newfound power to interfere with the proper operation of public forces by reducing their power to hire, train, fire, and discipline the members of their employees. Nearly a century ago, during the Boston police strike of 1919, Calvin Coolidge said bluntly to Samuel Gompers, the then head of the American Federation of Labor: “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.” That observation was made before the ascendancy of progressive politics in the United States.

Job security for individual workers cannot come at the cost of events like those surrounding the death of Freddie Gray, in which the conduct of the police officers involved was deplorable and in all likelihood criminal as well. It is difficult to know whether the prompt indictment of the six officers involved in the case was rash or prudent. Sitting from the outside, it is very hard to second-guess State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby’s decision to bring serious charges against the six officers involved in the incident, three of whom were African-American.

The only system that has ever proved equal to the challenge in cases of this sort is a full and fair trial, in which the defendants are afforded the presumption of innocence that can be only overcome by proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. All too often in criminal cases, the question of guilt in the abstract is more or less a given. The severity of the guilt is determined by the grade of homicide—from first-degree murder to involuntary manslaughter.

The harder questions relate to the public response to the various killings. The extended riots in Ferguson must in retrospect becondemned as a reckless rush to judgment of an innocent man. Its major consequence was to wreck innocent citizens and businesses in a community that had already suffered far too much. The Baltimore riots are every bit as pointless, because they too drag down innocent people for wrongs that random violence can never rectify. It is therefore especially disappointing in the wake of the riots to read the influential black journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates write his polemic “Nonviolence as Compliance” in the Atlantic, with the subtitle: “Officials calling for calm can offer no rational justification for Gray’s death, and so they appeal for order.” This one sentence gets the world upside down.

Of course officials in Baltimore should call for calm, as that is the only way to protect the lives and property of innocent people in Baltimore, the majority of whom (as if this mattered) are African-American. All citizens are entitled to that protection, and if there were ever a case for a color-blind system of justice, the basic operation of the criminal law is it.

Of course, there is no rational justification for Gray’s death, which is why some form of criminal prosecution and departmental discipline are absolute necessities in this case. But it is not as though an appeal to order is misplaced when the police have misbehaved. It is all the more necessary to try to restore matters to an even keel before there are more killings, woundings, firebombings, and general mayhem. What else should these public officials say? That it’s fine to riot no how matter how much it undermines civic institutions?

At this point, we have to face some hard choices on what to do next. To Coates, the answer is all too easy—it is to insist, as he did in a speech at Johns Hopkins, that “The Clock Didn’t Start with the Riots,” which then leads to yet another denunciation of antebellum slavery and Jim Crow. All too true, but irrelevant, for on this view the past has perpetual claims on the future. It is as if the early debts can never be discharged no matter what actions are taken thereafter. The hard questions, therefore, are not about the past. Instead they have to confront what was done in, say, the 50 years since the initial successes of the civil rights movement in the 1960s.

It is not that this nation has not tried its fair measure of targeted interventions to aid minority groups, and it is not as though the system of transfer payments to help the poor has shrunk since that time. But it is the case that the current system is just not working. Recall that three of the officers who are on the dock for Gray’s senseless death are African-American. So inbred, unconscious racism is a weak explanation for their behavior, which is far more likely explained by the sense of privilege that comes from the inability of civic society to subject the police to sensible restrictions. Power, Lord Acton tells us, “tends to corrupt, and absolutely power corrupts absolutely.” That principle applies not only to the great men of whom Lord Acton spoke, but also to public servants of all ages, races and sex, who are insulated from legal oversight by independent actors.

Yet focusing only on the misdeeds of the Baltimore police force misses the depths of the problem. Baltimore is a strongly Democratic city whose experimentation with progressive principles has proved unable to lift people out from poverty. Its labor and taxation policies have led to an exodus of well-to-do citizens, white and black, so that Baltimore’s population has plunged by about a third, from about 940,000 in 1960 to 622,000 in 2013. The question on the table is how to reverse the population decline, which will only come if the city is a decent place for people of all races to live, work, and educate their children.

Yet Baltimore has done little to cultivate the one thing that might bring people back to the inner city—school choice—and based on the leadership in the democratic party on this point, it’s not likely that Baltimore will. President Obama wants to zero out the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, for example, which provides scholarships to about 5,000 students, 95 percent of whom are black. The unions have fiercely opposed the program.

In Baltimore, like in Washington D.C., the government is confronted with a choice between two constituencies: unions and people in need. The tragedy of the modern progressive movement is that it prioritizes the former at the expense of the latter. The people of Baltimore deserve better. They deserve a decent education and a safe place to live.

Why Are Conservatives Soft On Police Brutality?,"Conor Friedersdorf is upset with conservatives. Specifically, he’s infuriated by their blasé attitude towards police brutality. What will it take, he wonders, to persuade them that our justice system is unjust?

Friedersdorf raises some fair questions. Why, for example, are American citizens 100 times more likely to be shot by policemen than Brits? That seems like a very big number. How comfortable should we be with our high incarceration rates, particularly in light of reports of shoddy forensic science that may have put a non-trivial number of innocents behind bars? Paramilitary police raids (often conducted in the middle of the night, against suspects in non-violent crimes) can no longer reasonably be described as occasional “isolated incidents.” Should we really be okay with that?

Defending the Force

Conservatives are usually so eager to champion civil liberties against the whims of oppressive government. So what’s going on here? Why won’t they admit that America today has too many laws and not enough order?

If conservatives are unfazed by reports of aggressive policing, it’s probably because they suspect that such tactics are necessary.

Actually, there are some fairly good reasons for this sort of conservative reticence. Although I share Friedersdorf’s eagerness to see prudent reforms of our justice system, I always feel deeply conflicted when writing about police abuse, first and foremost because I’m painfully aware that cops do a tough and dangerous job that I probably couldn’t handle. Policemen put themselves on the line for the safety of people they don’t even know. (People like me, and my family.) They spend their lives elbow-deep in violence and vice, so that the rest of us won’t need to. It’s healthy to feel some reticence about taking (verbal) shots at them from the comfort of my front-room recliner.

Obviously, that’s not an adequate reason for shrugging at serious abuse. It’s critically important to maintain high standards for police officers, considering that we give them the power to use potentially-deadly force against American citizens in the streets of our own cities. A badge and gun come with serious responsibility, and dirty cops should be especially offensive to someone who appreciates the intrinsically honorable nature of that work.

But there’s another piece to this puzzle. If conservatives are unfazed by reports of aggressive policing, it’s probably because they suspect that such tactics are necessary. That, in their view, is mostly the fault of progressive liberals, whose political hubris and cultural carelessness have left us with an angry, dysfunctional, and lawless underclass.

Scapegoating the Police

Law enforcement is challenging by nature, but it’s especially hard when the police are expected to serve as a flood gate against the consequences of a million bad policy decisions. That insight largely explains the conservative reflex to sneer when liberals decry oppressive law enforcement. In the eyes of law-and-order conservatives, the police have effectively been tasked with containing the squalor created by decades of liberal folly. Nitpicking the way they go about this nasty job just seems like a bridge too far.

America’s cities are home to a deeply dysfunctional urban culture. This is not just the consequence of bad policing.

Perhaps the most stalwart defender of this type of view has been Heather Mac Donald. Over many years of commenting on this topic, Mac Donald has been particularly assiduous about arguing that apparent evidence of “racial bias” on the part of policemen really just reflects disparate levels of lawlessness. Young African-American males are indeed disproportionately likely to be stopped, arrested, shot, or killed by the police. That’s because the former are dramatically more likely to be engaged in criminal activity. According to Mac Donald, there’s good reason to think that the police are actually less likely to shoot or kill black suspects, if we adjust for disparate rates of criminality.

Whether or not this is generally true, one thing surely is: America’s cities are home to a deeply dysfunctional urban culture. This is not just the consequence of bad policing. Decades of infantilizing liberal policies have undermined family and community structures, leaving a hideous legacy of illegitimacy, addiction and criminality. Conservatives stick up for the police because they understand how dearly liberals would love to make law enforcement into their scapegoat. And that just isn’t reasonable. There’s no nice or happy way to deal with this level of social breakdown, and if you aren’t willing to discuss the deleterious effects of the welfare state and the sexual revolution, you’re in a poor position to criticize the police.

A Compromise: Let’s Blame Everybody

America’s urban neighborhoods are a mess, and that’s not all the fault of the police. But Friedersdorf’s criticisms might still be legitimate. Balko and others have documented some genuinely worrisome trends in police activity: increased militarization, decreased concern with the civil liberties of civilians, and a tendency to harass civilians over small-time offenses while large crimes go unsolved. We don’t have to decide whether to blame the police or failed social policies. We can criticize both.

Unsurprisingly, people react more negatively to the disciplinary measures than to the unearned benefits. But they might really be part of a single lamentable whole.

Actually this makes perfect sense. Bad parents often combine over-indulgence with sporadic, ill-considered efforts at discipline. In a similar way, the infantilizing of America’s poor might be seen both in an imprudent welfare state and in the inconsistent, bullying tendencies of local law enforcement (encouraged by small-time bureaucrats who want the statistics to show that they are “doing something” about the unruly urban poor). Unsurprisingly, people react more negatively to the disciplinary measures than to the unearned benefits. But they might really be part of a single lamentable whole.

If that’s true, good conservatives should want to re-examine the whole system, including both the carrots (benefit programs) and the sticks (criminal justice). On the justice side, that probably means (among other things) reining in police unions, decriminalizing a number of trivial “offenses,” changing our incentive structures to promote the good kind of police work, and implementing sentencing reform.

Conservatives are right to want to protect the police from liberal scapegoating. But we can’t afford to leave law enforcement as the one branch of government that gets a free pass to operate however it sees fit. A true “law and order” conservative should demand good laws, and real order.

Activists Use Charges Of Police Racism To Justify A Huge Power Grab,"Advocates of a mandatory national database on police shootings say it’s just a matter of collecting data to solve the “epidemic problem” of police violence in our nation. But it’s not so simple. A national database will inevitably lead to sweeping national regulations that will make local departments beholden to the feds.

In other words, it’s one step closer to a federal takeover of local policing. A national database will help ever-so-trustworthy and “competent” experts at the national level use ginned-up civil-rights crises and manipulated data, which don’t take into account particular, unique situations on the ground, to build uniform standards they’ll impose from the top down.

Two Democratic senators have proposed a bill that will require states to report to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) all shootings involving a police officer or any other use of force that results in death. Currently, local police departments are not required to report these data to the feds, so the Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn’t have a comprehensive database on what’s going on in the more than 18,000 police agencies across the nation. Senators Barbara Boxer and Cory Booker want to end that by creating a national database on every shooting—fatal or nonfatal—including age, gender, race, and whether the person was armed.

“Too many members of the public and police officers are being killed, and we don’t have reliable statistics to track these tragic incidents,” Boxer said. “This bill will ensure that we know the full extent of the problem so we can save lives on all sides.”

How Could Collecting Data Hurt Anyone?

The “we” Boxer is referring to, of course, is the federal government. It’s not enough that local departments and states carry out their own investigations when shootings happen; according to Boxer and activists who are compiling their own databases, the federal government needs the information so they can have more oversight of local authorities and bring about reform.

How will they interpret the data, and what are they going to do with it?

It sounds quite reasonable to gather data—what’s the harm in collecting information?—but any time the federal government does so, we need to pause and ask, “How will they interpret the data, and what are they going to do with it?” The obvious answer is to bring about one-size-fits-all national reforms, something I recently discussed with supporters of the bill on KCRW’s “To the Point.”

Jim Bueermann, former chief of the police department in Redlands, California, and president of the Police Foundation, said he is for a national database because shootings are grossly under-reported, and it will promote accountability and transparency of policing in the United States.

Jon Swaine of The Guardian has been working to build an independent database with “The Counted” and says they’ve found that the number of minorities, particularly blacks, killed by police is much higher than reported.

Local Control Means Better Accountability

While Bueermann and reporters at The Guardian are well-intentioned in wanting to protect innocent lives by holding police accountable, top-down reforms aren’t the way to do it. Local policing is a matter for the states, and the federal government needs to stay out of it unless federal laws have been violated. If activists want reform, they need to go about the difficult task of doing it on the state level instead of looking to the feds to impose their will on local authorities.

If activists want reform, they need to go about the difficult task of doing it on the state level instead of looking to the feds to impose their will on local authorities.

We have a very diverse nation, and police departments are local because we want officers to be invested in the community, to know the people they are policing. Every situation is different, and every department is unique, with varied needs and budgets. Charlotte, North Carolina, for example, doesn’t need or want the same regulations or “best practices” that Chicago has. Certainly, Dade County in Florida is very different from Montgomery County in Maryland—a county that is well-known for its transparency and has a lot of money to make that happen effectively.

The call for national reform, however, is based on a false meme that local police can’t be trusted, that they’re out of control, and white cops are killing blacks every chance they get. This simply isn’t true—53 percent of Americans are very confident in cops, while only 16 percent have little or no confidence in them. Most cops are faithful at doing their job, and maligning them only encourages civil unrest, which leads to federal intrusion.

When a police shooting happens, local authorities investigate the incident. The state gets involved if the department doesn’t do its job. Detectives, state and district attorneys, forensic specialists—people on the ground and familiar with the local situation—are involved in holding the officer accountable and bringing charges. If reforms are needed, they need to happen at the state and local level. Even now, state legislatures and police departments are engaged in developing improved measures, including more training. Others have established “shooting teams” that can thoroughly investigate each incident.

Dispersing Power Protects Innocent People

It would violate our constitutional system for the federal government to impose intrusive and uniform alterations. This is the reality of federalism and our system of government with its separation of powers. We’re not like the United Kingdom, with a national police force. We’re 50 states with separate, autonomous powers. That’s a good thing, because diversity and dispersion of power protect Americans from abuse of centralized power.

Federalism protects us from abuse that will inevitably come when police power is in the hands of a few.

While federalism is complex and doesn’t lend itself to easy solutions, it’s necessary to protect citizens from the federal government. The abuse of power by police officers that are spread over thousands of agencies can be a valid concern, but people need to be more concerned with abuse of power by a single centralized authority. Federalism protects us from abuse that will inevitably come when police power is in the hands of a few.

The protective shield of federalism, however, is being shredded in the name of civil rights as the federal government is getting more involved in local policing. After the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, President Obama called for national reforms to “end discriminatory policing,” although the shooting wasn’t a civil-rights violation, but a case of self-defense by the police officer.

Using Racism as a Pretense

Still, groups like “Color of Change” (among others) have answered Obama’s call for national reform by demanding mandatory reporting, stirring up racial conflicts, and calling for more investigations into presumed civil-rights violations. Color of Change has turned up in Texas to demand that the Justice Department investigate the police officer who has resigned over an incident at a pool party in McKinney. In highly charged language, the group is stoking the fires of racial tensions.

In highly charged language, the group is stoking the fires of racial tensions.

“There are few words to describe the inhumanity of McKinney law enforcement and Officer Casebolt’s brutal, unprofessional and discriminatory violence this past weekend,” said Color Of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson. “Our hearts go out to all the teens who experienced the terror and pain of unjust treatment at the hands of police, a trauma all too familiar to Black people across the country. . . . In America, pools have long been a place where the boundaries of racial segregation are enforced and what happened in McKinney is no different. The fact that white residents thought the teens, who had guest passes, ‘didn’t have permission to be there’ highlights the racism that kicked off the ensuing police violence. Dehumanizing racial stereotypes about Black girls and boys as ‘inherently wrong’ and ‘out of place’ in white spaces continues to rule the daily lives of Black people. McKinney, Texas, is no different.”

Color of Change hopes gathering data on local police and forming a national database will help stop such discrimination. If they can prove “from the numbers” that there is indeed police abuse on a widespread scale, they think it will justify increasingly involving the federal government in local policing.

The Problem With Data

The problem with data-collecting is that people can make massive amounts of data say anything if they don’t analyze them in context and consider all the associated complexities. William Sousa, a data collection specialist from the University of Nevada, made this point on the “To the Point” interview. Numbers could show that police shootings are on the rise, but if they are only happening in one area of the country, for example, then one can’t say the nation has a problem. People need to look at the numbers in context—which is very difficult to do.

Buerrmann said he has confidence that numbers can be beneficial because we’ll be using data specialists to interpret the information, not politicians. I wish that would be the case, but the fact is politicians will be the ones using the numbers to implement laws, and politicians have agendas. The agenda of the current administration and of the Democratic Party is clear: more federal control over local policing.

The Feds Already Oversee the Police

A point being lost in this debate is that local departments already have federal oversight. Since the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 after the Rodney King incident, the DOJ has been authorized to step in when there’s misconduct in local police departments. They write letters, initiate legal action, and put monitors in place. They did this to such an extent in Louisiana that it led to a federal takeover, in essence, of the police department.

Just because there’s a problem in Cleveland or Ferguson doesn’t mean there’s a problem everywhere.

If this system isn’t working (and some say it isn’t, because the policy was driven more by public sentiment than facts), then maybe that needs to be revisited instead of creating a new law which will lead to even more federal infringements of state autonomy.

More importantly, we need to put the “problem” of police shootings in perspective. Even the Washington Post, which has done a lot of reporting on the need for a national database, has stated that shooting deaths by police officers are rare—and most are justified. Only about 300 agencies have each reported one death this year—that’s out of thousands of agencies.

The fact is the vast majority of police departments in the country don’t have a problem. Local communities, by and large, are satisfied with their police departments. Already in 25 states, local departments are required by state law to report all shooting deaths to the state. When a police shooting happens, it’s reported and investigated. Officers are held accountable. That’s the norm. Why bring uniform and expensive federal reforms to all states when a small percentage has a problem?

Reform needs to be driven, not by national politicians and activist groups responding to a few incidents, but from within local departments and state legislatures. Just because there’s a problem in Cleveland or Ferguson doesn’t mean there’s a problem everywhere. Each state needs to take care of its own, and the federal government needs to respect their autonomy.

NYC Agrees To $5.9 Million Settlement With Eric Garner's Family,"Nearly a year after Eric Garner’s homicide at the hands of police, New York City on Monday reached a $5.9 million settlement with Garner’s family. Garner died shortly after he was placed in a chokehold by police in July of 2014.

According to the New York Times:

New York City reached a settlement on Monday with the family of Eric Garner, agreeing to pay $5.9 million to resolve the claim over his killing by the police last July on Staten Island, according to a lawyer representing the family.



The agreement, reached days before the deadline to file suit in the death, appeared to be among the biggest reached so far as part of a strategy by the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, to settle major civil rights claims even before a lawsuit is filed. Mr. Stringer has said the aim is to save taxpayers the expense of a drawn-out trial and to give those bringing the suits and their families a measure of closure.



Last year, Mr. Garner’s relatives, including his widow, Esaw Garner, and with his mother, Gwen Carr, filed a notice of claim — a procedural step that must precede a lawsuit against the city — seeking $75 million in damages. Mr. Garner died on July 17 after a police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, placed him in a chokehold during an arrest as other officers wrestled him to the ground. The confrontation was captured in a cellphone video taken by a bystander.

Garner’s death caused a nationwide outcry about excessive force by police. Garner, who was cited by law enforcement for selling cigarettes, resisted arrest and told police he was tired of being harassed by them. After police placed him in a chokehold — one that was explicitly banned by police because it “cut[s] off the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain” — Garner repeatedly yelled, “I can’t breathe!” As Garner lay on the ground dying, EMS personnel at the scene refused to assist him.

Citing evidence that Garner died due to “compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,” the medical examiner classified Garner’s death as a homicide. A Staten Island jury, however, refused to indict the officer responsible for placing Garner in a chokehold that was explicitly prohibited by NYPD.

The city had until July 17, the one-year anniversary of Eric Garner’s homicide, to settle the claim with his family or risk a full-blown wrongful death lawsuit for up to $75 million.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/13/hands-up-dont-sue-nyc-offers-5-9-million-settlement-to-eric-garners-family/,2015-07-13
Gay Versus Trans Bar Fight Breaks Out Over ‘Stonewall’,"When director Roland Emmerich set out to create his upcoming film “Stonewall,” he was engaging in a labor of love. He desired to tell the very American story of standing up to power and demanding equal rights. What he could not have expected is that angry backlash and threats of boycotts would come, not from right-wing, religious zealots, but from the LGBT community itself. Now Emmerich stands accused of whitewashing and cis-washing the seminal event in gay-rights history.

The allegation is that Emmerich, by choosing a white protagonist from middle America (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to tell his story, is trying to deny others, specifically trans persons of color, their rightful place as the true heroes of Stonewall. This is all based on a relatively recent myth that it was the transvestites (as they were then known) who were at the vanguard of the riot, leading the pasty, limp-wristed, white, gay crowd to courage they could never have summoned on their own. “Stonewall” stands accused of perpetuating a racist and anti-trans version of the past.

The accusation is absurd on its face. But the widespread willingness of many on the Left and in the gay community to embrace the very flawed narrative used to attack Emmerich is telling. It speaks not only to the rewriting of gay history, but to a broader effort to ensure that our historical record is purged of references to the heroic actions of overly privileged people. Not only must the privileged of today confess their advantages, the privileged of the past must be stripped of their laurels.

What Really Happened?

In the history of the gay-rights movement, Stonewall stands out as the opening act of the dramatic struggle, one that brought us to the wide acceptance of homosexuality in society today. The riot at the Stonewall Inn is rightfully regarded as the first angry demand for equal rights by the LGBT community. What should have been a routine police raid on an underground New York City gay bar turned into much more. For a variety of reasons, patrons were fed up. No longer content to scurry off into the night, they stood their ground. The confrontation with police that ensued would forever change the gay-rights movement and the nation.

The confrontation with police that ensued would forever change the gay-rights movement and the nation.

In his excellent book on Stonewall, David Carter recounts the hectic events that led up to the violence of June 29, 1969. In the preceding week, the police had seemed to step up their raids and intimidation of the gay community in New York City’s West Village neighborhood. Some believed this was related to the mayoral election, that Mayor Lindsay was trying to look tough on immoral behavior. Others cited new leadership in the sixth police precinct that covered the neighborhood. But, whatever the cause, tension was high. These were life-and-death issues for many of the closeted gay men, who risked losing their jobs and even their families if they were arrested in a gay bar.

The raid started like many others. The police entered, turned on the lights, and began separating patrons from the people who worked there, including the mafia bosses who ran the illegal club. Another group they separated were the small number of transvestites, who were breaking the law by wearing women’s clothing and who the police suspected of prostitution. Those groups were held in the back room. Meanwhile, in the main room, some gay patrons were filing out after showing ID, and others were stubbornly refusing to leave. As tensions rose, crowds gathered outside, soon in the hundreds. It started to become clear that this would not be another routine raid.

Here’s Where the History Diverges

This is the point at which those who accept the revisionist history of events believe that the trans women of color present, more or less on their own, started fighting back. It is clear from Carter’s book, as well as his valuable collection of first-person accounts, that a trans woman hit a policeman with her purse. There are also accounts of a “butch lesbian” fighting with police outside the club. Other mentions of trans people are scattered.

To demean their acts of courage that night, for any social or political reason, is simply shameful.

But these were a handful of individuals out of hundreds who were hurling coins and cans, trying to overturn a police wagon, and rioting on Christopher Street. The vast majority of these rioters were indeed, young, white, gay men. To demean their acts of courage that night, for any social or political reason, is simply shameful. Any American who celebrated the victory of gay marriage this year owes these men an enormous debt. Those who are repaying that debt with scorn and threats of boycotting a film that celebrates them are engaged in a despicable act.

Consider the accounts of the white, gay men interviewed for an AARP video celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Stonewall. They are quite clear about what led them to riot. It wasn’t the actions of the small number of transvestites that led them to fight back. It was the actions of the police, the frustration of being left behind in a nation that was slowly embracing civil rights. It was the moment when they refused to be cowed by a culture that condemned the very essence of who they were.

Let us be clear that those who accuse “Stonewall,” the movie, of whitewashing and cis-washing the events of that night are calling these men liars. In a terrible and disgusting irony, many of today’s gay-rights activists are accusing their incredibly courageous progenitors of exactly the kind of weakness and passivity that the actions of Stonewall belied. But what could lead to this? How could we have reached the point where those who enjoy the wide acceptance of homosexuality today are damning the memory of the very people who made that acceptance possible?

Heroes Are Heroes for a Reason

Sadly, the current practice of revising history to downplay the contributions of privileged, suspect classes of people is widespread in the academy and popular culture. From the questionable changes to the Advanced Placement American history curriculum to the banishment of Jefferson and Jackson from the lore of the Democratic Party, these erasures are becoming more common. This is rooted in a desire to bring the dark periods of the past into better sync with the enlightened attitudes of modern progressives.

It is the very fact that gay, white men have reached such a level of acceptance in our society that makes them the target of historical revisionism.

This is folly. It is affirmative action applied to historical narrative. In providing a more balanced and diverse version of history, it is not enough for progressives to celebrate the actions of the traditionally unsung. They must also besmirch the traditional heroes. For progressives it is not enough for Emmerich to include trans people of color in his film (which he absolutely does), he must knock the gay, white participants off their pedestal. The gay, white men of Stonewall can no longer be the heroes of their own story. They must rather, apologize for having appropriated an event that they allegedly have no right to call their own.

For those who believe our nation is little more than a breeding ground of inequality, privilege, and racism, the past must be forcibly brought in line with the present. Facts be damned. Circumstances be damned. Unless one was a member of a group or class that is oppressed today, he or she has no business being celebrated in history. Whatever a person accomplished was simply the byproduct of systems meant to ensure his or her dominance.

This irony underlies this entire absurd controversy. It is the very fact that gay, white men have reached such a level of acceptance in our society that makes them the target of historical revisionism. It doesn’t matter that, 40 years ago when the windows were smashed at the Stonewall Inn, these very same men were among the most reviled and vulnerable in our country. Now they have privilege. And they must sacrifice their own proud history in a vain attempt to empower others.

It won’t work. Inventing a historical narrative for trans people or people of color by exaggerating their role in actual events is not empowering. There is no concerted effort to rob transvestites of their role at Stonewall. Even a cursory student of the event is acquainted with their contributions. And people who watch “Stonewall” will become acquainted with them. But the demand that transvestites be treated as the primary motivating factor of the Stonewall riots is hogwash.

The fate of “Stonewall,” the movie, is unclear now. With so much of its target audience convinced it is presenting a maliciously false version of events, who will see it? It’s not the 2005 of “Brokeback Mountain.” The subject matter of homosexuality is no longer shocking enough to ensure ticket sales. Social-justice warriors may succeed in suppressing the film. But no amount of progressive mythology can change what really happened. Stonewall will always belong to the people who fought there, the vast majority of whom were gay, white men.

Why ‘Black Lives Matter’ Isn’t Going To Fix Our Problems,"If I were Hillary Clinton I would have begged the Secret Service just to get a little lazy one day, and allow Black Lives Matter to take over a speaking engagement. How hard can it be to look solemn and concerned while uninvited guests pontificate? Let them say their bit, and then thank them for sharing what’s in their hearts. Make some vague reference to forming a committee. Be sure not to say anything about valuing all lives, because that just makes you a total jerk-wad.

Off-script isn’t Hillary’s style, as we all know. But she couldn’t put off Black Lives Matter forever, so she offered to have a heart-to-heart with a select group of activists. Now the whole nation gets to watch as she wrangles with activists Julius Jones and Daunasia Yancey over the question: does anybody here have an idea what to do about, you know, anything?

Black Lives Matter is admittedly a little agenda-lite. Though their website does have a list of demands, keeping it updated obviously hasn’t been a priority. (Good news, though! You won’t have to scroll to read them all.) It’s unsurprising that the conversation with Hillary largely foundered over the issue of whether it’s wrong for a white woman to advise black activists to explain what, on a level of policy, they actually want.

I too am a white woman, but I’m going to go a bit further than Clinton. I’ve drawn up a practical agenda for Black Lives Matter, which would be beneficial to impoverished minorities nationwide. My advice? Pack it in.

Black Lives Matter Is A Blunt Instrument

There are real problems with our justice system, but Black Lives Matter isn’t going to fix them. It’s a blunt instrument, where precision tools are needed. It specializes in making an impact by flinging selected incidents into the public eye. But that strategy is of limited value in addressing the real problems of black Americans; indeed, it is far more likely to do harm. A prudent policy initiative is unlikely to take root in the shadow of Black Lives Matter’s surging indignation. (Note how many times Jones and Clinton fret over how everyone in the conversation is “feeling”.) Blunt force trauma can be an effective tool for stopping a zombie, but if you’re attempting open heart surgery, a meat mallet isn’t what you need.

Blunt force trauma can be an effective tool for stopping a zombie, but if you’re attempting open heart surgery, a meat mallet isn’t what you need.

Angry people are hard to placate, and in this case, the anger is understandable. In American cities today, blacks are disproportionately incarcerated and shot by the police. They are also disproportionately criminal. And they are disproportionately victimized by criminals. It’s actually somewhat remarkable that the same demographic could be on the unhappy end of law enforcement in almost every possible way.

If you look at the problem from that angle, and maybe squint just a little, you can almost see how it would make sense to suppose that our justice system is actually designed as a mechanism for keeping the black man down. After all, if the purpose of all this punishing “justice” were to secure public safety, wouldn’t you expect urban neighborhoods to be safe? Instead they are awash in drugs and crime. And didn’t we just “go to war with” and “get tough on” those things?

It’s puzzling. I don’t blame Black Lives Matter for being suspicious when politicians pledge their goodwill.

Want Less Violent Death? Hire More Police.

Black Lives Matters regularly reminds us that young, black men are being gunned down in in the streets. This is true. But most of the time, it’s not a policeman who pulls the trigger. Homicide is the leading cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34.

Black Lives Matter has responded to the situation by calling for “a decrease in law-enforcement spending at the local, state and federal levels.” That would make sense if the police were actually an instrument of class oppression, but in the real world, it will mean more violent death.

White privilege, of the most offensive kind, has indeed contributed to the creation a toxic, violence-riddled urban culture.

This doesn’t need to degenerate into a kindergarten-level blame game. Of course, young men should not kill each other, but the fact that they do reflects badly on many people, and also on the system as a whole. America has something of a grim “tradition” of winking at black homicide, extending back to post-Reconstruction South when (as William Stuntz documents in his authoritative book on criminal justice) blacks who killed other blacks were rarely prosecuted or even pursued by the justice system. Similar cultural attitudes prevailed when Southern blacks started migrating in large numbers to the major cities. So long as black violence remained a localized phenomenon, elite whites weren’t greatly bothered about it. White privilege, of the most offensive kind, has indeed contributed to the creation a toxic, violence-riddled urban culture.

Poor blacks have paid the price for this indifference, as Jill Leovy illustrates in her gripping book, Ghettoside. In the absence of real law enforcement, Leovy argues, a reckless kind of honor culture tends to spring up, and young men embrace violence as a substitute for true order. This can easily spawn a vicious cycle; residents increasingly see the police as ineffectual, so their willingness to cooperate goes down. Few detectives will persist in the face of so many obstacles, and the incentives to do so are minimal. No one cares about the young, anonymous victims of “gang violence”. No one, that is, except the countless poor families that have been devastated by the scourge of urban homicide.

How Much Do Black Lives Matter, Again?

When police forces are large, both crime and incarceration rates drop. This is a reasonably consistent statistical trend across multiple decades and regions. If we want to atone for past mistakes, and affirm the value of black life, we should spurn the advice of Black Lives Matter and hire more policemen.

Black Lives Matter is hardly giving the police force the kind of profile it would need to attract that talent.

Of course it is also important to structure the police force properly, giving support to good detectives and ensuring that cops use their time appropriately. When the Justice Department investigated the Ferguson PD, they found substantial evidence of bureaucratic pressure to generate revenue through tickets and citations. Viewed through the lens of Ferguson’s ransacked streets, it seems obvious that these priorities were tragically misplaced. Yes, we want people to respect the law. But if policemen in poor neighborhoods aren’t clearing murders, and are issuing scores of tickets and fines, is it any wonder the residents become antagonistic?

There are some racist cops in America, and sometimes they abuse their power. Black Lives Matter specializes in drawing the public’s attention to this phenomenon. (Of course it’s telling that they made their name on a case in which the evidence didn’t support their narrative. Do activists appreciate the irony of using frenzied media-mobs to persecute individuals before the facts have been gathered?) But before we bury the police under piles of restrictions, we should consider. What kinds of people are likely to end up on the force if it becomes a miserable, hyper-regulated job that nobody respects? By contrast, what sort of people do we need if we want to see crimes solved? Good detectives need to be smart, dedicated and tough. Black Lives Matter is hardly giving the police force the kind of profile it would need to attract that talent.

Before packing up, perhaps Black Lives Matter should consider apologizing to Darren Wilson for unjustifiably ruining his life. One way to value black life would be by assuring good cops that America has their backs, as they protect the people who are most at risk.

Wanted: A Justice System That Pursues Justice

After crime, there is punishment. Mass incarceration has become the other major issue on the agenda of Black Lives Matter. Why are so many black men incarcerated? What can we do to get them back home with their families?

One thing we could do, of course, is just open the gates and let the captives free. If indeed (following the logic of the “New Jim Crow”) our penal system exists primarily for purposes of racially-based class oppression, that is exactly what we should do. Realistically, though, most people are in prison for a reason. Even if that reason doesn’t always justify incarceration, it would be foolhardy in the extreme to start freeing inmates en masse.

Quite often, the system is “efficient” in exactly the place it should not be.

What young men need is fathers, and that problem predates the surge in black incarceration. Looking at the system itself, though, what is really needed is stability. A system of law and order ought to leave the public with a sense of order. Ours is too moody, which is partly why people don’t trust it.

As Stuntz shows, our justice system suffers from a kind of bipolar disorder. Looking over the last century we can see that it has at times been too lenient, while at other times it is too harsh. How much time you serve for dealing drugs or offing your housemate will vary widely, depending on the year in which your malfeasance occurs. And, to be sure, other should-be-irrelevant factors may also come into play. Race can be one. Age, income, sex and education level might also make a difference in how you fare, once you find yourself in the belly of the legal beast. For instance, it’s a bad idea to get yourself arrested if you happen to be too poor to afford bail and a defense attorney. The dispossessed have a hard time navigating the ins and outs of our technocratic legal machine.

Clearly, these are not good justifications for denying people careful attention in bureaucratic decisions that will change the course of their whole lives. But mistakes happen, and one reason they do is because the court system is so overloaded. Neither public defenders nor district attorneys can afford to linger too long over a particular case. No doubt this will come as an absolute shock to Federalist readers, but overworked bureaucrats don’t always display perfect prudence and unimpeachable integrity.

Lady Justice is meant to be blind. Black Lives Matter would have us fix her by donning black-tinted glasses.

Quite often, the system is “efficient” in exactly the place it should not be: pressuring poorly-represented detainees into accepting plea bargains without a thorough investigation of the facts. Stuntz also notes that while policing and courts are generally funded locally, the state picks up the tab for incarceration. Our prison system may be hugely burdensome for taxpayers, but for a local bureaucrat, there’s a fiendish logic to pressing for quick, lightly-investigated convictions.

These are all significant problems, and the list continues. Our penal system could do more to reduce recidivism and help people go straight. Better addiction treatment programs, combined with smarter sentencing, might enable more convicts to pull their lives together and become productive citizens. Some states are already working on this, with encouraging results. Saving money on incarceration might enable us to improve our policing and our courts.

Beat Your Sledge-Hammers Into Scalpels

It’s understandable that poor blacks are frustrated with our justice system. To make things better, however, we have to be realistic about the actual problems. The system needs surgery, not a full frontal assault. Nothing will be fixed with a sledge-hammer like Black Lives Matter.

If politicians are pressured into making some grand, sweeping gestures in the name of racial justice, it’s quite unlikely that we will end up with a system focused on criminal justice. That of course is what our nation actually needs, especially for the sake of impoverished minorities, who suffer the most from widespread lawlessness.

Lady Justice is meant to be blind. Black Lives Matter would have us fix her by donning black-tinted glasses. Does that sound like an effective strategy?

Why We Need Police Reform,"In the United States there is perhaps no public service sector more hostile to criticism than our police forces. At even the mildest criticism, the response from the police is almost universally one of abject whining. A police officer in Birmingham was recently pistol-whipped after he hesitated to use force against a suspect. “A lot of officers are being too cautious because of what’s going on in the media,” the officer said.

In other words, police are now openly admitting that upon being criticized their first instinct is to stop doing their job. When the citizenry expresses a bit of unhappiness with the regular criminal violence and corruption that marks many police departments today, the response from the police themselves is to become scared and cease to do the things we pay them to do. It is yet more evidence that, as I have written before, in many parts of the United States the police no longer work for you.

The arrest of Sandra Bland was a textbook example of this dismal trend. Bland committed suicide in her Texas county jail cell after being arrested by a state trooper. The reason she was arrested in the first place would be laughable, if she were not dead. The officer ordered Bland to put out her cigarette, and she—under no legal obligation whatsoever to do so—refused. The police officer was offended, as police officers are wont to be. The situation escalated from there, culminating in Bland’s arrest and her eventual, as-of-yet inexplicable hanging.

We Must Take Actions To Reform Police Behavior

Sandra Bland is dead, in other words, because she briefly and legally annoyed a police officer. Had Trooper Brian Encinia been of a slightly less megalomaniacal bent, she would still be alive. But she is not. Given that police departments all over the country are generally hostile towards the idea of punishing the criminal cops on their payroll, the police officer in this case is unlikely to suffer any negative repercussions whatsoever. And so we must again ask ourselves what we are going to do about this. How are we to get our police departments under control again?

Sandra Bland is dead, in other words, because she briefly and legally annoyed a police officer.

The first step would be to implement and enforce a zero-tolerance policy for the abuses of power in which police regularly and freely engage. The burden of proof for such incidents should be high, but in cases when the officer is clearly in the wrong – as Trooper Encinia was in ordering Sandra Bland from her car and arresting her – the sanctions should be swift: suspension, probation, in many cases termination. For quite some time now, police officers have acted under the correct assumption that higher management will tolerate their lawlessness and their thuggish behavior. We must demand that the police police their own, either internally or by way of local or statewide ordinances.

But this will not be easy, in part because the structural self-interest of the police is very well established. When a job allows the employees to effectively steal money with impunity, throw people in jail for no reason, and get away with it, the employer is not liable to change its practices. Moreover, such reform cannot come about from a single law passed by Congress. Our police departments are a nationwide problem, but they are not a national problem: the solution to each lawless police brigade must necessarily be a local one, which will necessarily be a more difficult proposition than reforming a single political entity.

There Has To Be A Solution; We Cannot Go Without One

Just recently, a young man suspected of stealing pizza in New York City was assaulted by police as he was surrendering. He was defenseless and holding his hands up, which is when one of New York’s finest thought it would be a good time to punch him thrice in the head. It is again entirely probable that the violent, hair-trigger policeman in this case will suffer no meaningful consequences whatsoever, outside of perhaps being put on a week’s desk duty inside an air-conditioned precinct.

We cannot continue to be policed by vain, egotistical gangsters who feel as if they can arrest us and beat us, and terrorize us at the slightest provocation.

In Virginia, an Iraq War veteran was sleeping in a model unit of his apartment building due to a plumbing problem in his own unit; a neighbor thought he was breaking and entering and called the police on him. The police inexplicably responded by conducting a no-knock raid. The veteran awoke surrounded by three officers with their guns drawn and aimed at him; he was handcuffed and searched before they discovered his identity. A shift commander described this inept, terroristic response as “on point.”

That is about how the police work these days. It must not continue. Police officers need a bit of latitude in order to do their job correctly, and they should not have to worry about losing their jobs or going to jail over exercising that latitude within an acceptable range. And it should be noted that many police officers are honorable, valuable public servants who do genuine good in their communities. But the problem is larger than they are. We cannot continue to be policed by vain, egotistical gangsters who feel as if they can arrest us and beat us, and terrorize us at the slightest provocation. Police reform must happen — for Sandra Bland, and for whoever comes after her.

"No, Black Lives Matter Isn’t About Hurting Cops","Remember when the media punditry swore the Tea Party was driven by secret racism? Remember how people reported racist signs at Tea Party rallies and protests? Remember how the punditry tried to connect the Tea Party with Jared Lee Loughner when he shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six people?

Now we hear that the Black Lives Matter movement is also racist, “promotes the execution of police officers,” as one commentator put it, and has racist or violent signage. Bill O’Reilly boldly declared it a “hate group.” Now some in the media have also implied the Black Lives Matter movement may be to blame for the murder of a Texas police officer, Darren Goforth.

Pundits on the Left who tried to dismiss the Tea Party as a mere racist Republican reaction to a black president were misguided. Those on the Right who chalk up the growing momentum behind Black Lives Matter to racism or a desire to hurt cops are making the same mistake. Black Lives Matter’s main point is to draw attention to police misconduct and the lack of police accountability—particularly as it disproportionately affects black Americans. This is a goal that libertarians, conservatives, liberals, and progressives should care about.

This Is Called the Part to Whole Fallacy

BLM activists’ proposed policy reforms include curbing the excessive use of police force, demilitarization, use of police body cameras, ending racial profiling and “stop and frisk” tactics, addressing over-criminalization, and improving training for police officers. Can reasonable people quibble over the particulars of BLM’s policy platform? Sure. But you don’t have to agree with every policy idea some activists propose to appreciate the main goal of the movement.

You don’t have to agree with every policy idea some activists propose to appreciate the main goal of the movement.

Instead of focusing on BLM’s primary purpose, many in the media have applied the words of some activists to the entire movement or erroneously connected unrelated violent events to BLM—just like some news organizations did with the Tea Party.

For instance, commentators often point to some Minneapolis BLM activists who chanted “pigs in a blanket, fry em’ like bacon” as evidence that the entire movement wants to harm cops. Also, although no evidence connects the tragic killing of Goforth to the BLM movement, pundits have blamed it nonetheless.

In reaction to this labeling of BLM as racist and violent, Fox News contributor and talk radio host Richard Fowler told Fox’s Megyn Kelly: “I don’t think we’re watching the same Black Lives Matter movement. I think if you talk to any of the organizers on the ground, both in Ferguson, in Baltimore, and New York, they will tell you they’re a nonviolent movement. That all they want to do is end the disparities.”

Decentralized Movements Represent a Spectrum

What many fail to realize is that social movements are decentralized heterogeneous coalitions—meaning that different types of people can be drawn to the same movement, sometimes for different reasons. One shouldn’t label an entire movement by the comments and actions of just a few activists—as Fox News contributor Mary Katherine Ham rightfully pointed out. The key is identifying the glue that holds the movement together. In my dissertation on the Tea Party movement, I found several distinct clusters of Tea Partiers, with racial anxieties motivating only a minority slice. But by and large, the overwhelming majority really was about small government.

Different types of people can be drawn to the same movement, sometimes for different reasons.

The same applies to Black Lives Matter: it’s a decentralized movement in which the central thrust focuses on police abuse in the United States, particularly as it disproportionately affects African-Americans.

We—all Americans—should listen to Black Lives Matter. Reform is needed. Surely, this is not just about racial prejudice. Police abuse and lack of accountability affect people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, as white Michigan resident Deven Guilford would tell you if he hadn’t been killed by a cop after flashing his high beams at a police vehicle. At the same time, we should be capable of recognizing that justice in this country is not yet applied without regard to race (i.e., see here), and we should applaud efforts to move society in the right direction.

Conservative pundits balked when some of their colleagues on the Left smeared the Tea Party as a racist movement instead of recognizing it as an effort to reign in big government. They would now do well to take a long, hard look in the mirror with respect to their own coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement and recognize it as an opportunity to make change for the better.

Quentin Tarantino Digs In About Calling Cops Murderers,"Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino is known neither for subtle dialogue nor sedate films, so when he attended the Rise Up rally against police brutality in New York in October, of course he went “Super Fly T.N.T.”

At the rally, Tarantino said, “I’m a human being with a conscience. And if you believe there’s murder going on then you need to rise up and stand up against it. I’m here to say I’m on the side of the murdered.”

Unsurprisingly—at least for those of us who reside outside of Hollywood—he sounded as though he was asserting that all police officers are murderers. There is no need to divine if that was his intent. His thoroughly documented propensity for hyperbole and bombast suggest he was not actually asserting that all police officers are murderers.

There’s also the fact that Tarantino feels comfortable calling the police to come to his own home. Most people avoid inviting licensed murderers over to help them out of a jam.

Say ‘What’ Again. I Dare You, I Double-Dare You!

But Tarantino isn’t backing down. He’s going with a classic “I’m sorry, but…” non-apology. In an interview with Glenn Whipp at the Los Angeles Times, he offered a mild clarification. “All cops are not murderers. I never said that. I never even implied that.” Thanks for clearing that up, because it did sort of sound like you were implying that. Maybe you could’ve skipped offering these thoughts about those who disagree with you, though:

Tarantino is going with a classic ‘I’m sorry, but…’ non-apology.

“What they’re doing is pretty obvious. Instead of dealing with the incidents of police brutality that those people were bringing up, instead of examining the problem of police brutality in this country, better they single me out. And their message is very clear. It’s to shut me down. It’s to discredit me. It is to intimidate me. It is to shut my mouth, and even more important than that, it is to send a message out to any other prominent person that might feel the need to join that side of the argument.”

How are those critical of his arguments singling him out? How are they shutting him down and discrediting him? They’re calling for a boycott of “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s upcoming release. That’s it. That’s not exactly silencing him (although I suppose if a movie shows to an empty theater, does it really make any sound?).

Regardless, those on the Right aren’t generally given to boycotts since they’re stupid and ineffective, so it’s likely a moot point. That’s not stopping Tarantino, though. He’s going all-in, albeit not in hostile territory.

Wait for the Wolf, Who Should be Arriving Directly

While his comments may not have played in Peoria, they’re doing great inside the echo chamber. Tarantino isn’t one to back down from a fight, though, so he stepped outside the echo chamber and went on “Real Time with Bill Maher” on Friday. He dug in, referring to the problem of police shooting unarmed people as a “hydra”: “The biggest head that needs to be chopped off first is this blue-wall idea. The idea that they protect their own rather than put themselves at the betterment of citizenry. I think it’s inside the institution itself.”

Umm, Quentin, implying that all officers are accomplices isn’t exactly the opposite of implying they’re all murderers. In fact, accomplices are often punished just as harshly as the primary perpetrator. For a person so fond of crime drama, this shouldn’t be hard.

Of course, given it was “Real Time,” Tarantino didn’t get any pushback. Instead, he was lauded. Maher isn’t the only everyday citizen defending Tarantino. Michael Moore took a break from touring various all-you-can-eat buffets for pictures to post on Instagram to instead post a message of support on Instagram.



Mark Ruffalo got in on the act, noting the strong persecution artists face for voicing opinions that are at odds with those of average Americans.

Artists need to be able to speak for justice without attacks and retribution. #SideWithQuentin https://t.co/KEbIZKBc3T

And:

“When I see murder, I cannot stand by & I have to call the murdered, the murdered & the murderers, the murderers.” Yes! #SideWithQuentin



— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) November 5, 2015



To be fair, it’s not just famous left-wing activists with loose definitions about what it means to be silenced who are supporting Tarantino. The hashtag #SideWithQuentin is pulling in a number of tweets, including many from everyday Americans.

But it doesn’t speak for all Americans, even if concern about police brutality isn’t as partisan as Tarantino, et. al. imagine it to be. Because it isn’t. What Hollywood doesn’t realize is that if Tarantino had offered a more measured and less defiant response, people might notice that the point he’s claiming he made has some validity.

He Is Truly His Brother’s Keeper and the Finder of Lost Children

For example, here at The Federalist we’ve offered quite a bit on the subject. Here is a call for police reform Daniel Payne wrote after the Sandra Bland tragedy. Rachel Lu examined conservative reticence with regard to reforming the entire criminal justice system, noting that American citizens are “100 times more likely to be shot by policemen than Brits.”

Needed discussions about police brutality and criminal-justice reform get lost in the din stirred up by situations like Tarantino and the Rise Up rally.

After Eric Garner was murdered on the street, Sean Davis wrote, “John Edwards was right: there are Two Americas. There’s an America where people who kill for no legitimate reason are held to account, and there’s an America where homicide isn’t really a big deal as long as you play for the right team.”

It’s not just at this publication, either. Red State’s Leon Wolf is brilliant on the subject, and has written about problems with taking officers to court and why conservatives shouldn’t take the side of the Ferguson police department, as well as pointing out how black Americans are treated worse by police. These aren’t the only examples. Head over to Reason or Cato and you can find similar discussions.

Those nonpartisan and needed discussions about police brutality and criminal-justice reform get lost in the din stirred up by situations like Tarantino and the Rise Up rally. It’s unfortunate for all involved.

Law enforcement officers do not deserve to be broadly labeled murderers at worst and accomplices at best, but we do need to examine their relationship with regular citizens. Regular people do not deserve to be viewed as black and white characters from a script, then ignored or treated as hostile enemies when they criticize hyperbolic generalizations.

Hollywood needs to expand its collective imagination to include these truths. As it stands, it may claim to love dialogue, but when the words leave the page we’re reminded that Hollywood would prefer not to actually engage in it.

Why Is There Zero Evidence Of The Mizzou Poop Swastika?,"Something stinks at the University of Missouri. A reported incident of vandalism at Mizzou sparked university-wide protests, a boycott by the school’s 4-5 football team, and eventually the resignation of the university’s president and chancellor.

There’s only one problem: no evidence of the alleged incident, in which a poop swastika on the wall of a dormitory restroom was reported, has ever been made publicly available. Did this incident occur as reported, or was it an immaculate defecation that formed the foundation of an unimaginable deception?

According to Billy Donley, the president of Mizzou’s Residence Halls Association (RHA), the poop swastika was reported at approximately 2:00 a.m. on October 24, 2015.

“On Saturday, October 24th, at 2:00am an individual came into one of the restrooms in Gateway Hall and drew a swastika on the wall with their own feces,” Donley wrote in a letter several days after the alleged incident. “This event happened while many students, including myself, were already asleep.”

Later in his letter, Donley noted that he only found out about the alleged vandalism incident “via a flyer posted on the walls” of the dorm.

Although Donley did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication, The Federalist spoke with two RHA staffers while trying to get in touch with Donley. Neither had personally witnessed the poop swastika. When asked if there was any photographic evidence of the alleged incident, one staffer replied, “Not to my knowledge.”

Frankie Minor, the director of residential life at Mizzou, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on whether he personally saw the poop swastika or any photographic evidence of it.

The Federalist also attempted to contact Christian Basi, the associate director of the University of Missouri News Bureau, who previously told the Columbia Missourian on Oct. 30 that the incident had been immediately reported to Mizzou police. Basi did not respond to requests for comment prior to the publication of this article.

Calls to the University of Missouri Police Department, which responded to and investigated the alleged poop swastika incident, also failed to yield any evidence of the poopstika.

Multiple activists on Twitter pointed to this photo as proof that the incident occurred as reported, but a Google search for the same image shows that it has been floating around the Internet for nearly a year. A reddit thread from November of 2014 appears to contain the earliest publication of the photo in question, meaning that it most certainly does not constitute proof of the incident alleged to have occurred at Mizzou on October 24, 2015.

Maj. Brian Weimer, the public information officer for the Mizzou police department, told The Federalist that he also did not personally see the poop swastika that was reported to police. When asked if anyone in the police department personally witnessed the swastika, Maj. Weimer clammed up and referred all questions about the incident to the university’s custodian of public records.

The Federalist also repeatedly contacted @ConcernedStudent1950, the Twitter account representing Mizzou protesters who issued a series of demands of university administrators after the alleged poop swastika incident made headlines. The individuals running the @CS1950 account failed to produce any photographic or documentary evidence of the incident prior to publication of this article.

While a mere absence of evidence is not synonymous with evidence of absence, the complete lack of any verifiable photographic evidence of the alleged poop swastika and the lack of any named eye witnesses raises serious questions about the veracity of a racially charged incident of vandalism that eventually led to the resignation of the University of Missouri’s two top administrators.

Did the incident happen as reported, or did two university administrators resign over protests that were sparked by a hoax? And if the incident did happen as reported, a proposition for which no publicly available evidence currently exists, how did university administrators and law enforcement authorities confirm that the vandalism was driven by racial animosity, as opposed to being promulgated as a public relations stunt meant to tar the university for failing to provide an environment free of racist invective? It would not be the first time a public university fell victim to a high profile PR stunt that was later revealed to be a fabrication. Either way, students, their parents, university employees, and Missouri taxpayers deserve solid, verifiable answers based on clear evidence about what exactly transpired in that Gateway Wall bathroom in the early morning of October 24.

Under the provisions of Missouri’s broad public records laws, The Federalist has requested from the University of Missouri copies of any and all records relating to the alleged vandalism, including any police or incident reports describing the investigation of the poop swastika by law enforcement authorities, as well as any photographic records of the alleged swastika, and will make that information available if and when it is received from university officials.

[UPDATE]: Late Wednesday night, the Daily Caller obtained a copy of the police report describing the Mizzou police department’s response to a report of vandalism in Gateway Hall on October 24, 2015. Despite repeated requests from The Federalist for the document and information contained with in it, the University of Missouri still has not provided to The Federalist it or any other documents requested pursuant to the state’s open records laws.

You can read the police report here.

[UPDATE 2]: On Thursday afternoon, pursuant to a public records request previously filed by The Federalist, the University of Missouri released photos of the incident, as well as previously unreported details about an incident the prior week in which a student hurled racial slurs at a white resident of the same dorm. The full details about the documents released on Thursday can be found here.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/10/was-the-poop-swastika-incident-at-mizzou-a-giant-hoax/,2015-11-10
Meet The Mizzou Student Who First Hyped The Poop Swastika,"On October 28, Mizzou student dorm association president Billy Donley dropped a bomb on his fellow students: somebody at the University of Missouri drew a swastika in one of the school’s dorms. Donley’s claim, which was later expanded to include allegations that the swastika was drawn with human feces, ignited a racial firestorm that eventually led to the resignations of Mizzou’s top two university administrators.

Unfortunately, there’s no publicly available evidence that this incident ever occurred.

By all accounts, Donley, a class of 2018 undergraduate student who serves as the president of the Mizzou Residence Halls Association (RHA), was the first person to publicly reference the poop swastika incident. That announcement occurred on Twitter on October 28.

Very upset and angry to hear that a swastika has been drawn in one of the Residence Halls on Campus. Expect a statement from me later today.



Billy Donley (@RHAPresident) October 28, 2015

On October 29, the first news article about the alleged incident appeared in The Maneater, a campus paper. The sole source for the factual claims asserted in the article appears to be a letter that Donley published on RHA letterhead earlier that day.

In that letter, Donley wrote that the alleged incident occurred at approximately 2:00 a.m. on October 24 in a bathroom inside Gateway Hall, a university dorm. The student dorm president also asserted in his letter that the swastika was not just drawn with feces, but that the perpetrator used his or her own feces to draw the swastika. Donley did not disclose how he came to determine that the poop was human, rather than canine or feline, for example, or that it belonged to the alleged suspect. Donley noted that he did not witness the poop swastika first-hand. Instead, he “found out via a flyer posted on the walls” of the dormitory, according to his letter.

On October 30, two more articles appeared in local papers that cover the University of Missouri. Each article repeated as fact the assertions contained in Donley’s October 29 letter.

Despite extensive efforts to elicit information from law enforcement authorities, university officials, and even dormitory custodial staff who would have been responsible for removing traces of the fecal vandalism, The Federalist has yet to verify any of the facts initially asserted by Donley.

Repeated phone calls and e-mails to Christian Basi, a university spokesman, went unreturned. Repeated phone calls and e-mails to Frankie Minor, the university employee who oversees all residential life operations, went unreturned.

Billy Donley also refused to return multiple phone calls and e-mails requesting clarifications on the alleged facts of the poop swastika incident. When The Federalist contacted the Mizzou police department requesting information on when officers first responded to the scene and whether they witnessed the poop swastika first-hand, the department spokesman referred all questions to the university’s office of public records.

When The Federalist contacted the custodial department tasked with cleaning and maintaining the university’s many dormitories, a maintenance department staffer referred all questions about the poop swastika incident to the university’s public relations department.

As of Wednesday, zero pictures of the alleged poop swastika have been released. Zero video evidence has been released. No suspects have been publicly identified. No eyewitnesses have publicly come forward to discuss the specifics of the alleged incident. In an age of constant selfies and ubiquitous smartphones, the lack of any photographic evidence of the poop swastika raises serious questions about whether the entire incident was a hoax.

On Wednesday morning, Rabia Gregory, a professor of religious studies at the University of Missouri, asserted on Twitter that one of her students saw the poop swastika first-hand. Unfortunately, Gregory refused to release the identity of the alleged eyewitness.

@historicalcurio one of my students did. I will not identify that student. there have been too many incidents of violent harassment for that



Rabia Gregory (@RabiaGregory) November 11, 2015

“I will not identify that student, Gregory wrote. “There have been too many incidents of violent harassment for that.”

Gregory did not respond to phone calls or e-mails from The Federalist asking for information about the alleged eyewitness prior to the publication of this article.

Billy Donley, the RHA president who first started spreading allegations about a dorm bathroom poop swastika, appears to be an avid supporter of the campus protest movement whose demands, spurred in large part by news reports about the poop swastika, led to the resignations of the university’s president and chancellor. On November 6, Donley changed the cover photo on his Facebook page to the black and white logo for ConcernedStudent1950, the student protest group that spearheaded the protests that have consumed the Mizzou campus for weeks:

Donley has thus far refused to respond to any requests from The Federalist for comment on the incident or to provide any evidence that it occurred as reported. As of Wednesday morning, his personal Twitter account was locked and protected, a measure that prevents the public from viewing his tweets.

Under Missouri state law, it is against the law to falsely report a crime to law enforcement authorities. Individuals convicted of falsely reporting a crime to the police, a class B misdemeanor, may face up to six months in prison.

UPDATE: After this article was initially published, Prof. Rabia Gregory responded to The Federalist‘s inquiry for information about the eyewitness to whom she referred in her tweet.

“I actually can’t give out contact information of students without their permission due to how FERPA is interpreted in my college so even if I weren’t concerned for their safety I wouldn’t be able to put you in touch directly,” she wrote. “I will instead pass on your message both over email and in an announcement to both of my classes in a general way and ask that if anyone who was there is willing to speak with you about it they should do so.”

“I think it would be a positive step to get this report verified and to urge campus police to continue their investigation.”

[UPDATE 2:] Late Wednesday night, the Daily Caller obtained the police report of the October 24 incident, which corroborates the basic details of the incident asserted in Donley’s October 29 letter.

The police report, which can be read in full here, shows that an officer responded to a vandalism complaint at Gateway Hall, a Mizzou dormitory, at 2:12 a.m. on October 24, 2015.

“I noticed there was a swastika drawn on the wall by someone using feces,” the responding officer wrote in the report. “There was also feces on the floor located by the entry way to the restroom.”

The bulk of the officer’s report is redacted. No suspects are listed, and no motivations for the fecal display are listed in the police report. The report does not include any photographic evidence of the poop swastika. Although the initial incident occurred in the early morning hours of October 24, the police report was not prepared and filed until the evening of October 29. An official investigator was assigned to the case on October 26, according to the report.

[UPDATE 3]: On Thursday afternoon, pursuant to a public records request previously filed by The Federalist, the University of Missouri released photos of the incident, as well as previously unreported details about an incident the prior week in which a student hurled racial slurs at a white resident of the same dorm.

Mizzou Finally Releases Poop Swastika Police Report,"The University of Missouri released a police report Wednesday night that was prepared following a complaint that a swastika made of poop was found in a dormitory bathroom at the university in late October.

The police report was obtained by the Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross.

Many questions remain about a swastika scrawled in feces in a bathroom at a residence hall on the University of Missouri last month. But a police report obtained by The Daily Caller on Wednesday does show that a university police officer did observe the scrawling.



The so-called poop swastika has been the subject of intense speculation in recent days. University police and other school officials and staffers have declined to provide any information on who observed the scrawling, whether police saw it and whether it was photographed.

The police report, which can be read in full here, shows that an officer responded to a vandalism complaint at Gateway Hall, a Mizzou dormitory, at 2:12 a.m. on October 24, 2015.

“I noticed there was a swastika drawn on the wall by someone using feces,” the responding officer wrote in the report. “There was also feces on the floor located by the entry way to the restroom.”

Although the initial incident occurred in the early morning hours of October 24, the police report was not prepared and filed until the evening of October 29. An official investigator was assigned to the case on October 26, according to the report.

On Tuesday evening, a woman who claims to work for the university’s custodial services division stated in the comments section of a Fox Sports article that the poop swastika incident did happen as reported.

“I am a custodian for the MU residence halls,” she wrote in a comment to the article. “The [poop swastika] did happen.” She also posted on her Facebook page, which lists her employer as the University of Missouri Residential Life division, that “[a]s a custodian that works in the dorms I can confirm that the ‘poopswastika’ happened.”

The Federalist repeatedly requested records from the University of Missouri pertaining to the poop swastika, but university officials refused to respond to the inquiries. An official public records request by The Federalist, which was filed with the university’s records custodian on Tuesday morning, received no response. Repeated requests over multiple days for records and information from the university’s public relations division, its custodial services division, and its residential life division were ignored as well.

When The Federalist contacted the residential custodial services division Wednesday morning, a staffer directed all inquiries about the poop swastika incident to the university’s public relations division, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment or clarification.

[UPDATE]: On Thursday afternoon, pursuant to a public records request previously filed by The Federalist, the University of Missouri released photos of the incident, as well as previously unreported details about an incident the prior week in which a student hurled racial slurs at a white resident of the same dorm.

How Colorado Springs Honored The Officer Killed In Friday's Shooting,"Colorado Springs residents honored the police officer who was killed in the line of duty on Friday during the shooting at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.

Police officer Garrett Swasey was killed during a five-hour standoff between the alleged shooter and law enforcement. Swasey, 44 years old, was a husband to Rachel and father of two children, Elijah, 10 years old, and Faith, 6 years old.

Elijah will turn 11 on Sunday.

Garrett Swasey was an elder at Hope Chapel, a church in Colorado Springs, where he also played guitar for worship services. He was a nationally ranked ice dancer and had served on the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs police force for six years. He was reportedly pro-life, and had spoken out against the abortion industry, but on Friday, he voluntarily rushed to help individuals being held hostage at Planned Parenthood.

In his last sermon, which is available for listening here, Swasey spoke of bringing glory to God by one’s actions. Swasey said:

Our objective is not to bring glory to ourselves but to bring glory to God. How? By transforming our lives through the gospel, apart from that it can’t be done, not in our own strength. Everything we have comes from the Lord and everything we have should glorify the Lord. And everything we need is provided by God because Christ is sufficient.

The names of the other two victims, who have been identified as civilians, will not be released until Monday, after the autopsy has been completed. Nine others were injured during the standoff, but are reportedly in stable condition and expected to survive.

In response to officer Swasey’s death, community members have been honoring his life and death. Locals placed flowers and notes at the scene of the shooting on Saturday.

According to reports, Swasey did not have to respond to the shooting, but he rushed to the scene as soon as he heard the news. He was one of the first officers to respond yesterday and was shot soon after he arrived on the scene.

“There was no way any of us could have kept him here yesterday during the tragedy,” UCCS Police Chief Brian McPike said.

"In Tamir Rice Case, Cleveland Was A Police Disaster Waiting To Happen","Michael Brown was (plausibly) lunging for an officer’s weapon when Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed him. Eric Garner didn’t pose much of a threat, but he was resisting arrest, and the tactics used to subdue him wouldn’t have been life-threatening but for a particular medical condition. Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was just playing with a toy pistol in a Cleveland public park when the police gunned him down in broad daylight.

No charges will be brought against the officers involved.

This is a disturbing case. It cannot reasonably be dismissed as a trumped-up grievance-fest, or even just a tragedy of errors. Rice died as a consequence of a serious police error, in a county with a history of overaggressive, undisciplined policing.

Human Resources Screwed Up

Ironically, Officer Timothy Loehmann’s salvation may have been the sheer volume of screw-ups that contributed to Rice’s death. In explaining why Loehmann was exonerated, Prosecutor Tim McGinty described the situation as “a perfect storm of human error.” Quite a number of people do seem to have demonstrated shocking incompetence here. Let’s do a run-down.

Loehmann’s emotional issues made him unreliable with a firearm.

We can start with the person who hired Loehmann to work for the Cleveland police. Loehmann had left his previous job with a suburban police department in what appeared to be a “quit or be fired” situation. He had mental health and maturity issues, and his deputy chief expressed the opinion that neither time nor training could make him a capable cop. His biggest problem? His emotional issues made him unreliable with a firearm. He became “distracted” and “weepy” even during a training session.

After losing his first job, he applied unsuccessfully to multiple other departments and finally got hired in Cuyahoga County. Within a few months on the job, he’d killed a preteen armed with a toy.

So Did The Dispatcher

Next we could look to the dispatcher, Beth Mandl, who informed Loehmann and his partner Frank Garmback that an armed man in a public park was frightening local residents. The person who called in this tip had told the dispatcher the suspect looked like a juvenile, and that the gun was likely a fake.

Doesn’t that sound like the sort of information the responding officers should have? Apparently Mandl didn’t think so.

Mandl’s background should also have raised concerns, given that she had been fired from her last dispatcher job in 2008. Last summer she quit her job with the Cleveland police, though only after failing to come to work for three months, without explanation.

So Did the Partner

It’s heartbreaking to think this tragedy might have been averted if the officers had been fully informed. Still, given that they thought they were dealing with an armed adult, wouldn’t you expect the officers in charge to exercise some caution in approaching the situation?

Less than two seconds after the officers’ arrival, the twelve-year-old was on the ground.

Footage from the scene shows that Rice was alone in the park. If bystanders were indeed alarmed by his actions, they had evidently had the good sense to get some distance. The police weren’t so prudent. Garmback drove directly up to Rice and, seeing hands somewhere around his mid-section, Loehmann emerged from the squad car firing. Less than two seconds after the officers’ arrival, the twelve-year-old was on the ground.

Loehmann now claims he warned Rice three times to show his hands. No witnesses heard this. More importantly, watch the video for yourself. (Start at the one-minute mark, and it’ll take you ten seconds, literally!) Decide whether that claim is plausible. Could Loehmann possibly have had time to issue such a command, let alone three?

Did I Mention Cleveland Has a History of Police Aggression?

When reading about high-profile cases like this, you may find yourself wondering: are we making too much of the occasional mistake? Was this mostly a freak incident?

The evidence suggests that the culture of a justice system makes a huge difference in officers’ behavior.

Usually the answer is “no.” Of course we should all appreciate that policing is dangerous, and that we can’t expect people to have perfect judgment in their split-second decisions. But the evidence suggests that the culture of a justice system makes a huge difference in officers’ behavior. Incidents like this arise far more frequently in regions with a history of police brutality and prosecutorial abuse. Cleveland definitely qualifies.

As it happens, Rice’s shooting in November 2014 preceded by mere days the release of a Department of Justice report on the Cleveland police. The report details a litany of problems, among them unexplained (and unconstitutional) stops and searches, and punitive physical aggression against suspects who were already handcuffed or otherwise restrained.

The DOJ observed that the Cleveland police seemed to have adopted a militaristic “us against them” mentality with respect to the local population, even noting little details, such as a public sign at a local station designating it the “forward operating base.” They noted, as well, that officers seemed to be poorly trained in the use of their weapons, often firing them “in a manner and in circumstances that place innocent bystanders in danger,” and using “dangerous and poor tactics to try to gain control of suspects.”

Justice found that Cleveland Internal Affairs does almost nothing to respond to use-of-force complaints.

In what is possibly the most shocking detail in the report, Justice found that Cleveland Internal Affairs does almost nothing to respond to use-of-force complaints. The report states, “A member of the Office of Professional Standards, which, among other duties, has been charged with investigating use of deadly force incidents, stated that the office has not reviewed a deadly force incident since 2012.”

When controversial cases arise, prosecutors rightly point out that police behavior can be inappropriate without being criminal. It isn’t their job (they might suggest) to ensure that the police are doing their jobs well.

Evidence suggests, however, that prosecutorial laxity and over-aggressive police forces tend to go together. We already know that Cleveland’s Internal Affairs office isn’t bothering much about police aggression. If prosecutors are likewise looking for ways to go easy on the police, “freak tragedies” like the death of Tamir Rice are foreseeable, not freakish.

One more detail of the DOJ’s report may be of interest. It said (to paraphrase), “Hey, didn’t we issue a report like this ten years ago? Have you done anything to address all these problems that we documented back in 2004? It doesn’t seem like it.” Interesting.

Who Should Go Down For This?

What actually happened on that fateful day in November? As usual, there are a mess of conflicting claims on the table about the incident itself. Multiple reports commissioned by the prosecutor’s office assert the shooting was reasonable. The ones commissioned by Rice’s family attorneys say it wasn’t. McGinty claims Rice was drawing his toy weapon when Loehmann fired. Another report says Rice’s hands were in his pockets and that he couldn’t have had time to draw.

This seems to imply the police can legally shoot anyone at all, provided they can piece together a remotely plausible case that they felt threatened.

Three cheers for the experts, eh? But we shouldn’t let officials hide in these ambiguities. A boy is dead, owing to massive incompetence on the part of law enforcement. And if, as McGinty has suggested, this behavior is within the bounds of the law, that would seem to imply that the police can legally shoot anyone at all, provided they can piece together a remotely plausible case that they felt threatened.

Apparently this holds even when it was unnecessary for the officers to put themselves at such close range in the first place, or if the suspect was just a seventh-grader with hands moving somewhere around his midsection.

Concerned citizens are right to be upset that this incident has resulted in no charges of any kind, against anyone. No reasonable person suggests this is first-degree murder, but is it right to dismiss even much lesser charges, such as involuntary manslaughter, or dereliction of duty? McGinty isn’t even willing to bring an indictment for one of those charges? How can we expect real police reform when prosecutors are willing to send such a clear message that, however egregious the error, no one will ever be punished?

Loehmann isn’t the only guilty party, however. There’s lots of blame to go around, which is why we should be hearing phrases like “take responsibility,” not “perfect storm of human error.” Cleveland’s justice system has real problems, and now the whole world knows it. Let’s not be satisfied until we see real movement towards reform.

Tamir Rice’s Family Should Sue Cleveland,"Based on the facts about the Tamir Rice shooting in Cleveland, here is how the incident appears to this retired, 30-year police lieutenant from near San Antonio who has trained more than a thousand police officers: An individual is waving a gun at people in the park. The police drive up to within feet of the individual and park their car.

The man with the gun reaches into his waistband for the gun, despite police orders not to do so. The whole incident is over in moments, and we all know the outcome now that a Cleveland grand jury has decided not to indict the officer who shot Rice.

I have concluded that the officers’ fear was justified and their response was reasonable, at that moment. Yet I have a problem with the officers’ approach to the event. Before officers can hope to control a situation, they must first control themselves. That didn’t happen here.

Any minor change in the overall dynamic might have led to a different outcome. Time and distance should have given the officers an advantage, but because they drove to within feet of Rice they lost that advantage. Events leading to the shooting, meaning the way the officers approached the situation, virtually guaranteed a fatal result if anything went wrong—as it did.

Sue Cleveland and Its Negligent Officers

I now urge the family to sue the hell out of the City of Cleveland and the individual officers for causing Rice’s death. Yeah, I know I sound like a liberal, holding two mutually exclusive views simultaneously.

From where I stand they would need an extension ladder to climb out of the hole they dug just to reach gross negligence.

However, there are two standards to be considered in this case. One: did the officers violate Rice’s civil rights under U.S. Code Title 42 1983? They did not. The second is: did the officers violate an ordinary standard of care, and exhibit gross negligence in the performance of their duties, in the way they responded to the call? From where I stand they would need an extension ladder to climb out of the hole they dug just to reach gross negligence.

I am not an attorney, so I have no idea where Ohio law is on tort actions. In a similar Texas case, the district judge found for the plaintiff because the officer put himself in a situation where shooting was his only option.

What I am advocating is akin to a medical malpractice-style suit after a patient went in for a vasectomy and came out with a sex change. The two might have started in the same ball park, but the results are in no way comparable.

These had to be the two stupidest cops ever to shit between police shoes to respond to this call in the manner that they chose. The only way the passenger officer could have redeemed himself is if he immediately turned and shot the driver officer for putting him in that position. These idiots need to be fired, because they are too stupid to be allowed access to anything more lethal than a rubber ball.

Here’s What Those Officers Should Have Done

I have put the cart before the horse and offered my conclusions without demonstrating my work. Okay, let me back up.

What does a ‘reasonable police officer’ versus these brain-dead clowns know?

The officers were dispatched to a man with a gun call at a city park. The caller indicated the belief that the gun may not have been real, but that was not relayed to the officers. Doesn’t matter. What does a “reasonable police officer” versus these brain-dead clowns know? (1) Approaching a guy with a gun in and of itself is not your happy place. (2) Given distance, a handgun has limited potential for accuracy. (3) The more separation between officers, the greater the chance that a rational gunman will decline the confrontation. (4) Time equals the ability to gain information. (5) Information is power. (6) Information flows both ways.

Accepting the preceding statements as reasonable, what does a reasonable police officer do? (1) Create distance between the suspected gunman and the officers. (2) Distance creates time to assess: Is this a man with a gun, or a child? (3) Distance allows officers to gain cover and concealment, which lessens the threat level and creates time. (4) Commands by police clarify to everybody involved the intent of the actors. (5) First impressions are either confirmed or denied. (6) If denied, a new round of assessment can begin.

Let’s Consider a Similar Occurrence

I found myself in a similar situation once on a Saturday night. I was flagged down and informed that a man was staggering down the street wielding a shotgun at 1:30 in the morning. The block was a location where we had arrested a man on two consecutive Saturdays as a drunk causing a disturbance.

The suspect stepped out of the shadows, ten feet from the patrol car. He did indeed have a shotgun.

The radio was so busy that I was unable to inform dispatch of the situation. I pulled into the block, still unable to inform dispatch. This is not the way to answer a “man with a gun” call, but it was the 1970s and my balls were made of brass and clanked when I walked. I popped my 870 shotgun out of the rack and started making my way to the house. As I did so, dispatch put out the man with a gun call.

When I tried to “buy the call,” my sergeant, who was riding in a two-man car, broadcast over my transmission and pulled up in front of the house. As he did so, the suspect stepped out of the shadows, ten feet from the patrol car. He did indeed have a shotgun. Fortunately, it was pointed skyward.

I racked my 870. For those who are uninitiated, there is no louder, more distinctive sound that can occur in the nighttime than the working of a Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. Once heard, that distinctive noise can never be anything but an 870. I yelled at him to “Drop the gun,” then to “Drop the fucking gun,” and he did not comply. Had I been concerned for my safety, I would have fired at that point, but since it was my sergeant I gave him a little extra time. My sergeant yelled at him to put the gun down and he did so.

There is no louder, more distinctive sound that can occur in the nighttime than the working of a Remington 870 pump-action shotgun.

This guy meant no harm to anybody. He had purchased a piece-of-shit J.C. Higgens single-shot shotgun in a bar for $35 and wanted to show it off to his cousins inside the house. He didn’t drop it because he didn’t want to mess up his new gun. The sergeant later said the only thing that kept him from coming out of the car shooting was the knowledge that I was there and had the guy covered.

In this instance, everybody screwed up to a certain degree. Nobody knew that I had responded to the call. Therefore, there was no opportunity to coordinate our response. The sergeant and his driver thought they were a block away when they parked in front of the house. On the plus side, I wasn’t threatened by the drunk with the shotgun. Had he lowered the gun in a threatening manner, I had more than enough time to shoot, and at that distance I wasn’t likely to miss. The drunk got his time. Time and permission to put the gun down was all he needed.

Well-Trained Officers Reduce the Need to Shoot

I have taught “officer survival” to thousands of police officers. One of the questions I put to officers who have shot at suspects is: “Take an inventory between those times when you have fired at suspects and those times when you could have fired at suspects and didn’t. What was different?”

You could almost see the light bulb pop on. Most officers who had been involved in shootings could recount a dozen instances where a shooting would have been justified, but they did not shoot. The answer was almost always the same: “I ran out of options,” “I had no choice,” “There was nothing else I could do.”

Applying proper tactics, personal discipline, and a basic knowledge of policing do not lead to a Tamir Rice confrontation. I would challenge any police officer with a lick of pride or integrity to contact the Cleveland Police Department and tell them that, in this instance, their officers have violated a standard of care and trust that is unacceptable to the profession. Make no mistake: This isn’t about toy guns, it is not about white cops shooting black suspects, and it isn’t even about justification.

Paul Battaglia is a retired police officer who lives near in San Antonio, Texas. As a police officer, he spent 15 years assigned to narcotics, with an additional three years as a police academy coordinator. He developed and delivered training in officer survival, tactical operations for narcotics enforcement, SWAT, and a variety of search and seizure and investigative topics. After that, he spent 12 years in patrol.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/30/tamir-rices-family-should-sue-the-police-officers-who-shot-him/,2015-12-30
You Can Support The Police And Racial Justice,"Is it rational for black men to fear they may be killed by police? The Washington Post has just released a new, groundbreaking study on police violence that may help answer that question. It investigates every fatal police shooting in the United States in 2015. You can see the data here.

Plenty of arresting details come out of this study. Those who followed the Tamir Rice case may be interested to know that realistic-looking toy guns were involved in fully 3 percent of the shootings. Almost 10 percent of victims were unarmed when they were killed, and a very disproportionate number of these were black. About a quarter of the suspects were fleeing when they were shot, while a quarter struggled with mental illness.

The headliner, though, is something we already knew: a lot of Americans get killed in police shootings. As of Christmas Eve, police in America had fatally shot 979 people across the United States. (The Guardian, with a similar study, puts the number over 1,000.)

That’s a lot, when you consider that multiple European countries can count on one hand the number of fatal police shootings each year. Every country is different, of course, in innumerable ways. Nevertheless, such enormous disparities should prompt some probing questions.

Are Cops Racist?

This of course is the question on everyone’s mind. The study won’t definitively answer it, but it may help flesh out the picture of what’s really happening in America’s more crime-ridden districts.

Some contend this data puts to rest any reasonable concern about widespread racial bias in America’s police departments. It’s true of course that young, black men are far more likely to be shot and killed by police. That’s easily explicable, however, in terms of disproportionate crime rates, and there’s no evidence that white-on-black violence is in at all disproportionate to levels of crime. David French summarizes the argument neatly as follows:

Crime doesn’t break down on neat, proportionate demographic lines. Criminals are overwhelmingly male (police killed very few women this year, but no one argues that law enforcement is sexist), and violent criminals are disproportionately black. In fact, blacks ‘commit homicide at close to eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined.’ Even worse, ‘among males between the ages of 14 and 17, the interracial homicide commission gap is nearly tenfold.’ In 2014, for example, while black Americans constituted only about 13 percent of the population, they represented a majority of the homicide and robbery arrests. 82 percent of all gun deaths in the black community are from homicide. For whites, 77 percent of gun deaths are suicides.

On face, this is a compelling argument. Blacks commit more violent crimes (dramatically more, in fact) than whites. Is it surprising they are disproportionately shot by police? If anything, racial disparities should be seen as a good sign, that police are going after the folks who are really committing crimes.

So if you’re raising a black son in America (so the logic goes), you should simply teach him to be a law-abiding citizen. That should be protection enough from the hazards of law-enforcement.

Black Lives Matter May Still Have A Point

As usual, the obvious explanation is a little too obvious. Let’s consider a slightly more nuanced explanation of the data, which may give some credence to the anxieties of Black Lives Matter, without assuming that police officers are raging bigots.

Black men really are responsible for a wildly disproportionate number of America’s homicides. In some neighborhoods, these mostly go unsolved. They are primarily committed in the context of gang rivalries, and police find these cases challenging to close, because available witnesses are too afraid to testify. (Their families live in these neighborhoods, and are liable to be targeted if witnesses come forward.)

Many of the cops who patrol these neighborhoods are really just doing their time until they can get a better assignment.

Law enforcement tends to be less aggressive about prosecuting “insider violence” (committed among mafiosos, gangsters, or members of criminal organizations). That’s readily understandable, of course. We all realize that violence is an occupational hazard of being a criminal, and most of us would agree that a police force should prioritize the safety of the law-abiding.

Still, one consequence is that the cycle of vengeance tends to continue, since gangsters have a high level of confidence they can (literally) get away with murder.

The police that work these neighborhoods are frequently undertrained and overwhelmed. There are some quiet, mostly unsung heroes who go on working the cases with few thanks, under harrowing conditions. But many of the cops who patrol these neighborhoods are really just doing their time until they can get a better assignment.

Others may care, but just not be up to the difficult task of imposing order on violence-riddled subcultures. They’re genuinely scared for their own lives. So (particularly if the climate of their department has not discouraged this) they get skittish, and sometimes make bad decisions. When guys with guns are making erratic decisions, people die.

Are Statistics Victimizing Law-Abiding Innocents?

Now, let’s return to the question of statistics. We know that lots of black men commit crimes, and that lots of black men are shot by the police. At first glance, the rough parity seems to make sense.

We needn’t see the police as racist in order to suspect that a youngster like Rice would have had better odds if he’d been white.

Thinking more about the dynamics of neighborhoods in which these shootings take place, we might want to ask more questions. Are the people getting shot the same ones who are committing crimes? The majority probably are, but remember, we’re talking about neighborhoods in which homicides are committed in large numbers, but mostly not solved, while too many officers remain undertrained and skittish.

It isn’t silly for innocent people who “look like criminals” in obvious ways (like being young, black, and male) to worry they may be at significantly greater risk of being mistaken for criminals, even if they aren’t doing anything illegal.

Taking all of this into account, we should probably be interested in the fact that unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to be fatally shot by police. Unarmed doesn’t mean innocent, of course, but that’s still a very big number.

Is it really strange that residents of high-crime neighborhoods often view the police with fear and resentment? Is it wrong for parents to feel that it might be dangerous to let their black sons play with water pistols or wear hoodies? That’s a depressing thought.

We needn’t see the police as racist in order to suspect that a youngster like Rice would have had better odds if he’d been white. That’s a grim thought, too.

More Resources and Higher Standards

Let’s be clear. An 18-year-old black man is in far more danger than I am of being shot by the police. That likely holds even if we’re standing on the same street corner, behaving the same way. At the same time, black men are far more likely to be shot by other black men than by cops.

We should be bothered by a justice climate that leaves even law-abiding blacks feeling personally threatened, with some justification.

Those two facts are related. Insofar as police make bad mistakes, that’s largely because they’re being asked to tackle big problems with limited resources. They deserve to be cut some slack (though, crucially, not an infinite amount).

We don’t have to choose between a pro-police stance and a pro-racial-justice stance. We should support law enforcement and the rights of minorities. Even if we agree that most police officers probably aren’t personally bigoted, we should be bothered by a justice climate that leaves even law-abiding blacks feeling personally threatened, with some justification.

It’s a problem, and instead of mulling over the complexities of moral responsibility, we should be looking for ways to address it. The most obvious conclusion is that we should invest more resources in better-quality law enforcement in high-crime areas.

Real police reform is going to involve a lot of tit-for-tat. Raise salaries, so police forces can recruit talent more aggressively, and push for merit-based pay scales that reward the sorts of officers who do useful and needed things (de-escalating tense neighborhood situations, closing homicides). Invest more in training programs that help officers learn to defuse tense situations, and to keep themselves safe without using excessive force.

Law-abiding Americans should be able to move safely through public spaces, regardless of what they look like.

At the same time, strip union contracts of provisions that hinder Internal Affairs divisions from investigating use-of-force complaints. (If you think this will frighten talented people away from policing, consider that juries in general are very sympathetic to cops, even despite the public relations fiascos of the past few years. They are reluctant to convict cops unless the abuse of power is truly egregious.)

If you’re wondering where the money will come from to pay for these improvements, consider that both crime and incarceration are very expensive. By reducing both, effective policing tends to pay for itself.

Raise transparency with body and dashboard cameras, and respond seriously to complaints of low-level police bullying. Think of this as the flip side of the “broken window” theory: bully cops can do far more damage to the force’s reputation than immediate ramifications might suggest.

Crucially, we must get away from using the police as a major source of revenue. As Ferguson, Missouri, clearly shows us, pressuring cops to act as your niggling tax-collectors is not worth it given the cost in public resentment and reduced police effectiveness.

Law-abiding Americans should be able to move safely through public spaces, regardless of what they look like. Black kids shouldn’t have to get tutorials from their parents about staying safe from cops. Shouldn’t we all be able to agree on these things? Let’s support our police by giving them the resources they need, and demanding that they be the good guys.

11 Things Obama Never Cried About,"While announcing executive actions to further restrict gun sales on Tuesday, President Obama became emotional when recounting the children who died during the Sandy Hook shooting.

This very public display of emotion surprised many, as Obama doesn’t cry in public very often. In fact, he has a reputation of being rather stoic and emotionless.

“Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,” he said as he brushed away tears.

Over the past seven years, there have been numerous tragedies he didn’t publicly shed a tear over, including the deaths of black men and children at the hands of police officers.

Here are 11 other things that Obama never (publicly) cried about.

1. Laquan McDonald’s death

Obama’s hometown of Chicago has been rife with tension after police shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald then apparently colluded with city officials in an attempt to conceal details surrounding his death. Many were upset that the dashcam footage showing a police officer fatally shooting the teen was released to the public 13 months after the October 2014 shooting. The delay in releasing the video raised suspicions that Rahm Emanuel, Chicago mayor and Obama’s former chief of staff, was involved in covering up the police’s actions surrounding his death.

A deluge of emails from city officials show that the Emanuel administration was concerned about the optics of the shooting, and it appears that they tried to minimize attention to the tragic event. The emails, which total over 3,000 pages, were made available to the public on New Year’s Eve.

While Obama did release a statement saying that he was “deeply disturbed” by the footage, he hasn’t publicly shed tears over a police officer shooting this teenager 16 times even after McDonald had already fallen to the ground. Nor has he claimed to have lost sleep over the subsequent cover-up that his former pal seems to have participated in.

2. Tamir Rice’s Death

Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was shot to death while playing with a toy gun at a park in November 2014. The police officer who shot Rice has been cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but video footage showing the child’s death is truly horrifying.

3. Eric Garner’s Death

Eric Garner was choked to death by police last year while they apprehended him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Though he was resisting arrest, Garner can be heard repeatedly saying: “I can’t breathe.”

4. San Bernardino Attack

Obama was so undisturbed by the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 that he waited two weeks before he finally making a pit stop at the site of the tragedy before taking off on his vacation to Hawaii.

5. Paris Terror Attacks

In the wake of the attacks that killed 130 people, Obama said climate change negotiations would be a “powerful rebuke” to ISIS — the terror group claiming responsibility for the carnage. While standing alongside President Francois Hollande to give a joint press conference on the attacks, Obama’s eyes remained dry, even as he embraced the leader of the country that had just suffered a great loss.

6. Fort Hood Massacre

Thirteen American soldiers were shot to death in Fort Hood, Texas, by an Army major who was repeatedly promoted despite continual warnings that he had become radicalized. Before opening fire in a processing center, he shouted “Allahu Akbar,” an Arabic phrase often used by jihadists that means “God is great.”

While Obama denounced the shooter’s actions, he had avoided publicly calling the shooter’s actions “terrorism” until a few weeks ago, six years after the fact.

7. Planned Parenthood’s Baby Butchery and Organ Harvesting

Employees of the nation’s largest abortion provider, which aborted over 300,000 babies last year, were caught on tape mutilating and picking through dead baby bodies to find sellable organs.

Other Planned Parenthood officials haggled over the price of organs and some were caught attempting to minimize the public attention to their organ-harvesting scheme for fear of bad press.

If the death of 26 children was enough to warrant a tearful response in public from the president, certainly the 300,000 babies who were aborted last year by Planned Parenthood deserve to be mourned as well.

8. Kayla Mueller’s Kidnapping and Death

The 27-year-old American aid worker was killed earlier this year while in captivity to ISIS. Despite having her fingernails ripped out and being raped repeatedly, Mueller refused to escape with some of her fellow hostages because she was reportedly afraid that her foreign appearance would inhibit their escape.

Mueller isn’t the only woman to be forced into the role of a sex slave to ISIS. The terror group has reportedly kidnapped thousands of women and girls for the purpose of raping and exchanging them with one another. They released a fatwa last month regulating the practice of sex slavery and rape in order to justify it with their beliefs, which are rooted in a radical interpretation of the Quran.

9. James Foley’s Beheading

Not only did Obama not cry when responding to the news of American journalist James Foley’s beheading by ISIS, he immediately ran off to play a round of golf. When he was confronted about this rather aloof behavior, Obama responded by saying that he “should have anticipated the optics” of playing golf immediately after condemning ISIS’ brutal actions.

The terror group is known for killing their prisoners in particularly inhumane ways, like lighting them on fire, drowning them in cages, or strapping explosive collars around their necks.

10. ISIS’s Attack on a Russian Plane Carrying 224 Passengers

A Russian plane carrying 224 passengers crashed earlier this year, killing everyone onboard. U.S. authorities believe ISIS planted a bomb on the plane. Don’t panic, though: Obama says he is taking the whole thing “very seriously.”

11. Boko Haram’s Kidnapping of More than 300 Girls

Radical Islamist terrorist organization Boko Haram kidnapped more than 300 girls from a school in Nigeria in order to enslave and sell them as sex slaves last year. While the kidnapping and trafficking of hundreds of girls got Michelle Obama to use the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls in a cringe-worthy photo op, it did not elicit any tears from the president.

How To Stop Police Problems Before They Become Shootings,"Rahm Emanuel is a liar who is eyeball-deep in corruption. He almost certainly used $5 million of taxpayers’ money to pay off the family of a murdered teenager, for the sake of preserving his political campaign. We can’t prove this. Everyone knows that it’s true.

Here are some other unpleasant facts everyone knows (at least if they’re paying attention). Chicago is drowning in debt and corruption. It’s a sinkhole of crime and cronyism, and the police have been riddled with problems, quite literally, for decades.

As with so many “everyone knows” problems, there are ways to fix this. Emanuel’s resignation would be a good start. (Sorry, but a lying apology is just an insult to all of us.) But that’s really just the beginning. The Chicago PD needs some serious restructuring. With marchers demanding action and the feds moving in, will things finally improve? That may be up to the people of Chicago.

Let’s Talk About Chicago’s Police Problem

It’s serious. That’s been clear to interested observers for a long, long time. It’s painful to say this, because I’m sure Chicago has many dedicated officers who are trying very hard to protect the public in difficult circumstances. Here’s the harsh truth, though. If the Chicago Police Department makes the news, the story is either unflattering or literally unbelievable.

The Chicago PD decided to leave certain murders unsolved and unpunished, for the sake of juking the stats.

Chicago’s reputation for police brutality goes back some years. We were recently reminded of this when the city offered millions in “reparations” to torture victims who suffered at the hands of Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge’s infamous “midnight crew.” Burge is a particularly dark spot in Chicago’s police history, but the list of “indiscretions” goes on (and on and on).

This year the department has been hit with a lawsuit from two officers who claim they were harassed, demoted, and deliberately put in danger for working with Internal Affairs, trying to catch corrupt cops who were believed to be taking kickbacks from drug dealers. A 20-year police veteran issued an affidavit corroborating their claims.

In what appears to be good news, Chicago has been boasting that its crime rates are finally (and very suddenly!) dropping. They credit CompStat, a widely hailed crime-control system that has had impressive results in New York City.

If that sounds a little too good to be true, that’s probably because it is. Chicago Magazine has documented evidence that the city, desperate to reverse its reputation as a hotbed of violent crime, was massaging the stats, most likely with encouragement from Emanuel. Multiple homicides appear to have been reclassified on various spurious grounds. In other words, the Chicago PD decided to leave certain murders unsolved and unpunished, for the sake of juking the stats.

Corruption Is No Secret

I’ll tell you a secret. Police corruption really isn’t so secret. Sometimes the details can be difficult to obtain. That’s aggravating for Internal Affairs, because unlike, say, your corner drug dealers, dirty politicians and ranking police officials have good lawyers, and powerful friends. You need a strong case to bring them down.

Statistics can give us a reasonably good sense of which departments have corruption and abuse-of-power issues.

If you’re looking for the big picture, though, you don’t need a security clearance to see it. Statistics can give us a reasonably good sense of which departments have corruption and abuse-of-power issues.

For the semi-informed public, particular high-profile cases end up looming large in our imagination. Was Michael Brown going for the gun when he was shot? Was Jamar Clark really handcuffed on the ground? What really happened to Freddie Gray?

Everybody loves a good whodunit, but realistically, the details of these particular cases may or may not tell us anything interesting about policing, poverty, or urban crime. Some police shootings are justified. On other occasions, bad cops do reprehensible things, for which they should be punished.

It’s a given that both things do happen in America; our interest should be in ensuring that the latter kind of incident is rare, and strongly discouraged by law enforcement’s structure and ethos. But when the details of a handful of cases radically form public opinion, we’re likely to end up with a badly distorted picture. It’s as if we decided to gauge the state of public health by yanking five people off the street and giving them physicals.

Signs A Police Department Is Corrupt

What does it look like when a police department develops an unhealthy culture that permits abuses of power? For a disturbing peek, consider this recent story from The Guardian, documenting the troubles of Kern County, California, where 13 of the 875,000 residents were fatally shot by police over this past year. By contrast, the Big Apple had only nine fatal police shootings in the same period of time, although it has ten times as many residents and 23 times as many cops.

The Big Apple had only nine fatal police shootings in the same period of time, although it has ten times as many residents and 23 times as many cops.

Of course, statistical trends can’t definitively prove anything. Perhaps Kern County is home to an unusually aggressive band of desperadoes (though if so, it doesn’t show up in its homicide rate, which is right around the national average). But if I were a resident of Kern County, I’d want to know why, in comparison to a member of the New York Police Department, a cop in my county is exponentially more likely to use deadly force.

Our analysis needn’t end there, of course. Blogging at the Washington Post, Radley Balko notes there is a troubling statistical correlation between counties with an unusually high number of death sentences, and counties that have disproportionate numbers of fatal police shootings. “It isn’t difficult to see,” Balko suggests, “how when a DA takes a ‘win at all costs’ approach to fighting crime, that philosophy would permeate an entire county’s law enforcement apparatus, from the beat cop to the DA herself or himself.”

Balko’s observations point to a broader truth the concerned public should remember. Specific cases can raise troubling epistemic questions as the public decides whether to trust the conflicting claims of cops and bystanders. But we needn’t be paralyzed by the ambiguities of a particular he-said-she-said situation, because there are a number of telltale signs that help indicate when law enforcement is sliding into lawlessness.

Digging into the numbers, we can see that police departments and courts vary widely throughout the country. These differences aren’t necessarily explicable in terms of disparate crime rates. Sub-cultures develop within the justice system, such that some counties respect due process far more than others.

When people move into a new neighborhood, they tend to ask about the schools, parks, and pollution rates. Does anyone ask about the number of fatal police shootings, or the percentage of court cases that end in plea bargains? Probably not. But maybe they should.

Support Real Reform, Not Just ‘Community Policing’

Let’s say your county has a police brutality problem. What can you do about it? What changes would actually help?

When city officials talk about improving their police departments, you’re liable to hear the term “community policing” repeated ad nauseum. It’s the perfect buzzword. Most people aren’t sure what it means, but it seems to speak to what they want: the kind of police who will serve the community instead of harassing and bullying.

Like most buzzwords, ‘community policing’ is a nebulous term that can cover a multitude of sins.

Like most buzzwords, “community policing” is a nebulous term that can cover a multitude of sins. Pretty much every department in the country already claims to do it, so clearly the term doesn’t tell you much about the facts on the ground. Don’t give politicians any points for pumping “community policing.”

A reform-minded politician should have a lot to say about transparency. But don’t give people too much credit for using that word, either. You should be hearing words like “body cameras” and “public access.” The real badge of honor goes to the man willing to utter the name of the sacred cow: unions.

Police unions pose a huge obstacle to transparency, consistently opposing transparency measures and often negotiating contracts with measures to protect officers from thorough investigations.

Campaign Zero, in one of its more sensible initiatives, has combed through many police union contracts looking for these clauses. They’ve found such fishy measures as: “waiting periods” requiring investigators to let the evidence against accused officers go cold for two days before documenting anything, measures to slim down the range of civilian complaints that can be investigated, and requirements that complaints against officers be purged every two years.

It’s true, of course, that policemen sometimes need to use force on the job. No one wants to see cowardly departments hang good cops out to dry. But how can it reasonably serve the cause of justice to hobble investigation in this way?

Despite their general hatred of public-sector unions, conservatives have long had a soft spot for police unions, because conservatives respect the law. Chicago shows us what can happen when the guys with the guns aren’t held accountable for what they do.

Go for Transparency

Not every police operation can be completely transparent. Ironically, though, some of the latest research suggests that crime control is often more effective when police are upfront about their activities and enforcement priorities. When would-be criminals know that police are cracking down on particular offenses, they’re liable to modify their behavior to avoid being caught red-handed. That can make it easier for police to address the problems that are a community’s highest priorities.

Crime control is often more effective when police are upfront about their activities and enforcement priorities.

The bottom line is that citizens shouldn’t be satisfied with a police force that uses security concerns as an excuse for keep the public at arm’s length. In general, law enforcement is more successful when the police have an open, working relationship with the communities they serve.

In many contexts, conservatives are energized by security concerns. We’re interested in military questions, and deeply invested in our Second Amendment rights. We tend to feel (rightly!) that it’s our responsibility to be vigilant about ensuring adequate protection for our children and other vulnerable citizens.

Good policing, however, is just as critical to keeping our neighborhoods and families safe. To get it, we need to support our local law enforcement while also demanding that they be held to high standards. Chicago should serve as a reminder of what can happen when we fail to watch the watchers.

Steven Avery Is Guilty As Hell,"This entire post is one long, griping spoiler.

Steven Avery, the subject of the hit Netflix documentary “Making a Murderer,” is currently serving a life sentence for the gruesome killing of 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach, whose remains were found in a fire pit on his property in Wisconsin. What makes the documentary so fascinating — and hopefully you’re already aware of this — is that Avery had previously spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. The bulk of the un-narrated documentary focuses on what defense lawyers propose is questionable conduct by police and prosecutors, many of whom, we’re supposed to believe, framed Avery for the crime in an attempt to save their own reputations and the town from fiscal calamity.

I was convinced of many things watching the 10-part series: I was convinced the criminal justice system and Manitowoc County were likely corrupt, and that many people in that office wanted to see Avery end up back in jail. I was convinced that I was being manipulated by directors Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos (more on this later). I was definitely convinced that Avery was guilty of the murder. And, believe it or not, a viewer could believe all those things simultaneously.

But I feel like I’m in the minority on this. There are now petitions on Change.org and WhiteHouse.gov asking for Obama to pardon Avery (he can’t) that have collected, as of this writing, more than 300,000 signatures. This is utterly absurd.

The DNA evidence exonerating Avery for the rape of a jogger in 1985 did not make him incapable of committing murder (maybe it was his time in prison that transformed Avery into a killer; the documentary doesn’t tell us much about those 18 years in prison, though surely they were traumatic). Yet, it seems that many idealistic viewers want to transfer their anger about the initial miscarriage of justice — and a general distrust of the police — to the new case and use it as reasonable doubt, despite the preponderance of evidence.

Here are some basic things we know right now:

Parts of Halbach’s body were found burned in Avery’s fire pit.

Evidence of Avery’s involvement was found inside his home.

There is DNA evidence tying the bullet found in the Avery garage to Halbach.

Avery was the last known person to see Halbach alive.

Police found her car, with blood on it and in it, left on the Avery family’s lot.

Avery’s high-school age cousin nephew, Brendan Dassey, confessed that he had assisted his uncle in murder of Halbach.*

Now, to believe Avery is innocent, a person must believe that an implausible number of conspiracies had been unfurled in the case: for starters, the placing of the car, the blood, the body, the keys, and all other evidence. The cover up would have included two DAs and a large group of cops in two police departments. And while it’s not improbable that some of those involved might be morally capable of setting up Avery, Dean Strang (now a sex symbol) and Jerome Buting offered no evidence that anyone had done so, only accusations.

But beyond all that, here are just a few items that the producers of “Making a Murderer” decided to leave out that make the case less riveting and Avery more sympathetic:

— Not only was the bullet found in the garage linked to Halbach’s DNA, but it was forensically tied to Avery’s gun as well. Seems like a pertinent thing for viewers to know. To believe Avery was innocent, you now have to believe that forensics specialists were in on the frame-up and lied about both the DNA and gun, or messed up both tests.

— The criminal complaint claimed that authorities had found restraints — handcuffs and leg irons — at Avery’s residence. In 2006, Avery admitted to buying them so he could use them on his then-girlfriend. This alone doesn’t mean Avery is the killer of course, but it does lend credence to the description offered by Dassey and the police. We heard nothing about this during the show.

— The infamous car key that was found in Avery’s residence had DNA of his sweat on it. So not only are we asked to believe the Manitowoc police department planted the keys in his trailer (and that the neighboring police force was either incompetent or complicit in the deception), but also that somehow the cops had extracted Avery’s perspiration and put it on the key. Another explanation might be that Avery handled the keys when dealing with Halbach, although he denies having ever seen them.

Which bring up additional question: If Avery’s defenders are convinced that DNA from one pubic hair completely exonerates him in the rape case, why does DNA evidence in this case not prove his guilt?

— Avery not only called Auto Trader and specifically requested Halbach to take pictures the day she was killed, but he also gave a false name when he did so. Why? And why would he, and the documentarians, fail to mention it? Avery then called Halbach’s cell phone three times the day she died, twice using *67 to obscure his identity. None of this proves his guilt, but all of these actions undermine the defense’s contention that Halbach was just someone that happened to come by that day for a job. It sounds like he wanted her to come by. None of this is mentioned in the documentary.

— Not only was Avery’s blood — which we’re supposed to believe was planted by the police after being extracted from an evidence room — found in six places on Halbach’s vehicle, but DNA from his sweat was also found on a hood latch. How did it get there? Did the police have a vial of perspiration ready to go the day of the murder?

— You’d also have to be gullible to believe that Avery was merely a flawed, but good-hearted victim of unfortunate circumstance once you learn more about his history. According to an Appleton Post Crescent article from 2006, Avery planned the fantasy torture and killing of a young woman while in prison. According to Ken Kratz at least, Avery also drew up plans for torture chambers while in prison. True? We don’t know. The documentary never mentions (or disproves) any of these accusations.

The young Avery didn’t unintentionally set fire to a cat, as “Making a Murderer” suggests, but poured gasoline on the animal and then threw it into a bonfire, according the Associated Press. And Avery didn’t only threaten a female cousin at gunpoint, an incident the documentary portrays as the unfortunate actions of an immature teen, but is also alleged to have raped a young girl and threatened to kill her family if they spoke out, according another story in Post Crescent (paywalled). If we’re to believe Dassey’s conversations with police, Avery had also molested his cousins. “I even told them about Steven touching me,” Dassey explains to his mother after one of the interviews with police.

Now, we don’t know if all or any of these accusations are true. But we do know that the documentary didn’t offer viewers the full picture of Avery’s purported behavior and ugly proclivities. Yet, the same filmmakers had no problem bringing up Kratz’s sexting scandal and other unpleasant tidbits about the prosecution and police, though they had nothing to do with the case itself.

Why would Avery leave the keys in his room? Why would he leave the vehicle in his lot? Who would be that stupid? He had to be set up. I hear this defense often. Well, maybe Avery is not very bright. Maybe Avery didn’t have time to rid himself of the evidence. Who cares? Whether he was smart enough to mastermind a murder or whether he once faced an injustice of the system, doesn’t change the facts of this case. Maybe if I was on the jury I would see things differently. My judgement is made solely on the evidence available to me as a viewer. Maybe we’ll hear new evidence moving forward that changes all of this, but “Making a Murderer,” much like “Serial” before it, is a work of advocacy journalism.

I’m not sure there is anything wrong with advocacy, as this is still a compelling look at the families of the victims and suspects and their experience in the American justice system, but we shouldn’t pretend that it’s something else.

*For me the matter of Dassey’s confession was the most problematic part of the case. The police interviews with him were almost unwatchable at times. The detectives’ questioning of Dassey (and describing what they did as “questioning” is far too charitable) without an attorney or family member present, despite the kid’s obviously low IQ, was abuse. Kratz’s press conference misrepresenting the tenor and outcome of that confession was nothing more than a lie. Yet, it needs to be pointed out that Dassey’s confession was far more specific than his other stories and comported with evidence that turned up.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/01/06/making-a-murderer-subject-steven-avery-is-guilty-as-hell/,2016-01-06
Rahm Emanuel To Headline Conference On Distrust Of Police,"Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, currently under fire for covering up the murder of a black teen by police, is set to headline a national conference panel on how to reduce violence and make people trust police. Emanuel’s scheduled appearance at a national meeting of mayors was announced by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in a press release Tuesday morning.

“Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will participate in a panel discussion on Reducing Violence and Strengthening Policy/Community Trust at the top of the Opening Plenary Session on Wednesday, January 20,” the press release boasts.

Emanuel is currently fighting for his political life after his administration covered up the murder of Laquan McDonald by police in order to protect Emanuel’s political reputation in the midst of a heated Democratic primary in 2015. Emanuel and his top staff, who agreed to settle a multi-million dollar wrongful death suit brought by McDonald’s family, suppressed video of the shooting for months. The video did not become public until a judge ordered its release. The same day the video was finally released, the police officer shown on film shooting McDonald while he was on the ground was charged with murder.

Various news reports following the court-ordered release of the dashcam video showing Laquan McDonald’s murder indicate that Emanuel and his top staff were well aware of what it showed when they agreed to pay McDonald’s family $5 million to drop its lawsuit against the city of Chicago. In drafts of the settlement agreement, Rahm Emanuel’s lawyers even tried to get Laquan McDonald’s family to agree to keep the dashcam video secret until Emanuel was no longer in office:

Emanuel had maintained since McDonald’s death that he has never seen the dash-cam video, but the emails prove the mayor knew exactly what the footage showed when city lawyers negotiated a deal that would at least delay the video’s release. Attorneys for McDonald’s estate sent Platt screenshots of the video and a detailed description:



“After Laquan immediately spun to the ground, graphic puffs of smoke from ricochet shots establishes that Officer Van Dyke continued to fire his weapon for approximately 16 seconds after Mr. McDonald laid helplessly in the street.”



Emanuel’s lawyers were offering $5 million in hush money to keep this hidden just weeks before the runoff election. And the biggest part of the deal—that McDonald family attorneys agreed to keep the video to themselves until criminal proceedings were concluded—just so happened to be inked the day after Emanuel was re-elected.

The Latest ‘Batman’ Doesn’t Depict Police Brutality,"Last fall “Batman #44” hit the comic book stands, and a number of voices, including its authors Scott Snyder and Brian Azzarello, claimed it was an attempt to address the intersection of police brutality and gentrification or, more bluntly, that Batman was confronting institutionalized police racism. Some even noted the story holds “white readers accountable for their complicity in the real-world situations that the comic analogises.” But is that really the case?

The main point of this contention comes from the idea that Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) Officer Ned Howler shot dead a young African-American boy, Peter Duggio. However, Snyder and Azzarello confirm on the third page of the book the boy was not killed by gunfire. In Batman’s own words, “I’d agree if the shots had killed him. But I scanned him. He died from a fall. Dropped here. From about a thousand feet up.”

The book does confirm Howler shot and wounded Duggio, but the context in which the shooting occurs disputes the idea that this issue delves into institutionalized police racism. Instead, this book examines Duggio’s terrible choices and crimes.

It’s Not Clear the Police Were Especially at Fault

The first of those mistakes was turning to the crime-lord Penguin to protect his bodega from Penguin’s rivals, the Four Fives gang. The Four Fives gang had been moving in on the store after Bruce Wayne’s announcement he would redevelop the entire neighborhood where it was located. Penguin accepted Duggio’s deal and took control of the bodega; except, once he took control, he gifted the property to the Four Fives gang to end their feud.

Duggio got in bed with criminals, and he paid the price. However, this didn’t sit well with him. He decided to enact his own vengeance, storming the bodega and picking a fight with the Four Fives, even setting the store ablaze. This gang fight and blaze sent Officer Howler down to the neighborhood to restore order. Upon Ned’s arrival at the fire, Duggio exited the building. Duggio was bent over, one hand on his head; the other was by his waist out of the officer’s sight. Howler asked Duggio to get on the ground twice before he ended up opening fire.

It is hardly cause to be claiming Batman is confronting institutionalized racism or even claiming the GCPD is racist.

Was Howler right in shooting an arson suspect and supposed gang member who might have been going for a gun? Snyder believes, “You want Batman to beat this officer up, and be like, ‘How could you?’” However, this is not an emotion I experienced at all. I’m not even sure Officer Howler did anything wrong. He ordered an arsonist to get on the ground twice before firing, although his decision to pull the trigger was hasty.

Snyder does acknowledge that continued violence against Howler “wouldn’t solve the problem. Batman throwing the officer off a roof or throwing the officer in jail, it wouldn’t get to the heart of the matter at all.” While I agree that having Batman throw Howler off a roof wouldn’t solve the problem, I find it difficult to comprehend his suggestion about jail time failing to. If individuals commit a crime, they should be punished accordingly, and prison might not be a terrible solution. In this specific case, I do not believe Howler was in the wrong.

This event is also just one specific example of a police officer shooting an African-American. It is hardly cause to be claiming Batman is confronting institutionalized racism or even claiming the GCPD is racist. For one, Howler’s actions are hardly racist. He responded to a crime in progress and shot a suspect who had failed to heed his multiple warnings. The comic does include newspaper clippings hinting at a significant number of officer-involved shootings of black individuals. However, it does not provide any context about the reasons for the shootings.

This ‘Batman’ Doesn’t Rip Gentrification, Either

Now that the myth of Batman confronting police brutality in “Batman #44” has been dispelled, let’s examine the idea that he is also confronting gentrification. He is in fact not confronting it, but could be promoting it. Towards the end of the book, Bruce Wayne announces plans to renovate Duggio’s neighborhood, providing an infusion of capital and creating Wayne Apartments with upscale living conditions.

Azzarello used his experience with a public housing project in Chicago to influence his ideas on gentrification within the book.

The idea that Snyder and Azzarello believe gentrification is wrong comes from a newspaper clipping within the book stating, “Wayne Apartments…might drive up property values and force out longtime residents.” However, the article also notes Wayne Apartments will be “designed to provide upscale living conditions for lower-middle class families in the Corner.” Thus, Bruce Wayne and Wayne Enterprises might actually be building these new homes to help the people already living there. It is unclear what the actual process will be to find tenants.

Even if Wayne isn’t aiming at providing better accommodations for the current residents, gentrification isn’t some vile or evil act. Economist Walter Block notes that property owners like Duggio “will have so much money thrust down their throats that they will prefer their new digs to their old ones. Otherwise, they will stay put, and not be ‘run out of town’ by the newcomers.” Unfortunately, Peter chose to make deals with criminals like the Penguin instead of bankers and investors who might be interested in his property.

In the case of renters, opposing gentrification is “an attack on the marketplace.” It would mean that bidding for goods in general is wrong. Block also argues that gentrification does not mean a landlord can keep tenants within his building, restricting their ability to move freely. In a similar argument, one does not have the right to another’s property; landlords are free to do with their property as they will.

Peter chose to make deals with criminals like the Penguin instead of bankers and investors who might be interested in his property.

Azzarello used his experience with a public housing project in Chicago to influence his ideas on gentrification within the book. The problem is that Chicago and Gotham have two different issues. In Gotham, Bruce Wayne, a private citizen, announces a planned redevelopment using his own finances. In contrast, Chicago turns to the government to alleviate poverty with welfare. The Cato Institute’s Michael Tanner discusses how government welfare leads to increased poverty and how Wayne’s charitable actions are able to “individualize approaches and can target the specific problems that are holding people in poverty.”

In conclusion, Duggio’s own actions bring on the real-world situation analogized in the story. He made his choices, and they involved making deals with criminals, assaulting another individual, and committing arson. “White readers” are not responsible or complicit for the actions another individual takes. “Batman #44” also shows the tough and dangerous position many law enforcement officers face while on the job—not to mention how criminalizing drugs can lead to crime and violence, but that is an article for another day.

Were Katie Couric’s Shady Guns Actually Destroyed By Police?,"The new claim by Katie Couric’s documentary producer Stephanie Soechtig that guns she arranged to purchase in Arizona have been destroyed is in conflict with Arizona law that protects such public property once it is turned over to police.

In a frantic effort to cover her tracks and “make good” on a failed attempt to paint gun owners in an ignorant light, Couric and her producer Stephanie Soechtig and team have apparently committed conspiracy and multiple federal felonies. Buying firearms privately without paperwork or background checks across state lines violates federal statute (18 USC §922 et seq.). Private sales among law-abiding resident adults within a state such as Arizona are perfectly legal under most conditions since no criminal activity is involved. Couric’s team reportedly came from outside the state to commit the acts. Some observers believe the laws Couric could be charged under are unjust and should be repealed.

Couric’s team has now claimed the firearms they bought, with videotape evidence of the purchase (the exact number of guns purchased is now disputed by the team’s own changing accounts), have been destroyed by police. The generic term “police” could refer to numerous state and federal agencies, which have not been clearly identified. But it would appear impossible for these firearms to have been destroyed, as Couric’s team claims.

For one thing, no agency in Arizona operates that swiftly. This appears to be simply a fantasy of left-wing gun hatred—instantaneous destruction of things they don’t like, as if pestilence is upon the land and authorities can somehow step in and simply eradicate it. Police don’t track and notify anyone of such actions.

As a practical matter, Arizona authorities gather firearms they receive, hold them in a property office, and through a long, deliberate court-involved process decide what the proper disposition of the goods should be. When firearms are in useable condition, they are very often recycled and used by the agency that received them. The Bushmaster rifle Couric’s team obtained, highly prized by police (though vilified in Couric’s report) is a candidate for salvation.

In this case, however, the relinquished guns are evidence in possible felony offenses, so it defies credulity and common sense to assume they were simply destroyed because Couric or her producer would like them to be, as they have claimed they are.

But it gets worse than speculation for the beleaguered filmmakers, whose falsified “documentary” has besmirched their reputations and hurt journalistic credibility in general following the original story broken by the AmmoLand.com website with evidence from the Virginia Citizens Defense League.

Objecting to the wanton destruction of expensive public property, which firearms become once they fall into officials’ hands, Arizona enacted legislation in 2013 to prevent exactly this sort of counterproductive behavior and loss of assets.

In the law commonly referred to as the Protection of Firearms in Official Custody act, property was redefined to include any guns that might come into officials’ possession for any reason. According to The Arizona Gun Owner’s Guide (26th Edition), they must be safely kept, honestly valued, and handled only as defined by law. If officials take a gun from you, they must give you a detailed receipt, including how to retrieve it. Couric and her team would have gotten such receipts and instructions, or something is amiss, including their statements about destruction. This calls for further investigation of both the receiving agency and Couric’s team.

If a gun that is legal to own and worth more than $150 is found and the owner is not known, a description of it must be publicly posted or published. It’s not clear if these firearms—contraband if they were indeed bought illegally—would be classified as “found” by police. If a found gun is unclaimed after 30 days, the gun can be sold to a licensed firearm dealer for resale to the public, or a law-enforcement agency can trade it to a licensed dealer for anything it needs for its own work.

In a sale, the money goes to the general fund. In a trade, the police get the goods. Either way, the firearms become available to the public through FBI background-checked sales, not melted down or ground into dust. See Arizona Revised Statutes §12-940 et seq. and §13-3108 for the statutes.

Firearms acquired by various agencies, a public asset in the hands of our government servants, can no longer be destroyed, under this law carefully amended to prevent ongoing abuse of constitutionally protected property.

As a result, Couric’s and Soechtig’s troubles may have only just begun.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/07/were-katie-courics-shady-guns-actually-destroyed-by-police/,2016-06-07
Everyone Should Support Police Accountability,"This has been a tough week for American police. They’re learning the hard way that in today’s world, the cell phone is mightier than the gun.

Someone Is Always Watching

First, there was Alton Sterling. He made a small living trafficking in illegal goods – specifically, bootleg CDs. In the small hours of Tuesday morning, the Baton Rouge police put a stop to it. A widely-circulated cell phone video shows police forcing him to the ground and restraining him. Resistance is minimal; he clearly isn’t planning to put up a fight. Then, the officer further away from the camera shouts something about a gun. The closer officer draws his weapon, pauses for a sickening moment as if contemplating what to do, and shoots the restrained man at point-blank range.

If you can watch this video without expletives, you’re more civilized than I am.

The hits keep coming. Last night, here in my own Twin Cities, 32-year-old Philando Castile was fatally shot by the St Anthony Police Department. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, narrates the incident live on her cell phone, projecting a remarkable calm as she explains how she and Castile were pulled over for a broken tail light. According to Diamond, Castile was a licensed carrier, and warned the officer in advance that he had a gun on his person, but was only reaching for the requested documents. She pans the cell phone over to show Castile, who is drenched in blood. According to her narration, he was shot four times. We never see the officer’s face, but the drawn weapon is still visible through the passenger window as she speaks.

We don’t have official forensic reports on either of these events. This is especially significant in Castile’s case, since the video doesn’t actually show the shooting. Let’s not kid ourselves, though. This looks incredibly bad.

How interesting that these tragedies would occur just as conservatives were launching into a fresh round of indignation over the “war on cops”.

Is There A War On Cops?

Conservatives like cops. We’re law and order people, so we need to believe that the good guys are the ones with the badges. We’re anxious to do our part to protect the boys in blue from race-baiting liberals and delusional social justice warriors.

This summer, the trendy conservative phrases have been “Ferguson Effect” and “the war on cops”. Both can be traced back to Heather Mac Donald, whose newly-released book argues that cops are policing cities less aggressively, in response to negative publicity from liberal politicians and social justice warriors. That laxity, Mac Donald argues, has had some dire consequences, most notably a spike in homicides across several American cities.

It’s slightly odd for a longtime police apologist like Mac Donald to paint cops as such a sensitive and highly-strung crowd. It’s true that police officers have been more scrutinized of late, and particular politicians and pundits have made unreasonable accusations. Still, actual police fatalities have been at historic lows over the past few years, and while the number of indictments has ticked up slightly, exceedingly few are ever convicted for on-duty fatalities. Given the sacrifices they’ve made, cops do deserve a margin of error, as well as some benefit of the doubt when the evidence surrounding a fatal shooting is inconclusive. The evidence suggests, though, that they’re already getting that, which makes it hard to justify the sort of widespread laxity in law enforcement that would provoke a “Ferguson effect” crime spike.

Despite this, Mac Donald seems to think that we should address policing problems by redoubling our full-voiced support for the boys in blue. Only when cops feel fully and unambiguously supported can we expect to see good policing, and safer neighborhoods.

Corruptio Optimi Pessima

Policing is an honorable profession. A cop is a person who has volunteered to put his own safety on the line to protect yours. That’s impressive, and we should respect it.

Here’s the thing about honorable professions, though. When people are entrusted with noble and good work, it’s always possible that they might betray that trust. The consequences of that betrayal can be very ugly indeed. In the words of the ancients, corruptio optimi pessima. The corruption of the best produces the worst.

When a profession commands our respect, we often feel tempted to “virtue-cloak” it, insisting against all opposition that members of that profession really are what we know they should be. This is a natural impulse, especially in a fractious society where political narratives dominate public life. We understand how easily cops can become scapegoats for progressive liberals with an agenda. They deal daily with the grim effects of social breakdown, and when those confrontations take a tragic turn, liberals would much rather blame the “racist” police than acknowledge the bitter fruits of the sexual revolution and the welfare state.

We shouldn’t allow that sort of scapegoating. Still, that’s not the only relevant danger. Virtue cloaks can be perilous in their own way. They give cover to real and serious misdeeds, particularly in professions (like policing) where people already have a strong, natural tendency to circle the wagons and protect their own. When alarming police shootings occur, that should prompt us to ask: Are these rare aberrations? Or have we, by reflexively defending law enforcement at every turn, helped create conditions in which corruption and brutality can proliferate unchecked?

The Perils of Virtue-Cloaking

We’ve seen this pattern before in other professions. Ask the Catholic Church what happens when an intense concern with public image induces leadership to ignore a growing avalanche of red flags. Pope John Paul II (now a canonized saint) was in most respects an inspiring leader and an intensely holy man. Nevertheless, his strong commitment to developing and ennobling the priesthood gave him something of a blind spot when it came to bad priests. When rumors trickled upwards that priests were abusing minors, the pontiff seems to have assumed that this just couldn’t be true.

Some have suggested that the Soviets once used allegations of sexual misconduct to undermine and discredit good priests. The young Karol Wojtyla (who would later become Pope John Paul II) got used to dismissing such charges as so much anti-clerical hot wind. It’s easy to understand how that could happen. Plenty of modern people hate the Church! But in this case, tragically, it wasn’t hot wind. When the horrific realities of priestly sexual predation came to light, the Church suffered a blow from which it has yet to fully recover.

Obviously, the tragedy was devastating for the victims of abuse, and their families. The Church’s reputation was also badly tarnished. The fallout still affects rank-and-file Catholics by the millions, as punishing lawsuits push dioceses into bankruptcy. Unsurprisingly, the crisis deepened an already-dire vocations crisis, and good priests suffered immensely through 2000’s. Just ask a cleric how it felt in 2002, when parents would see him in the frozen food aisle and shepherd their kids in the opposite direction.

Last January, on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, Ted Cruz described the police as modern-day Levites, our priests clad in blue. Perhaps some people liked that image. I shivered.

The Warning Signs Are There

Even those who favor quasi-sacerdotal policemen should be more cautious. To the attentive and unbiased eye, the red flags are already there, indicating that many American police departments need more transparency, and better oversight.

Let’s start here. Why are there so many fatal police shootings in the United States? The gap between our nation and our European counterparts is eye-popping. Since 1990, Great Britain has had a total of 60 deadly police shootings. The city of Chicago beat that number in just five years. Meanwhile, across the US there were more than a thousand fatal police shootings in 2015, and we’re on track to match that number again this year.

These are very big numbers. Different societies are different of course, and there are lots of ways to explain statistical disparities, but can we first allow ourselves the obvious and natural reaction? Wow.

It isn’t always easy to get definitive information on police shootings. Unless someone was standing on hand with a cell phone, we may not have the kind of evidence could definitively tell us whether a shooting was justified or not.

Consider this, though. The statistical differences between police departments are sometimes quite big, even when we control for obvious things like crime rates. Despite its crime-susceptible population and its liberal-narrative-obsessed mayor, New York City has an admirably low number of police-related deaths. The same cannot be said of Kern County, California, which led the Big Apple last year in fatal shootings even though it has an average homicide rate and a tenth the population.

When historically high-crime cities see above-average numbers of police shootings, that’s unsurprising. When high numbers of shootings correspond in noteworthy ways to a lack of transparency, enthusiasm for the death penalty, or longstanding habitual support for tough-0n-crime policies, that should generate more concern.

Here’s another interesting fact: Police departments across the nation are paying out a fortune in lawsuits. This trend started before Black Lives Matter, and has led to the largest 10 police departments paying out more than a billion dollars in settlements since 2010. Is this just another symptom of our cop-hating, litigious culture? Perhaps, but a rise in legal hush money might also be a sign that police misconduct is more widespread than most conservatives want to believe.

The Right Way To Defend Cops

We owe it to the public, but also to good cops, to concern ourselves with these details. Honest cops don’t deserve to be tainted by the misdeeds of others. They inevitably will be, though, if an avalanche of ugly incidents persuade the public that the police are out to kill them.

Let’s suppose, sometime over the next few years, that Black Lives Matter and its supporters unearth a host of incidents like the ones seen this week. Suppose we find ourselves flooded with damning footage, skillfully buried police reports, and quietly settled lawsuits involving violent and undisciplined cops. Have conservatives positioned ourselves to defend good cops in such a circumstance? We’ve been telling people for a long time that “police brutality” is mostly a trumped-up canard of social justice warriors. If that turns out to be substantially untrue, how much credibility will mainstream conservative pundits have left?

Before we lose our cool over irresponsible political rhetoric, we should consider for a moment how much worse things could get. It’s true that many liberals would like to blame the police for a host of social ills. Most of their beloved social programs have had some awful social consequences, so it soothes them to think that policing might be the real problem. Many liberals would surely love to seize the advantage and start pinning all our social problems on the cops. At the moment, though, the public seems reasonably skeptical; the police remain of our most trusted institutions, and those numbers have remained relatively stable over the past twenty years. That could change, however.

It’s worth noting at this juncture that some libertarian outlets have been far more assiduous about considering evidence of problematic police aggression. Radley Balko, the Cato Institute, and Reason Magazine have all given coverage to policing issues; from another angle, The American Conservative has published some very circumspect pieces on justice issues. Still, most mainline conservative publications remain devoted to building up the “priests in blue”.

Police Reform Can Help Everyone

We should by all means defend cops against unjust accusations and tendentious political statements. We should be zealous about publicly exonerating individuals who are unfairly maligned by politically-interested parties. Ferguson’s Officer Darren Wilson is the obvious example, and he deserves whatever amends can now be made to him after the firestorm of criticism that sent him and his family into hiding, following what now definitely seems to have been a reasonable and justified shooting.

Still, before we accustom ourselves to tendentious phrases like “Ferguson effect”, we should make a concerted effort to understand the situation. Most importantly, we should always be looking for ways to make things better. Don’t we want to halt the evident deterioration of relations between citizens and the police in many of America’s higher-crime neighborhoods. It’s bad for all concerned when residents and cops feel like mutual enemies. Our interest in addressing that problem should outweigh our anxiousness to insist that liberals and their constituents bear the full blame.

Mac Donald is right to remind us that good cops deserve our respect. It’s also undoubtedly true that policing will attract more good men if it is held in high esteem. In the long run, though, we won’t be able to achieve that through head-in-sand denials of real problems. Law enforcement will only command the public’s respect by earning it, and by responding appropriately to genuine misconduct.

There are a number of ways that we might improve policing while still supporting the police. I recommend this article for an overview of some of the “low-hanging fruit”, which includes higher transparency and an improved awareness of mental illness. We need to think seriously about what forms of oversight are most effective. We should work on curbing the power of police unions, which predictably resist transparency.

It all begins, though, with good-faith engagement. Cops are not blue-clad priests, and a badge isn’t a license to kill. For everyone’s sake, conservatives need to work on new strategies for protecting American citizens from the people who should protect them.

Dallas Police Chief: Gunman 'Wanted To Kill White People',"In Dallas, five people were killed and seven others were injured Thursday night during what’s being called the deadliest day for police officers in the U.S. since 9/11.

While they were keeping order at a protest against police brutality, four Dallas police officers and one Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) officer were killed Thursday night by at least one gunman who was shooting from an elevated position. The DART officer has been identified as Brent Thompson, who was 43 years old. The identities of the four other officers have yet to be revealed.

Dallas Police Chief David Brown said the suspect who was killed during the standoff with police said he was upset about Black Lives Matter and wanted to kill white police officers.

BREAKING: Dallas chief says suspect wanted to “kill white people, especially white officers” https://t.co/uRRqtay4XT pic.twitter.com/L38Lt7FvUU



MSNBC (@MSNBC) July 8, 2016

“The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Brown said during a press conference on Friday. “He was upset about the recent shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect said he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.”

Authorities have identified one gunman, who is now dead, as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, of Dallas. Johnson was a U.S. citizen and an Army veteran. He had no known ties to any terror groups, nor did he have a criminal history.

During the standoff with police, Johnson reportedly told authorities that “the end is coming,” and that there were explosive devices throughout the area surrounding the protests.

One suspect was killed by an explosive device attached to a robot which was deployed by law enforcement.

Three other suspects remain in custody.

In a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, President Obama said the nation is “horrified” by these events.

Thursday night’s protest was in response to two black men who were shot and killed by police officers within 48 hours of one another earlier this week. In response to these shootings, protests have taken place across the country.

5 Takeaways From the Dallas Police Chief’s Press Conference,"Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas Police Chief David Brown held a press conference Friday morning in the wake of a sniper shooting during a Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Dallas that killed at least five officers and injured seven more and two civilians.

Here are five takeaways from the press conference.

1. Police Killed a Suspect with a Robot Carrying a Bomb

Brown said Dallas Police deployed a robot carrying a bomb in the parking garage where a suspect had been involved in negotiations with police for hours. Officers detonated the bomb near the suspect after hours of talks had broken down, killing him. They “saw no other option,” he said.

""Saw no other option."" Dallas Police Chief David Brown confirms police used a bomb robot where the suspect was. pic.twitter.com/Fwzcxi2Gqj — Fox News (@FoxNews) July 8, 2016

That was not the only bomb at issue in the chaos, as rumors flew on social media about the suspect/s having placed bombs throughout the city. None of those rumors have been borne out but Brown said, “the suspect stated that we will eventually find the IEDs.”

“Our hostage negotiator did an exceptional job getting this suspect to talk before he died,” Brown said.

2. Gunman Said he Wanted to ‘Kill White People, White Officers’

Initial reporting suggested there were at least two shooters, and three others were taken into custody— two men and one woman— but Brown said the dead suspect may be the only one. Mayor Mike Rawlings said “We’re not going to tell you anything about the suspects and we’re not going to answer questions,” but Brown revealed the suspect’s declarations of his motive toward the end of the press conference.

“You can’t crawl into the head (of someone who would do this). We negotiated with this person. They seemed lucid during. He wanted to kill officers. He expressed killing white people. He expressed killing white officers. He expressed anger for Black Lives Matter…None of that makes sense.”

3. Brown and Rawlings Were Unclear About Number of Suspect/s and their Descriptions

Brown suggested that the dead suspect was the only shooter, but also said, “We’re not satisfied that we’ve exhausted every lead.” He said they were being sparing with details to help the search for possible collaborators.

“If there’s someone out there who is associated with this, we will find you, we will prosecute you, and we will bring you to justice…We’re not expanding on who or how many. We’re going to keep these suspects guessing.”

4. Brown said Police Don’t Feel Support Most Days, but Need It Now

“Some closing thoughts about Dallas Police officers and DART officers. They’re some of the bravest men and women you ever wanna be associated with. You see video footage after video footage of them running toward gunfire from an elevated position with no chance to protect themselves, and put themselves in harm’s way to make sure citizens can get to a place of security.”

“Please join me in applauding these brave men and women who do this job under great scrutiny and under great vulnerability who literally risk their lives to protect democracy. We don’t feel much support most days. Let’s not make today most days. Please. We need your support to be able to protect you from men like these who carried out this tragic, tragic event.”

5. Brown and Rawlings Asked for Prayer

In the wake of recent shootings, there has been pushback from the political left against “thoughts and prayers,” which activists claim are hollow and insincere compared to gun control policies in the wake of such attacks. Dallas’ leaders, however, declared themselves “men of faith” and asked for prayer to get the city through this time. There is an interfaith prayer gathering planned for noon today in Dallas’ Thanksgiving Square.

“Pray for these families…they are not having a good time trying to deal, absorb this, trying to understand why, and they need your prayers. Please join us in helping us comfort the grieving officers’ families…please pray for our strength through this trying time,” Brown said.

“If you’re at our home or your office or your school to join us today at noon in prayer, to bring our city together to bring our country together, to heal wounds, not create them,” Rawlings said.

Don’t See Tragedy In Black Neighborhoods? You’re Not Looking,"I will never forget the day I got it. A bright day in my majority-black neighborhood in Southeast DC, police swarming the street as they finally busted the woman who had sold drugs out of the bus stop for months. My neighbor and I standing on our porches watching the aftermath. The police were milling about, mopping up, done with the action and starting the paperwork.

My neighbor, a black man, was better educated than I and worked a professional job probably making more money than me. He and his wife filled their home with music and art, kept their yard meticulously orderly, traveled the world.

As an aside, this may sound like a “very articulate” statement, an expression of surprise that such a black man existed, or singling him out as unusual, but he wasn’t. Perhaps he was a little on what I believe is called the booshy side, but there was nothing unusual about him. Most people in our neighborhood were like most people across America: Hardworking citizens living their lives, raising their families, tending their business in peace.

I describe my neighbor as a real person I knew. I cannot imagine he ever had trouble with the law, at least not of his making, and I am certain he had no warrants or probation to worry about. Yet as I stood to watch the police in action, he said, “I’m not going anywhere near that mess,” and fled into his house.

It was the look in his eyes. It was primal and afraid. He knew deep in his bones that he needed to keep away from police. It was instinct, something deeper than rationality.

It puzzled me because I, a white woman, knew deep in my bones that the police were there to help me. If I ever got lost, hurt, or afraid, I merely needed to call them and they would rescue me. I remembered once, as a girl, coming home to my suburban neighborhood only to find birds had broken into the house and were roosting on my grandmother’s silver. Naturally, after I failed to shoo them out, I called the police. Naturally, they came and flushed the birds out the window. It seems so silly now.

It Was Hard to Feel the Police Cared

But things were different in my majority-black neighborhood. I had never called 911 in my life, but I had cause to in that neighborhood. Me, on the phone in the wee hours of the night, more scared than I have ever been, pleading with them to hurry as screams came from my front yard. A man siccing three pit bulls on another man, standing, watching, approving as they bit and clawed. Yes, they were both black, victim and perpetrator.

Me, hiding irrationally behind the bed even though the men couldn’t see me, terrified the dog would tear the man’s throat out before the police came. No sirens in the distance. Just an eventual roll-by, arriving after the attacker had taken his dogs home, a single officer who did not get out of his car. He handed the bleeding victim a paper towel and called an ambulance. No charges were ever filed.

It was hard to feel the police cared. But then again, why would they? The victim would never testify against the thug who harmed him, probably did not even tell the officers who it was. A code of silence protected such people. I saw other things, too: Juries refusing to convict men who had been caught dead to rights selling drugs, juries putting thugs back on the street to victimize the community. The complicated and byzantine relationship between the community and the law, and the police are on the front lines. Hostility and need, disappointment and great heroism.

I saw women who had perhaps once had lovers or husbands but who were now alone, raising children, pouring themselves into the neighborhood with incredible dignity and strength. Men who preach, serve, and fight to bring peace to their neighborhoods. The incredible everyday heroism of this most American of stories, I began to see.

That heroin addict was not a heroin addict. He was Kevin, who had wrestled in high school, had had talent and gotten an athletic scholarship, who had hoped to compete in the Olympics, his eventual death of overdose a blow to the family who loved him. The beggar by the metro was not just a beggar but Mr. Jackson, a would-be musician consumed by alcohol. Shattered dreams do not hurt any less if you have a hand in shattering them.

I Don’t Blame You, But There Has to Be a Better Way

One Halloween, I was surprised to meet a teenager living across the street. I did not know he lived there—his single mother working two jobs made him stay inside for fear of what would happen to him on the streets. He might be attacked by thugs, seduced by thuggery, attacked by police, killed by a senseless act of violence, so he stayed inside always. He was a burly young man with a genial face, the type of young man a violent teen would attack just to prove himself. I remember thinking simultaneously that I didn’t blame her and that there had to be a better way.

I saw that the young men, and a few young women, who died each week were not just thugs gone wrong but Carla’s grandson or Sammy’s cousin or the kid of someone Yvonne went to high school with. I saw the young men, about one a year, who were killed because they dared to do well in school, dream to be better, and, even more insulting, lumped in with the violent by people who didn’t bother to distinguish one black victim from another.

So I began to understand, just a little, that the black community lives in a constantly unfolding nightmare. They can see it coming from far off in so many lives like a wave, and are powerless to stop it. They see a little boy, a precious child of theirs, grow into something lost. Someone’s baby, someone’s grandbaby. And they think “not another one.” They see a little girl with hope in her eyes fall to violence, and they say “not another one.” They see a man, a good man, gunned down by police, and think “not another one.” This chorus goes through their minds: “not another one.”

White America lives in another world where they never think that, never feel that in their bones. Yet it is something to be felt deep in the bones, something to breathe in and out. If we see a two-line obituary about a teenager killed by gang violence and do not see the tragedy of it, that is on us. If we see prisons bursting with broken dreams and do not see the tragedy, that is on us. If we see a man who dies for no good reason—even if the police are justified in wrongly thinking he was a threat—and do not see it for the tragedy it is, that is on us.

This is a problem for all Americans. I do not think white Americans are guilty, as more militant people believe, of wanting black people dead or repressed. I also believe the answer lies in conservative principles and rule of law as opposed to socialism. But I do think white Americans are guilty of willful blindness, of thinking a problem has been solved when it hasn’t, of living in a bubble and not seeing the struggle of their fellow Americans.

We lack compassion, we lack empathy, we do not see our brothers and sisters in their distress. The police are not the problem. We all are. And the solution will only come the American way: citizens working together toward a common goal of peace and prosperity.

Are We Living 1968 All Over Again?,"The social disorder accompanying the 2016 election cycle has led to comparisons with the socio-political turmoil of 1968. Some in the media, including James Fallows and Alec MacGillis, have been quick to remind us that the body count at home and abroad was much larger in 1968. Jonathan Chait holds up President Obama’s government-by-stakeholders as a rejoinder, as though all the worst moments of 1968 represented the whole of that year.

Indeed, more than a year ago, Noah C. Rothman argued the problem of urban violence is far more nuanced now, with implications for both major political parties. Nevertheless, we casually dismiss the comparisons of 2016 to 1968 at our peril.

Thankfully, 2016 has not seen political assassinations like those of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. or Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. The riots following MLK’s death resulted in dozens of deaths; the occasionally violent protests following officer-involved shootings in this cycle generally have not. Ill-trained and sometimes racist police shooting citizens under sometimes questionable circumstances does not approach the horrors of Jim Crow.

Yet we feel today’s deaths no less than past ones. The breakdown in trust between our more integrated police forces and the disproportionately minority communities they police remains a cause for serious concern. Conversely, as I write this, a gunman who fired on police in Dallas during a protest stated he wanted to kill white police officers out of anger at police-involved shootings. That the gunman does not appear to have been part of the Black Lives Matter protest does not make the police officers any less dead. Our reactions to these tragedies are magnified by the Internet bringing them live to our smartphones, much as the perception of Vietnam was affected by graphic, daily television coverage unknown in prior wars.

Even absent assassinations, we suffer from a vacuum of political leadership perhaps unseen since 1968. The parallels between Donald J. Trump’s candidacy and George Wallace’s 1968 run, from the stoking of race-tinged grievances to the well-attended populist rallies, have been widely discussed. Hillary Rodham Clinton’s pathological lying, conspiratorial bent, self-pity, and self-entitled disregard for the law recall Richard Nixon as much as they mirror some of Trump’s worst qualities. The possibility of violent protests at both major-party conventions has been seriously entertained. That libertarian Gary Johnson may be the closest comparison to Hubert H. Humphrey in 2016 arguably suggests a worse menu than Americans faced in 1968.

Obama’s Echoes of Johnson

This year’s political vacuum has different causes. In 1968, Lyndon Baines Johnson chose not to seek a second term rather than face the voters’ judgment on Vietnam, race-related unrest, and the like. President Obama is far more popular, and will not face the voters again by law.

Yet Obama remains a Johnsonian figure. He entered office aspiring to be as transformational a figure domestically as LBJ (or Ronald Reagan, as he would put it). He vastly expanded the federal government, whether through the (still-unpopular) Affordable Care Act or an array of executive and administrative actions of varying degrees of legality. The latter category includes everything from his attempt to make immigration policy without Congress (now enjoined) to his coercion of an Illinois school district into granting a transgender student access to the girls’ locker room (now in litigation).

President Obama’s response to urban disorder has been largely the same as that in 1968: gun control. Crime statistics and elections since 1968 should have deterred Obama and his Democrats from this obsession, but they have not. To the contrary, congressional Democrats traded on the legacy of the civil rights movement by staging a sit-in to advance a gun control blacklist that would infringe on the right to keep and bear arms without due process of law, disproportionately punishing Muslims. That this Orwellian stunt was led in part by Rep. John Lewis reflects worse on 2016 than on 1968.

President Obama also has been dogged by inherited foreign entanglements to which he lacked commitment, much as Johnson was. He has been forced to extend our commitment in Afghanistan (his “good” war), where the Taliban is as strong as it has been since 9/11. His precipitous withdrawal from Iraq fulfilled a campaign promise, but created opportunity for the virulent Islamic State and a conflict that (as with Vietnam) spilled over national borders and caused humanitarian tragedies.

The resulting refugee crisis has contributed to: the destabilization of governments across Europe; the United Kingdom voting to withdraw from the European Union; and terror attacks in Europe and the United States (including dozens of fatalities in Orlando, for those fixated on body counts). Like Johnson, Obama has misunderstood his enemies, tried to wage war on restrictive terms, and reaped the whirlwind. One can almost smell the bouquet of vintage 1968 malaise.

Are the 1970s Ahead Again, Too?

These failures of leadership, now as then, are not limited to the White House or national politics. State and local governments bear primary responsibility for other failures of governance, symbolized by the failures of urban policing. These issues are less racial than they were in the Dixiecrat South, or in the Chicagos or Bostons of 1968, but they are not entirely race-neutral, either.

Similarly, our institutions of higher education are again roiled by political strife. The primary differences are that the causes celebre for college protest now are generally less weighty (and occasionally hoaxes), while the responses from targeted administrators are generally more feckless (perhaps out of nostalgia for 1968). Other parallels are observed in pop culture. In 1968, some of our Olympians saluted the Black Panthers; at this year’s Super Bowl, Beyoncé Knowles and her dancers…saluted the Black Panthers.

In 2016, the New Left’s aggressive agenda of revolutionary social change has been met by the New Reactionary Right’s appeals to the worst angels of our nature. The pressures extremists have brought to bear against a disconnected and weakened political elite resemble those of 1968. We recognize the symptoms of these social ills, even when the symptoms are less severe.

We also recognize that our immediate choices seem inadequate to address these ills. Dismissing these comparisons only increases the risk that our future looks more like the 1970s, for which 1968 was a socially costly launch pad.

Dallas Police Chief To Young Black Men: We’re Hiring,"In a press conference Monday, Dallas Police Chief David Brown told young black men to improve their communities by joining law enforcement in their hometowns.

“Become a part of that solution,” Brown said. “Serve your communities. Don’t be a part of the problem. We’re hiring. We’re hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in. We’ll put you in your neighborhood and we will help you resolve some of the problems you’re protesting about.”

Brown’s remarks come on the heels of last week’s massacre in Dallas. During a Black Lives Matter protest last Thursday night, a shooter killed five police officers and wounded seven others — making it the deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11.

Over the weekend, more than 100 were arrested at BLM protests held nationwide. In Oakland, protestors blocked a major highway for several hours in response to police fatally shooting two black men earlier last week.

Brown opened up about how he first got involved with law enforcement and why joining the police force is a more gratifying way to initiate change than just protesting.

So when I was graduating high school, I got a full-ride scholarship to UT Austin. And this was 1979. Come back home for the summer. Around ‘80, ‘81, ‘82, around that time frame, the crack cocaine epidemic hit Dallas pretty hard.



My friends who stayed here became involved in that. It broke my heart. And it changed what I wanted to do in college. And I actually left college my first semester of my senior year to come back and apply to the Dallas police department. Do something about what I was seeing in my neighborhood.



My first beat was my old neighborhood. . . I get so much satisfaction that I can do a small thing to help this community. I just love Dallas. I love serving. It’s part of my character. It’s part of who I am. Out of all the crap we have to take as police officers, the satisfaction you get with serving is much more gratifying. . .It’s like that for a lot of police officers in this country.

"If You Don’t Want Cops To Shoot You, Don’t Resist Arrest","It saddens me that what little is left of the black civil rights movement is spent defending thugs, hustlers, drug dealers, and troublemakers such as Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile. Can you believe we’ve gone from honorable causes like fighting for the right of black people to attend college to defending black criminals who foolishly mouth off against, run away from, and fight with the police; police who are putting their lives on the line to protect us from criminals?

Can’t the protestors at least defend young black men of honor, quiet heroes going against the grain by wearing their pants around their waist; refusing thuggery, weed-smoking, and hustling; those who marry one woman, have all their kids with that one woman, proactively raise those kids to be successful, productive citizens, and love only their wife and no other woman; those who work an honest job with integrity, intensity, and discipline, no matter how menial the work? (Note: selling illegal cigarettes on the street or bootleg CDs on the corner doesn’t count as honest work!)

If a protest were held against the oppression of such young black men, I’d be the first to join in. Yet every time I hear of a black man being killed by the cops, he’s not the man I just described. He’s almost always a criminal thug I have no desire to defend. Hardly our best, and hardly what Dr. King died for.

It’s Easier to Blame Everyone But Yourself

You see, unlike those men recently shot, I do not fear for my life from the police. Quite the contrary, my life is made safer by the police who stand between me and people like Sterling, who is much more likely to break into my car or stick me up at night compared to any harm that might come to me from a police officer. The fact is, the police are not shooting black men like me. Why? Because I am not a criminal, and when the police stop me, I politely do what they say, and they leave me alone. I do not run away, fight back, or mouth off. It’s really pretty simple.

Why is no one asking how these men’s families and communities failed them so badly that they became criminals or thugs? If you look up “tough” in the dictionary, my grandmother’s picture will come up. If you were raised under her and acted up, after she got done with you you’d wish the police had gotten to you first. I’m glad my father was raised in such an environment. Discipline happens in the home, and it starts early. When it doesn’t, the police are left to clean up the mess of deeply broken human beings who were already doomed before their first interaction with the law. It’s totally unfair to ask the police to treat hardened criminals with kid gloves.

How did we get here? The Welfare Industrial Complex has produced generational government dependence that has devastated black families and communities and created the criminal underclass of black thugs the police are killing today. I wonder what Black Lives Matter has to say about that? Will they unequivocally call for an end to the welfare, food stamps, and government subsidized housing that have replaced the black father, and thus return the role of family provider to the black man where it belongs, not the government?

Will they call for a complete end to illegal immigration and to burdensome regulations and taxes that make hiring Americans too expensive? After all, these things reduce wages, increase unemployment, and harm the ability of young black men to get jobs that provide for a family. My guess: don’t hold your breath. It’s just so much easier to blame the police, white privilege, and institutionalized racism.

Yet amid all the hype, let us not lose sight of reality: No matter how much the media attempts to stir up racial strife, the fact is about 70 black people are killed by other black folks for every one killed by a white police officer. White police killings of black people are simply a non-issue compared to what black people do to each other, unfortunately.

So no, despite the prevailing atmosphere of hysteria, I’m not afraid of being killed by the police. Quite the contrary: sadly, the data shows I’m much more likely to be victimized by a fellow black man than by a white police officer. So may the police remain sharp, aggressive, and strike fear into criminals so the good people don’t become victims.

This Week We Are All Black Lives Matter,"In the early 1960s the nascent platform of television news brought images of the civil rights movement into the living rooms of American white people. Most understood the reality of racial discrimination, but had never seen firehoses and dogs set on human beings. The images shocked and galvanized them. It led to change—often not enough change, sometimes the wrong change, but the truth could no longer be ignored.

This week, the videos of the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile have shocked a white America that has known for too long there is a problem. Every white American paying attention already knew police kill black men at alarming rates. But knowing isn’t seeing. This week we saw and felt the shock and pain of a woman losing the man she loves. This week the technologies of smartphones and social media brought all this into our living rooms.

As if these horrible events were not enough, in their wake five police officers are dead in Dallas, victims of a madman who set out to kill white cops. It’s a reminder that our rhetoric has consequences, but so does our silence.

After watching these videos I understood the term “Black Lives Matter” in a new way. In fairness, the movement (which I remain critical of in significant ways), has been trying to explain it to me for some time. What the term really means is that black lives don’t matter. Not enough, anyway. This is an ugly concept for white Americans to accept. But it is a daily reality for America’s blacks.

Hear Our Cries, Someone

So far, this carnage has failed to convince much of white America that there is a crisis going on. Individual events can be painted as isolated incidents. Statistics can be used to show that black men have a higher rate of police interactions. We can tell ourselves, truthfully, that police departments and the government are initiating training and best practices. After all, what can we really do other than sit in our living rooms and watch?

Ever since the riots in 1968 black protesters have been mocked for burning down their own neighborhoods. But there is a logic behind this that is important to understand. We watch. If the protesters in the Newark riots had gone to raise hell on the Upper East Side, white America’s response would have been a lot more than watching. It would have led to a confrontation the protesters knew they were bound to lose.

But white America watched the Watts riots, just as we watched Ferguson. In both cases black Americans were yelling “Look at me!” They were demanding that we see and feel the crisis of police violence towards blacks. Not as an esoteric problem, but as a time bomb, ready to go off at any minute with the news of another deadly police shooting.

When the next black man or child is killed, we will once again wince, shake our heads, and hope officials get their act together. Then we will return to our lives, the things that really matter. This is the problem Black Lives Matter is attempting to address. Do I agree with them shutting down others’ speech to put their message first? In most cases I do not. Do I understand why they are doing it? Absolutely.

If instead of black people being murdered by police we were facing the outbreak of a disease, or a drumbeat of killings by foreign actors, it would be the only story until the problem was solved. It would not ebb and flow into our consciousness with each breaking newsflash. As wrongheaded as some of the movement’s actions have been, on this point they are quite correct. We aren’t acting like this matters to us.

Silence Is Not the Answer

It is difficult for white Americans to know what they can, or even what they are supposed to, do. On the one hand we are told to be allies, standing in the background, silently listening to voices of the voiceless. But at the same time we are told this is our problem and only we can fix it, which is doubtless true. But these two admonitions are at cross-purposes. White people cannot face this problem with an attitude of respectful silence.

We must be loud about this crisis. It must stay above the fold, and in our feeds. We must be animated and angry. More than anything, we must let our black countrymen know we see this for what it is and we will not stand for it. Do not be swayed by the white race-baiters posting pictures of victims to make them look like criminals. There will be cases where the victim is a sinner; there will be cases where the victim is a saint. But what these cases must represent to us is one single broad problem: police killing black people.

The 1960s were a time of tremendous and important legislative and judicial change. But ultimately, it wasn’t the laws or the state that underwent the most important change. It was us. We were shocked into self-reflection. We were stunned into caring. Attitudes changed. Ultimately, we must trust and promote that hope of changing attitudes.

Law and policy can attempt to address systemic racism, but every system is eventually implemented by people. The hand that holds the gun is the only system. In those long, deadly moments choices are made, threats assessed, and actions taken. We must never accept the color of a person’s skin influencing the police officer facing these situations.

I’m not convinced white Americans have accepted this. In fact, I know many have not. As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, “No, they don’t.”

Now is the moment we must not avert our eyes. We must stare at this scourge of killings and demand that stopping them take the highest priority. If we believe, as most of us hope we do, that all lives matter, now is the time to prove it.

Black Lives Matter’s Violence Undermines Its Credibility,"In the aftermath of police killings of two black men—Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota—Black Lives Matter (BLM)-led protests have sprung up in cities all over the country. While their grievances are clear and compelling, their methods of achieving redress are questionable and may hurt the movement’s long-term goals.

BLM may intend to do the right thing: enlighten the public about injustices within the black community, especially at the hands of law enforcement.

#BlackLivesMatter advocates dignity, justice and freedom. Not murder.



— Black Lives Matter (@Blklivesmatter) July 8, 2016



After the news of Castile and Sterling’s deaths hit the nation, BLM held a protest in Dallas, Texas. Although that protest started out peacefully, it ended in bloodshed when a gunman who had a vendetta against white cops murdered five and injured several other on-duty officers.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick blamed BLM: “I do blame people on social media, with their hatred toward police. I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests ― last night was peaceful, but others have not been… this has to stop.”

The events in Dallas have set off a firestorm of protests, demonstrating just how livid and unruly the movement has become. Instead of protesting peacefully nationwide and despite condemning the Dallas shooting, BLM is doubling down in its protests, often violently. They shut down an interstate and major thoroughfare in Miami. In Oakland, protestors vandalized a police station with red paint and spray-painted streets, also stopping traffic on an interstate, during which protesters climbed atop a stalled semitrailer. Others lit a bonfire on the freeway.

Even widely viewed photos such as this one hide this aspect of violence, as the woman looks peaceful yet is being removed from a roadway she refused to exit of her own volition in an attempt to keep disrupting traffic.

Violence in Saint Paul

Police pulled Castile and his girlfriend over because he matched the description of an armed robbery suspect (at first media reported it was only for a minor traffic violation). It’s also reported he had a license to carry a firearm. It now appears as though those two pieces of information combined to aggravate an under-trained or trigger-happy officer, as the cop shot Castile four times and he died following the incident. Castile’s girlfriend shot this video live to Facebook, which went viral, fueling BLM to organize an impromptu protest on the streets of the Twin Cities Saturday night.

BLM shut down part of Interstate 94, a major highway in St. Paul, and although it appears to have begun peacefully, some people started throwing water bottles, pieces of concrete, rebar, brick, Molotov cocktails, and rocks at police. At 3:27 in this video you can see a person throwing a small firecracker towards the police. To break up the crowd and push them off the highway, police responded with flash/bang grenades. About 100 protesters were arrested and more than 20 cops were hurt, one with a spinal fracture.

Few people are likely to be sympathetic to Black Lives Matter when they protest police by throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at them, spurring multiple arrests, then demand to be released.

Snarling At Police Has Got to Be Effective, Right?

Following Sterling’s death on Saturday, caught on video here, BLM protested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he lived. BLM activist DeRay McKesson tweeted, just before he was arrested, that police were provoking them “for no reason.” But when you watch the clip, the police are walking alongside or escorting the protestors, and the protestors are the ones making snarky insults.

And now the police are pacing the protestors, provoking us for no reason. #BatonRouge https://t.co/bCGmh46x7T

When “a few hundred people” attempted to close off a Louisiana interstate, police headed them off and arrested between 30 and 40.

Good Cause, Bad Approach

BLM may wish to be peaceful, well-meaning, strategic, and persuasive, and these violent and disruptive behaviors are the actions of a relative few. Yet when the “few” are attacking police officers, it’s hard to overlook. As Barbara Reynolds, a minister and 1960s activist, wrote last year of the current movement:

Many in my crowd admire the cause and courage of these young activists but fundamentally disagree with their approach. Trained in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr., we were nonviolent activists who won hearts by conveying respectability and changed laws by delivering a message of love and unity. BLM seems intent on rejecting our proven methods…[A]t protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot. The demonstrations are peppered with hate speech, profanity, and guys with sagging pants that show their underwear. Even if the BLM activists aren’t the ones participating in the boorish language and dress, neither are they condemning it.

The BLM movement, unlike King’s, only seem to come out in droves following very specific murders: when white cops kill black people. Yet this is not the major scourge of the black community. Recounting his days as mayor of New York City, when crime was reduced by over 50 percent, Rudy Giuliani noted on Fox News,

Black Lives Matter hasn’t saved nearly as many black lives, if they’ve saved any at all, as I have. Where are they? Where are ‘Black Lives Matter’ when six kids get shot in Chicago by other black kids? The reality is we’re going to end this issue when we get control of the significant amount of violence in urban America within the black community. And it’s the police who are doing that. Black Lives Matter divides us.

Given the videos of the killings of Castile and Sterling last week, it seems clear BLM has legitimate grievances. But if they want to be heard and remembered as a movement that changed racial unrest in America, in line with the success of the 1960s civil rights movement, they must do so without provoking police or inciting violence. Until they can figure out how to do this, their actions will continue to besmirch their reputation and cause.

We Can Reduce Police Violence By Asking Police To Do Less,"President Obama and former President George W. Bush are attending a big rally in Dallas today to call for healing and reconciliation in the wake of deadly police shootings last week in Louisiana and Minnesota, as well as the sniper attack that left five Dallas police officers dead and more than a half-dozen wounded—an act of revenge, according to the shooter, for police violence against black Americans.

It’s understandable and appropriate for our political leaders to call for calm. We need cool heads to prevail right now. Even while vigils for the slain officers were underway in Dallas, massive protests went forward over the weekend in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Saint Paul, Minnesota, where thousands marched against police violence and hundreds were arrested.

But we need to do more than talk about race and call for reconciliation. We need to have a conversation about the relationship between the police and the public, and ask ourselves whether we really need armed agents of the state interacting with citizens as much and as often as they do. More to the point, we need to ask ourselves whether it’s right and desirable to use the police to enforce the innumerable regulations of an overweening administrative state.

Enforcing Petty Laws Can Be Violent

Consider some of the high-profile police killings that started with routine police enforcement of some petty local ordinance. Eric Garner, the black man who died in 2014 after NYPD officers put him in a choke hold, was breaking the law—he was selling single cigarettes, “loosies,” outside a convenience store. Did that crime warrant a visit from the police?

In the case of Philando Castile, the man police shot and killed in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, last week, the encounter was apparently a routine traffic stop prompted by a broken tail light. Who among us hasn’t been pulled over for that? It’s true that Castile was armed, but had a valid permit to carry a concealed handgun. When he told the officer he had a gun and then reached for his wallet, the officer shot Castile multiple times.

Walter Scott, the South Carolina man killed last year by a police officer who shot him in the back as he fled, was initially pulled over for a broken tail light. Scott was stopped in the parking lot of an auto parts store. According to his brother, he was headed there to get the tail light fixed.

The Police Can Arrest You For Almost Any Infraction

In many states, almost any minor infraction of the law is an arrestable offense. Even in a politically conservative state like Texas, where elected officials routinely mock liberal, overregulated states like California and New York, small crimes and traffic violations not punishable by jail time can still get you arrested. That’s in part thanks to a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, which held that arresting someone for not wearing a seatbelt isn’t a violation of their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.

Keep in mind that arresting someone is inherently violent. Much of law enforcement is, and of course that means police officers themselves are often in danger, which in turn might explain why some of them seem so jumpy and, at times, too quick to draw their guns and shoot.

The case of Alton Sterling, the man killed by police last week in Baton Rouge, demonstrates how quickly an arrest can become violent, and how quickly the rights of bystanders can be violated. Sterling was killed by police officers after an encounter outside a convenience store where he was selling CDs—illegally, it turns out, but with the store owner’s permission.

Police were responding to a 911 call warning that an armed black man was threatening someone outside the store. That call, it turns out, was likely made by a homeless man who’d been harassing Sterling, and Sterling showed him his gun to make the man go away. Video of the ensuing incident with police clearly shows Sterling didn’t have the weapon in his hand when one of the officers yelled “gun!” and fired six shots into his chest. The store owner claims that after police shot Sterling they confiscated surveillance video, his cell phone, and locked him in a police car for hours despite his protests that they get a warrant.

What Do We Really Want The Police To Do?

Given all that, shouldn’t we think carefully about what laws we want to dispatch the police to enforce, and which ones aren’t worth the risk of potentially deadly violence? That of course brings us to mass incarceration and the war on drugs. Drug-related offences vastly outnumber any other category among those incarcerated in federal prisons, accounting for nearly half of all offenses. The share of drug offenders is less in state prisons (16 percent in 2012), but still significant.

Of course, the problem of mass incarceration goes beyond the drug war. More than 10 percent of those in state prisons are there for “public-order” offenses like liquor law violations and “commercialized vice, morals, and decency offenses.” Maybe most Americans agree we should lock people up for things like prostitution or weapons violations. But would they agree that jailing people is the best way to deal with someone who fails to appear in court for a traffic ticket, or stumbles out of a bar drunk when it closes? Probably not.

By all means, let’s talk about improving race relations, let’s mourn those who have been killed, and work harder at unifying the country and bringing people together. But let’s not stop there. Let’s think about what we want the police to do, and why, and ask ourselves whether we really want to have the kind of country where the long arm of the law is constantly reaching out and tapping us on the shoulder.

Is Anti-Race-Baiting A Form Of Race-Baiting?,"Heather Mac Donald has spent a good portion of her career assuring people white cops aren’t racist. In 2010 she wrote a book entitled “Are Cops Racist?” Here’s the quick summary: No.

Mac Donald’s most recent book explores similar themes, and she’s written multiple articles in the same vein, including this one, penned last February but reprinted this past weekend by the Wall Street Journal. A fresh missive reiterating the same themes appeared in the Journal on Tuesday.

I agree with Mac Donald: Very few cops (of any race) are bigots. Here’s my concern, though. I’m not sure this is an answer to the questions many Americans are asking right now.

Mac Donald clearly wants this to be the question. Her article in the Journal begins with four quotes from the major Democratic presidential contenders, all related to criminal justice. Hillary Clinton is quoted as saying “too many encounters with law enforcement end tragically,” and “we have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.” Bernie Sanders is on record promising “no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will,” and “It is not acceptable to see unarmed people being shot by police officers.”

Now we get Mac Donald’s summary: “Apparently the Black Lives Matter movement has convinced Democrats and progressives that there is an epidemic of racist white police officers killing young black men.” Wait. Which of those quotes mentioned racist white police officers?

Bad Outcomes Don’t Necessarily Imply Evil Intent

Go back and read them again. Both candidates lament racism, and both decry a “broken system.” Neither one says anything about bigoted cops.

Perhaps you think this is hairsplitting, and that it’s perfectly obvious what Sanders and Clinton both meant. You should reconsider. The Democratic candidates are saying two distinct things. First, our criminal justice system has some problems that particularly (“systemically”) disadvantage blacks. Second, we’re seeing far too many tragic incidents in which police shoot or kill citizens.

It’s entirely possible for these assessments to be accurate for reasons that have little or nothing to do with police bigotry. Actually, there are many reasons these things could be true, which would in no way reflect personal prejudice among law enforcement.

Police officers enforce laws other people make. They deliver offenders to courts they don’t control to receive punishments others decide. They’re regularly subject to bureaucratic pressures to make this or that an enforcement priority, and their resources are perpetually limited. In short, there are innumerable reasons the system could be “broken” that would have nothing to do with racist cops.

Undoubtedly, some radical members or associates of Black Lives Matter do levy egregiously unfair charges against (especially) white cops. Last week that resentment spilled over into horrific bloodshed, which is why the WSJ decided it was an appropriate time to reprint Mac Donald’s piece.

Was that a healthy response, though? It might be if there were a chance cop-hating black radicals would read Mac Donald’s piece and be convinced. Realistically though, I don’t think the Wall Street Journal has much influence in that crowd. Its readers are conservatives, who should at this moment be looking for common ground and viable solutions, not radioactive buttons to push. Unless and until particular Democrats personally decry an “epidemic” of racist white cops, we shouldn’t saddle them with such inflammatory views. We also shouldn’t interpret their words in ways that are maximally injurious to the honor of white cops.

Are Cops Trigger-Happy, Or Are Black People Violent?

Lethal police shootings are controversial for a reason. It’s hard to blame “the system” when an officer shoots a suspect; presumably the blame lies with the officer, or the suspect (or possibly some combination of the two). But if we are indeed witnessing “an epidemic” of lethal police shootings, that surely says something about the police as a group, or about the people being policed.

Obviously, Mac Donald’s money is on the latter. Her argument, though, is decidedly odd. Drawing on the Washington Post’s meticulously kept data on police shootings in 2015 (The Guardian has engaged in a similar project), she points out that “fatal police shootings make up a much larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths than black homicide deaths.”

Come again? It’s strange how Mac Donald skips right past the obvious questions and focuses on a very specific detail of the Post’s broad-ranging project. Shouldn’t we maybe start by considering whether we have a worrisomely high number of lethal police shootings in general, and whether (and by what ratios) young black males are disproportionately victims?

There is also some recent evidence blacks are disproportionately likely to be stopped and harassed by police but not disproportionately likely to be shot in a police encounter. (Interestingly, Mac Donald does reference this study in Tuesday’s article, but only the portion relating to shootings. She doesn’t mention the disproportionate use of non-deadly force.)

Given all these interesting details, it’s odd how quickly she races to a rather specific question: If a particular person is the victim of a homicide, how likely is it that a police officer pulled the trigger? We can anticipate the answer. Given the fact of having been killed by another person, whites and Hispanics are more likely to have been shot by the police.

The stress Mac Donald places on this one weird statistic should itself make us wary. It’s clear she doesn’t want to discuss the alarmingly high number of police shootings. She wants to talk about the violence of dysfunctional black subcultures. After discussing her ratio-of-homicide-victims stat for two whole paragraphs, she bolsters her point by observing blacks also represent a disproportionate number of police assailants, and are disproportionately charged with robbery, murder, and assault. At last, she puts a bow on her “blacks are violent” argument by citing evidence black officers are more trigger-happy than their white counterparts.

We get the point. Don’t blame the white guys. They’re just trying to do their jobs.

Asking the Right Questions

This would be a solid argument if our main interest were in holding a moral magnifying glass to the hearts of white police officers. Mac Donald can build a strong case that police departments are not a breeding ground for white bigots. In fairness, that point holds some legitimate interest in light of the wild allegations flying through the virtual world and threatening the peace of several American cities.

Do black citizens have non-fanciful reasons to mistrust or resent law enforcement?

Having said that, it might still be worthwhile to broaden our range of questions. I humbly suggest most people are less interested in the racial attitudes of cops than in questions like the following:

Are our laws, and the means by which we enforce them, burdensome to honest and (at least mostly) law-abiding black citizens, especially those who live in poorer neighborhoods?

Are law-abiding black citizens more likely to be harassed, detained, or shot by police than law-abiding non-black citizens? Are petty (black) lawbreakers more likely to provoke a disproportionately forceful response from law enforcement?

More generally, do black citizens have non-fanciful reasons to mistrust or resent law enforcement?

Mac Donald’s statistics give us reason to think white cops probably aren’t, in general, racist. But that could easily be compatible with a world in which law-abiding black citizens (especially in high-crime neighborhoods) very reasonably view the police as a threat.

Some Helpful Hypotheticals

There is actually an upside to civic unrest over police shootings: it’s precipitated a push for better data and increased study of policing patterns. Hopefully, this will enable us to generate new strategies for training and deploying police effectively. In the meanwhile, some hypotheticals might help to illustrate why Mac Donald’s data, although not wholly irrelevant, really doesn’t answer the crucial questions.

You’re far more likely to be the victim of such an error if you live in a high-crime, low-trust neighborhood with a lax attitude towards due process.

Let’s suppose that certain predominantly black neighborhoods, for a range of historical reasons, have high crime rates and a pervasive mistrust of law enforcement. Solving major crimes in such neighborhoods is challenging. There are lots of murders, but a dearth of willing witnesses or informants. Still, the residents aren’t the type whose personal problems get reported on CNN, so standards for due process start to slip. That in turn poses dangers to the law-abiding, undermining further the relationship between local residents and police.

In such a scenario, proportionate numbers (of police shootings to crime stats) wouldn’t necessarily tell the whole story. Even honest, non-bigoted police are going to get the wrong man occasionally. You’re far more likely to be the victim of such an error if you live in a high-crime, low-trust neighborhood with a lax attitude towards due process. Roland Fryer’s much-celebrated recent study, although admirable in the scope of its data, wouldn’t necessarily reflect those sorts of problems.

We could add another wrinkle by supposing some cities might (historically or in the present day) have viewed the safety of impoverished, predominantly black neighborhoods as a relatively low priority. A rash of break-ins in the mansion district provokes panic, a press conference, and the threat of new management if the police don’t address the problem. By contrast, stacks of unclosed homicides from poor black neighborhoods just don’t make the mayor’s agenda.

In such a world, we might see homicides raging largely unchecked in certain neighborhoods, driving up black homicide rates. The associations might then lead blacks in gentrified neighborhoods to be viewed (somewhat reasonably) with greater suspicion. Meanwhile, the overall black homicide rate could still seem to justify the disparities, while in reality, honest black citizens might be right to suppose they’re at greater risk. More importantly, black citizens in such a world would have some reason to think society at large was lamentably indifferent to their well-being.

We should note that hypotheticals like the above could all be broadly true even if America had not a single racist cop.

Pointing Fingers Versus Seeking Solutions

The most discouraging thing about Mac Donald’s coverage of this topic is the dearth of suggested solutions. Both Journal articles imply public outrage should be directed towards black crime and not police misconduct. This is also a curious argument. Of course black homicide is a terrible thing. Still, social movements normally aim their messages at those who are interested in public opinion. That doesn’t include murderers. If widespread social disapproval were sufficient to deter violent crime, it’s fair to say our homicide rate would be close to zero.

We shouldn’t try to bury the realities of social breakdown, but we also shouldn’t use them as a de facto excuse to do nothing.

We shouldn’t try to bury the realities of social breakdown, but we also shouldn’t use them as a de facto excuse to do nothing. It’s important to support good cops, but one way to do that is by seeking real solutions. Both cops and residents suffer when relations between neighborhood residents and law enforcement break down.

What sorts of measures might help to alleviate the problem? Better transparency? Improved training procedures and attention to mental health? Changes in the way we allocate our resources? As a longtime expert in policing, Mac Donald could be addressing these questions instead of focusing relentlessly on answering a question that relatively few are asking.

Most cops aren’t racist. It doesn’t follow, however, that black citizens have no real grievances.

National Conversations About Race Distract From The Issues,"In the wake of recent tragedies in Baton Rouge, Minneapolis, and Dallas, the online chatter has been a mixed bag. Everything from Second Amendment protections for blacks to police officers’ heroic protection of protestors has been discussed.

The Black Lives Matter response was: “This is a tragedy–both for those who have been impacted by yesterday’s attack and for our democracy….Black activists have raised the call for an end to violence, not an escalation of it.” Leon Wolf’s Red State article suggested “The most important safety valve to prevent violence like we saw in Dallas last night is the belief that when officers do go off the rails, the legal system will punish them accordingly.”

When read carefully and taken in context, both responses offer important points. Along with other reactions, they help clarify one larger point: we waste too much time on anecdotal conversations about race—especially after tragedies that have racial elements to them.

Race Is Too Easy to Politicize

We argue over things like whether the perception of menace creeps into the minds of white officers who approach young black men. We argue over whether police treat whites differently than they do blacks, insisting upon or rejecting outright race-equivalency. We contemplate whether there is reverse racism among black officers.

Then we argue about the dangerous nature of the job police officers do every day, and whether they should be given leeway because of it. When that doesn’t satisfy (and it never does), many turn to symbolism. Will the president call for healing? Will presidential candidates urge racial unity? In others words, too often Americans work themselves into a frenzy over abstract issues like bias and racism, for which there are no silver bullets.

Many discussions about race and policing have a lot to do with winning hearts and minds to a particular view. In practice, they tend to be an appeal to one group to accept the beliefs and assumptions held by another. This becomes a punitive process. Competing groups browbeat the other into accepting their grand narratives about American life, past and present.

Why do blacks and whites have to agree about race or policing issues? Why do we have to agree to disagree? I don’t think we’ve ever been very good at this approach, and it leads us away from more foundational conversations about what it means to live in a free society.

Let’s Instead Focus on Keeping Government Accountable

Americans understand that in a free society the main role of the government is to protect its citizens. This should happen through law and order, limited regulation, protection of property, etc. The best way to maintain our liberty state by state and community by community is fraught, as it always has been in our democracy. But insisting on checks and balances tends to favor the will of the people.

With the nation at a fever pitch over policing and politics, now is the time to clamor for more checks and balances at every governmental turn to shore up our free society. The way to do this is to keep in mind something as basic as quality of service in our public institutions.

Pundits and lay people are contending with social science research these days. An article in The Washington Post by Wesley Lowery pores over several statistics from the Post’s database concerning the number of blacks and whites fatally shot by police. Lowery cautions that “comparing how many or how often white people are killed by police to how many or how often black people are killed by the police is statistically dubious unless you first adjust for population.” Ultimately, the Post reports the same number of unarmed killed for blacks and whites.

I’m citing this data because it’s provocative and could easily be sensationalized. Isn’t that essentially how it works with other public institutions—be it the National Security Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or the local county commission? Serious questions are raised, people lift their voices, and the torrential demand for accountability unfolds. I have no problem with keeping public officials on their toes. In America, expressing displeasure with public institutions through the proper channels is never a bad thing.

In contrast to race talk, one of the things we’re good at most of the time is experiencing indignation when we interact with public institutions. We do this in virtually every government sector—not out of spite, but because people care about quality of service. Policing is no exception. In an era of seemingly unrestrained government, it’s crucial that we remain a nation that is critical of its public institutions, and that embraces transparency and accountability.

Let’s Get Practical, Not Abstract

Even as we mourn across the country, questions about how local governments can serve citizens better must be raised. For example, if black neighborhoods are on balance more violent than others, then how are tax dollars being used to address this problem? Our institutions have to become more creative, and if they can’t because of bureaucratic inertia, then those dollars need to be diverted elsewhere.

It’s unfair that police shoulder the burden of so many social ills when they encounter criminal elements in a community. Unfortunately, a number of the people they engage are unruly and hostile, while other encounters are amicable and uncomplicated. Either way, in a free society, police, like other public officials are due respect, not obeisance. It should also come as no surprise that there has never been a level playing field between police and offenders. Police bear a much greater burden and are held to a higher standard. Citizens have the right to expect that standard of professionalism.

As we process the tragic loss of life, communities across the nation—particularly those affected by high-profile incidents involving police—are working to improve police-community relations. Police are resolved to serve their communities, and citizens are installing review boards and councils to counterbalance questionable law enforcement practices.

It’s worth celebrating that people across America are growing more concerned about concentrated power at all levels of government. This makes our republic more resilient. Of course for many this is an agonizingly slow process, but what we see in cities like Ferguson and Baltimore today is a hopeful mixture of support and critique. If we’re honest about American history, gradual progress like this has been the rule and not the exception.

I Don’t Hate Black Lives If I Don't Rush Judgment On Violence,"Temporarily suspending judgment on the recent police shootings of black men Philando Castile and Alton Sterling does not mean I don’t think black lives matter.

David Marcus wrote recently here at The Federalist that white people don’t really think black lives matter—at least, not as much as they should. The article is called “This Week, We Are All Black Lives Matter,” but he really means that only black people are Black Lives Matter (BLM). This is false and needlessly divisive.

Marcus sees the gunning down of black people by police as an epidemic white people acknowledge, but they’ve been so far unconvinced “there is a crisis going on.” He writes, “What the term [Black Lives Matter] really means is that black lives don’t matter. Not enough, anyway. This is an ugly concept for white Americans to accept. But it is a daily reality for America’s blacks.”

Marcus brushes off crime statistics baked into the arguments of BLM skeptics. These includee statistics such as: blacks are charged with the majority of robberies, murders, and assaults in the 75 largest counties, meaning cops may encounter a higher proportion of blacks than whites in potentially lethal situations. As a percentage of total homicides, 12 percent of white and Hispanic deaths are due to police, while only 4 percent of black homicides are due to police. Ignoring those who point things like this out, Marcus instead issues an indictment of white America: “As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, ‘No, they don’t.’”

It’s Simply Wise to Wait Until the Facts Are In

According to Marcus, white America has been silent, and “respectful silence” is apparently unacceptable, even as a hyperactive media spins out of control with toxic levels of conjecture and too few concrete facts. Many of us were silent for a time after Michael Brown was shot and killed, even as the pits of our stomach filled with horror reading the initial tweets covering the tragedy. We were ultimately glad we had restrained ourselves and did not let visceral rage crowd out any room to accept new information or lines of reasoning.

It was painful to see a mother lose her son, and to see young life cut down in violence. But what did we learn? We learned that “hands up, don’t shoot” was a lie. We learned Brown wasn’t shot in the back while running away. We learned that Officer Darren Wilson had good reason to fear for his life and was, according to a grand jury, justified in shooting Brown.

The videos of Sterling and Castile’s recent deaths are jarring and horrifying, but even cameras don’t tell the whole story. Consider this video, for instance, documenting a traffic stop from the moment the officers approach the vehicle to the final violent conclusion. It took three body camera angles watched multiple times and played in slow motion for me to even glimpse the driver’s gun, and even then I was shocked. Who would have thought this seemingly calm individual who obeyed every order from the officer would turn violent?

Facts Steer Us Towards Addressing the Real Problems

Empathy for the suffering is critical, and feelings matter. Humans are meant to relate to one another emotionally, and to deny the fear, heartache, and horror many black people are experiencing based on these events is wrong. To deny cops’s fears they may be gunned down for their profession or viciously smeared for a lethal confrontation between races is wrong also. Feelings matter, but so do facts. Always.

Without facts, we cannot move toward real solutions. Without facts, we let our passions launch us ever deeper into our own personal realities, into deep, narrow pockets of spite, prejudice, and ignorance from which we cannot view any inconvenient truths, nor even the different experienced realities of others. Having isolated ourselves into our respective “sides,” we cease to empathize, listen, and cooperate toward common goals.

Facts alone cannot change the course of events. Marcus is right that passion is a critical component for any social reform. But facts, valid information, are the basis for meaningful dialogue that leads to effective and positive change. Without them, partisanship and prejudice spin us further into chaos.

Some of us are waiting for more information, and for any initial misinformation to dissipate. Hopefully we are not waiting for the “right” information—that is, information that fits conveniently into our worldview, at which point we launch into our pre-meditated opinions. But we are not in error to wait for the fog to clear before launching into a full-throated argument for this side or that. While many white Americans may be reticent to opine on very recent police shootings, or may not be as “angry and animated” as Marcus would want, our silence by no means indicates a complacency that rises to the level of “black lives don’t matter.”

Police Brutality Is Not the Black Community’s Only Problem

In fact, many whites have been begging America to address the disproportionately high number of black-on-black homicides, gang violence, high school dropout rates, levels of poverty, and family breakdown for a long time. Black lives do matter, independent of the color of uniform or skin of the people who end them. Rebecca Cusey’s recent article discussing her experience living in a majority-black neighborhood casts a bright light on the tragedies afflicting the black community, tragedies we absolutely must be concerned about.

Maybe BLM is right to assert police brutality doesn’t rank high enough on our list of priorities for aiding the black community, but the point is that our care for black lives expands beyond BLM’s narrow scope to cover these other struggles, many of which contribute to the black community’s high homicide rate.

May God rightly judge us for any complacency in unjustified violent deaths, but surely we should not be judged by others for temporarily reserving our judgement on new, highly controversial incidents, either.

Texas Governor: Attacking Police Should Be A ‘Hate Crime’,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to make it a hate crime to attack police.

On Monday, Abbott called on the Texas legislature to pass a law he called the “Police Protection Act,” which would make any crime committed against a police officer a hate crime. That distinction would increase the penalties imposed against anyone convicted of attacking police.

“Under current law, assault with bodily injury is generally punishable as a Class A misdemeanor, while assault on a public servant, including a law enforcement officer, is a 3rd degree felony,” a press release from Abbott’s office stated. “Under Governor Abbott’s proposal, in cases where the assault is on a law enforcement officer, the penalty would increase to a 2nd degree felony.”

The proposal comes on the heels of the anti-police massacre in Dallas where five officers were gunned down and killed by a single gunman, making it the deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11. On Sunday, three police officers in Baton Rouge were gunned down by a man who was intending to kill law enforcement officials.

“At a time when law enforcement officers increasingly come under assault simply because of the job they hold, Texas must send a resolute message that the State will stand by the men and women who serve and protect our communities,” Abbott said in a statement.

Lawmakers will likely vote on the proposal during the next legislative session. You can read more about the proposed legislation here.

Black Lives Matter Doesn’t Believe Its Own Slogan,"Like so many, I’ve watched with a heavy heart the malicious violence that is sprouting like poison ivy across the country, germinated by liberal applications of incendiary rhetoric and misplaced indulgence. In the city in which I was raised, Baton Rouge, three police officers were assassinated and three officers were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. One of the dead, a black officer with 10 years on the force, had recently posted on Facebook about the angst and mounting pressure he felt from the very community he ultimately gave his life defending. Does his black life matter? Where are the protestors on his behalf?

Yet the list of horribles continues. On the same day officers were killed in Baton Rouge, officers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were dispatched on a domestic disturbance call where a 20 year-old with two felonies on his record opened fire on the police car, wounding an officer inside the vehicle. Eight officers have been killed nationwide in 11 days. Here in Memphis a week ago, protestors took to the streets with their signs and chants and didn’t stop until they had shut down Interstate 40 in downtown Memphis.

For more than five hours, truckers, travelers, parents, and children sat, helplessly stranded on the I-40 bridge over the Mississippi River. (And you think the kiddos can be a challenge when the car is moving!) In one case, paramedics struggled to extract a sick child from the stranded traffic and transport the child to the hospital. How many others who needed medical attention remained stranded is unknown to us and to the resolutely impervious crowd that held commuters hostage.

Naturally, I was interested to see what my colleagues at The Federalist would have to say about events, and went right away to David Marcus’ very moving essay, “This Week We Are All Black Lives Matter.” While the overall appeal to greater understanding and empathy was laudable, somewhere along the way David was carried aloft on the headwind of his good intentions, and deposited somewhere between sentimentality and mawkishness.

The Disproportionality Runs the Other Way

Highlighting the fatal confrontations of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile with the authorities, David writes, “Every white American paying attention already knew that police kill black men at alarming rates.” That’s a pretty sweeping statement on behalf of a lot of people David has never met, and it needs some further scrutiny.

In 2015, according to information collected by the Washington Post, 26 percent of the people killed by police officers were black. Now, if that is alarming, what then are we to make of the fact that a full 50 percent of people who died at the hands of police officers were white? Should the fact that whites were killed by the police at nearly double the rate of blacks take us from alarm to outright panic? Should we shout that white lives matter and wreak havoc, or should we take a deep breath and dig a little deeper into the facts?

Heather Mac Donald, author of “The War On Cops,” has done a stunning and thorough amount of research which has yielded, among other things, the fact that blacks make up just 15 percent of the population in the nation’s 75 largest counties (2009), yet comprise 45 percent of all assault defendants, 62 percent of all robbery defendants, and 57 percent of all murder defendants. In New York City alone, where blacks comprise 23 percent of the population, they account for 75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime.

The wonder therefore, isn’t that a group so highly represented in violent crime comprises 26 percent of deaths that occur in altercations with authority, but rather that the rate isn’t higher still. Whites, who account for 33 percent of New York City’s population, commit less than 2 percent of all shootings, 4 percent of robberies and 5 percent of all violent crime while having the highest fatality rate in confrontations with police. Happily, they haven’t resorted to blocking interstate highways and targeting the police and show no interest in doing so.

It’s Not Necessarily Racism to Pursue Black Suspects

“As black Americans shout, yell, and cry that their lives matter, the eerie silence of white Americans carefully balancing causes and solutions whispers back, ‘No, they don’t,’” David Marcus writes. To divide a group of people by race and assume that they think monolithically is not only erroneous on its face, it’s the sort of presumptuous tribal division we usually associate with the hard left. To further presume to reach into the minds of these people en masse and hear them whisper that black lives don’t matter is insulting.

“The hand that holds the gun is the only system,” David continues. “In those long, deadly moments choices are made, threats assessed, and actions taken. We must never accept the color of a person’s skin influencing the police officer facing these situations.” Well, given the facts presented above, which I assume he must have been unaware of, the burden of proving that skin color is influencing the police falls to David. But he will need to come to terms with the following as well, which Mac Donald presented recently at Hillsdale College:

These disparities mean that every time the police in New York are called out on a gun run — meaning that someone has just been shot — they are being summoned to minority neighborhoods looking for minority suspects. Officers hope against hope that they will receive descriptions of white shooting suspects, but it almost never happens. This incidence of crime means that innocent black men have a much higher chance of being stopped by the police because they match the description of the suspect [emphasis mine]. This is not something the police choose. It is a reality forced on them by the facts of crime.

Add to this the fact that the number of cops who’ve been killed in shootings has more than doubled in only the first three months of 2016, and the fact that a police officer’s chances of being killed by a black person is 18.5 times higher than the odds an unarmed black will be killed by a police officer, and the risks associated with an officer responding to violent crimes in the places where they usually occur come into sharper focus. To lump these and other relevant factors under the blunt title of someone’s skin color “influencing the police officer” betrays a rather incurious simplicity regarding a complex topic.

A protestor who admitted he was taunting Dallas police later told how some officers rushed him and pushed him away from the gunfire when the shooting started. He told of seeing one of those officers fall to the ground, shot while saving the protestor’s life. Decisions that save lives, like those that take them, are not made in “long, deadly moments,” as David dramatically contends, but rather in the heat of the moment and in a fraction of a second.

Police Aren’t the Major Problem for Black People

To the extent that the deaths of blacks has become an issue of race, it has been made so by race hustlers from Barack Obama on down to the usual suspects who rather conveniently fail to address the fact that blacks nationwide commit homicide at eight times the combined rate of whites and Hispanics, and that black males aged 14-17 commit homicide at ten times the combined rate of white and Hispanic male teens.

The question then becomes: Black lives matter to whom, exactly? Because the numbers show it isn’t police officers who are hunting down innocent African Americans. Rather, the awful fact is that the last face a black homicide victim is likely to see is the black face of his killer. Closing the nation’s highways, looting business in the black community, and disrupting the lives of law-abiding citizens will not change that reality even a little bit.

When Memphis’ interim police director met with Black Lives Matter protestors on the I-40 bridge Sunday evening, they all agreed to a cease-fire in the city’s ongoing homicides, which have reached more than 120 people in 2016. No more killings, they said, for the next 30 days. Less than 24 hours later, predictably, another homicide took place.

So we are entitled to ask: Do black lives matter to the thugs who prey on the innocent in their community, who steal from them and assault them? Do black lives matter to a culture that demeans and dehumanizes women in its music and its actions? Exactly how precious are black lives in Memphis, where I live, where young black males regularly swerve on their motorcycles and in their cars across busy interstate highways at speeds in excess of 100 mph, wantonly endangering and sometimes taking the lives of motorists of all races?

Stop Blaming Poverty

In his 1984 book, “Civil Rights, Rhetoric or Reality?” Dr. Thomas Sowell, himself a product of Harlem, wrote:

Few people today are aware that the ghettos in many cities were far safer places two generations ago than they are today. Incredulity often greets stories by older blacks as to their habit of sleeping out on fire escapes or on rooftops or in public parks on hot summer nights. …In the 1930s whites went regularly to Harlem at night, stayed until the wee hours of the morning, and then stood on the streets to hail cabs to take them home. Today, not only would very few whites dare to do this, very few cabs would dare to be cruising ghetto streets in the wee hours of the morning.

So what happened? Dr. Sowell continued:

…If crime is a product of poverty and discrimination as they say endlessly, why was there so much less of it when poverty and discrimination were much worse than today? If massive programs are the only hope to reduce violence in the ghetto, why was there so much less violence long before anyone ever thought of these programs? Perhaps more to the point, have the philosophies and policies so much supported by black leaders contributed to the decline of the community and personal standards, and in family responsibility, so painfully visible today? For many, it may be easier to ignore past achievements than to face their implications for current issues.

Hillary Clinton says she wants to have a conversation about race. Fine. Let’s start with Sowell’s observations and explore whether such programs as Mrs. Clinton and President Obama have long advanced have helped or hurt the black community. Let’s explore whether a system that has encouraged generational dependence on government have yielded the results that were promised when its central programs were enacted more than 50 years ago.

By all means, let’s explore the liberal commitment to the lives of black children, for whom the most dangerous place in the world is in their mother’s womb. As Alveda King, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s niece, noted in 2014:

Right now in America almost half of our babies are being killed in the womb, and in certain parts of America more of our babies are being aborted than being born. While we were marching in the sixties, a place was being prepared for us at Planned Parenthood. We were trying to get off the back of the bus, and they were going to have a space for us in the front of the abortion mill.

Where are the protestors lamenting the hundreds of thousands of black lives claimed by the abortionist each year? Where are those who would confront Mrs. Clinton about her admiration for eugenicist Margaret Sanger, who referred to blacks as “human weeds?”

Yes, there is much to talk about, but we do not advance the conversation by ceding ground to the progressive mythology of racist cops or the progressive habit of dividing people by race for the purposes of assigning collective guilt or deification. Rebuking an entire race for imputed racism is a horribly misguided and repugnant exercise, whether it comes from the Left or the well-intentioned among us.

We are Americans, and we are individuals first and foremost, and we do not advance our country, our communities, or our neighborhoods by suspending the standards of civil society and civilized conduct, or by excusing lawlessness and anarchy—period.

Black Lives Matter Leader: ‘Defund Police’,"A year ago, two police officers in New York were executed while they sat in their patrol car. A week ago, five cops were killed in Dallas. Now three more officers have been murdered in Baton Rouge by a man inspired to kill because he believed the news about police unfairly targeting black men.

If you are to believe to President Obama, who issued a statement right after the shooting, these events should not be linked to anyone or any movement: “These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no one. They right no wrongs. They advance no causes.”

One needs wonder if President Obama’s eagerness to explicitly reject the connection between any movement (including Black Lives Matter) and the string of murdered police officers is a result of the sort of criticism recently lodged against him by writers like Myron Magnet at City Journal. Magnet, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, recently penned an opinion piece entitled “America’s Worst President? I nominate Obama, the Anti-Lincoln.”

Magnet’s main point is that Obama has stoked the flames of resentment against police officers throughout his presidency by repeatedly—either explicitly or implicitly—suggesting white police officers’ shootings of non-white people are acts of racism. Meanwhile, Obama largely ignored the scourge of black-on-black crime, delivering only a single speech on the topic.

What’s Wrong With Leaving Police High and Dry

Maybe Obama should have listened to his former chief of staff turned Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel, who late last year blamed the uptick in violent crime in Chicago on police officers “going fetal” and second-guessing their actions because of the national scrutiny on the way they do their job.

Ironically, it appears Obama’s silence on black-on-black crime coupled with intense scrutiny on police officers—either using the bully pulpit of his office or using the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division—has made our country decidedly less safe for the very people of color he professes to want to help. Like so many campaigns of the progressive left (such as welfare, overtime mandates, and minimum wage increases) the Black Lives Matter movement makes life worse for the people it is designed to benefit.

Still, despite the empirical evidence that BLM is adversely affecting the very communities it is designed to help, many people still think there is merit to the protest movement. After all, there are pretty obvious cases of overzealous white police officers shooting and killing black people in an unjustified manner. In some of these cases, it also appears there is racism involved. Shouldn’t there be a protest movement for these cases? Take the case of the white police officer in South Carolina who was filmed shooting a black suspect in the back as he fled.

As the son of a retired police officer who was shot in the line of duty—while trying to apprehend a suspect who had already killed another police officer—let me be the first to say I agree with those who think civic engagement in communities should hold police officers accountable for their work. We should do this in the same way we might hold any of our public officials accountable for what they do for us.

Defunding a Crucial Part of Government Isn’t Accountability

This, though, brings us to the crux of why BLM is rotten at its core: It is not like any other movement to keep our public servants accountable. The goal of the BLM movement is to systematically undermine our nation’s law enforcement officers and make their job both less safe and less effective. Just listen to a recent interview of three founders of the movement on NPR.

In typical NPR fashion, Ari Shapiro fawns over the BLM founders, asking them, “Given all of the momentum that your movement has right now, given all the attention being paid to Black Lives Matter, on this the third anniversary, what is one tangible thing that you would like to see this inertia lead to?”

The immediate answer from BLM founder Patrisse Cullors: “Defunding police departments.” How can BLM say the movement is pro-police if its stated goal is to eliminate the very funding that makes it possible for police to safely fight crime in our streets?

It is a common refrain of the Left that government programs are ineffective because stingy fiscal conservatives don’t put enough resources into them: just ask any Democrat why education, social service programs, and government health care don’t achieve the promised results. The answer is always that we just haven’t funded them adequately. Why should police departments be any different?

After the sort of police shooting we just witnessed in Baton Rouge, activists will no doubt flood social media and cable news with a defense of BLM like the one recently made by “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah: “If you’re pro-Black Lives Matter, you’re assumed to be anti-police,” he says in the sort of haughty didactic tone that has made “The Daily Show” so popular amongst leftists. “And if you’re pro-police, then you surely hate black people. It seems that it’s either pro-cop and anti-black or pro-black and anti-cop, when in reality you can be pro-cop and pro-black.”

No, Mr. Noah, you can’t be both pro-cop and pro-black if you’re part of the BLM movement. BLM is explicitly anti-cop and, if you think anything else, you’re just not listening to them.

"Targeting Police Isn’t A Hate Crime, It’s Terrorism","In the wake of recent deadly shootings, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has asked his state legislature to consider making violence targeted at police a hate crime. While increasing penalties against those who kill or injure cops can help protect the men and women who protect us, new hate crime laws are a poor way to achieve that goal. Specifically targeting law enforcement is not a hate crime; it is an act of terrorism.

Conservatives might well enjoy the rhetorical irony of using a hate crime label to describe and punish actions against the police. After all, the legal notion of hate crimes, which became popular in the late twentieth century, has generally been a tool of the civil rights movement. Just as many opponents of Black Lives Matter have appropriated that term and turned it into Blue Lives Matter, Abbott’s legislation seems to put the hate crime shoe on the other foot.

This may be part of growing trend among conservatives to reject programs that carve out special benefits or protections for Americans based on perceived oppression of a race or group identity. But in this case, adopting the use of “hate crime” is misguided—not because attacks on police cannot be motivated by hatred—they certainly can be—but because the very idea of a hate crime is a dubious proposition to begin with.

Criminalizing Hate Criminalizes Thought

Hate crime legislation became popular in the late 1970s as a way to enhance punishment for violent crimes committed with bias against a protected group. Such laws effectively state that punching people because they are gay or black, for example, should be more greatly punished than punching someone because you don’t like them individually. In most cases the hate crime is added to the underlying crime in prosecution.

The problem with the concept of hate crimes is that it very specifically allows the state to criminalize thought. It is not illegal to harbor hatred or animosity towards groups of people. It is irrational and stupid, but not illegal. Nor should it be. Asking judges and juries to punish people on the basis of their bigotry quite literally turns the government into the thought police.

One could argue that intent, a valid consideration in prosecuting crimes, also equals thought policing. But the traditional use of intent differs from the use of hate crime statutes in significant ways. Typically, intent is used to determine the extent to which an individual knowingly committed a crime and understood the gravity of its consequences. This is an old idea in law. In 1789, in his “An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,” Jeremy Bentham addressed the issue:

Let us observe the connexion there is between intentionality and consciousness. When the act itself is intentional, and with respect to the existence of all the circumstances advised, as also with respect to the materiality of those circumstances, in relation to a given consequence, and there is no mis-supposal with regard to any preventive circumstance, that consequence must also be intentional: in other words; advisedness, with respect to the circumstances, if clear from the mis-supposal of any preventive circumstance, extends the intentionality from the act to the consequences. Those consequences may be either directly intentional, or only obliquely so: but at any rate they cannot but be intentional.

Bentham argues intention must be split in two. First, was the act intentional? Second, was the consequence of the act intentional? Motive plays a role in determining whether a criminal act was intentional, but not regarding the intent itself. Whether a criminal act of violence is committed out of jealousy, anger, fear, or hatred, the bottom line is still the physical intent. The proper role of government in most cases is to punish the act, not the motivation.

Once we go down the path of punishing motivation itself, we invite a legislative parade of horribles. In New York City it is now illegal to maliciously refer to a transsexual individual by a pronoun he or she does not prefer. This speech is not criminal because of the act of itself, it is criminal because the speaker is denying the moral orthodoxy of transexuality.

We should naturally expect the concept of a hate crime will lead to establishing hate speech as a criminal act. In most cases, one’s speech is used to prove the group bias that constitutes a hate crime. Someone who harbors animosity towards blacks and punches a black person is less likely to be charged with a hate crime than someone who uses a slur before throwing the punch. It is even possible that a perpetrator who uses a slur may not harbor bias, but may simply be attempting to insult his victim.

For all of these reasons is it ill-advised for Abbott and the Texas legislature to make crimes against police hate crimes. As satisfying as it may be to use progressive dogma in the furtherance of protecting police, it reinforces limitations on thought and speech that are very un-conservative.

Instead, Label Anti-Police Violence Terrorism

If we want to increase penalties on those who specifically target police in acts of violence—and we should—there is a better way to do it. Instead of considering such acts hate crimes, we should consider them acts of terrorism. By doing so we can punish the act, not the motivation, and potentially give law enforcement enhanced methods of preventing such acts.

Setting out to kill random police officers, as we recently saw in Dallas, Baton Rouge, and New York City, is an act of political violence. It is an attack on the rule of law and the systems of government. It is an attempt to undermine public confidence in police and to promote general fear. Importantly, undermining state authority is not merely the killer’s motivation, but also inherent to his act.

Some criminal acts specifically targeted at groups based on race, religion, or sexual orientation may also contain terroristic elements that can be used to enhance penalties. It would be best for us to replace the idea of hatred or bigotry with that of terrorism in policing and prosecuting such actions.

But for now, Abbot and the Texas legislature should resist the urge to use liberal thought policing to protect our cops. Not only is unlikely to be effective, it also codifies a legal argument that conservatives should reject. Even in our very justified anger and horror at police killings, we must proceed in measured ways, just as police should and do proceed in measured ways when they protect us.

5 Things President Obama Needs To Say About Black Crime,"President Obama held a nationally televised town hall last week to address heightened tensions and divisions in our society due to recent shootings of black criminals by police, and the recent shootings of police officers in Dallas. Just days after the event, three police officers in Baton Rouge were assassinated, further highlighting the high stakes for how the president handles this issue.

I was invited to attend last week’s town hall and ask the president a question, but ultimately could not make it. But I did watch it at home, and would like to highlight some key points President Obama did not to make, which could have begun the process of healing and reconciliation.

Indeed, Sunday’s execution of three police officers in Baton Rouge shows what can happen when the president creates an atmosphere of racial victimization and blames police. So it is critical that Obama develops a new message that takes us in the right direction before things get worse and there’s another incident.

With that in mind, here are the statements President Obama should have included in his remarks last week.

1. ‘We Must, Must, Must Reduce the Black Crime Rate’

The black crime rate is significantly higher than that of other races. Yes, some would claim this is due to institutionalized racism or a lack of job opportunities. However, black crime was much lower in past eras when discrimination against black people was much higher, and the economic position of black people was much worse, than today. So that can be no excuse.

President Obama should have talked about how the overall crime rate for black people is three times higher than the national average. He should have noted how blacks commit homicide at a rate eight times higher than whites do, according to Department of Justice data. Even though blacks and Hispanics combined make up only 30 percent of the population, they make up more than 80 percent of all gang members in the United States. He should also have talked how even though black folks are only 13 percent of the population, we commit about 62 percent of all robberies and 56 percent of all carjackings. Obama should have then asked: “Is this really what Dr. King died for?”

2. ‘We Must Put the Black Family Back Together’

Even though the studies clearly show that children born into single-parent homes have worse outcomes in nearly every area, sadly, today about 72 percent of black kids are born to unwed mothers. This has created a whole new generation of troubled young men who have an increased likelihood of entering a life of crime and getting themselves into altercations with the police that create these divisive incidents we see on the news.

So putting the family back together so black children are born into stable, two-parent homes will go a long way to fixing many of the problems black people face today, including problems with the police. President Obama should have forcefully illuminated the broken state of black families, then outlined his ideas to put it back together. There are many ways to approach this, but one good place to start is to scale back well-intentioned but ineffective entitlement programs that encourage and enable single-motherhood, many of which the president himself unfortunately supports.

If he couldn’t have stomached this tough but true response, Obama could have at least given the example of how he leads his own family, which is indeed a stable two-parent black family.

3. ‘We Must Fix the Brokenness in Black Culture’

Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Data shows that the popularity of black kids decreases as their GPA increases, a trend not seen for white public school children. This means black kids pay a high social price for pursuing academic excellence. Research from psychologist Angela Neal-Barnett shows that things like taking an Advanced Placement class, taking an honors class, or—gasp—speaking standard English were behaviors many black students saw as “acting white” and thus carried a social cost.

Researchers are still working out the reasons for this unfortunate phenomenon, but I suspect it exists simply because many young black people are rarely challenged by teachers, parents, communities, and the media. That’s because: 1) It’s much easier to just blame racism, and 2) Challenging black veneration of underachievement might be seen as racist.

However, President Obama should have avoided the easy, cowardly approach of blaming racism and instead forcefully illustrated the problem, proclaiming that achieving excellence does not have a race attached to it, and we will have zero tolerance for blacks who ridicule other black folks for pursuing distinction.

There is also a destructive thug culture among some strains of the black community. Black journalist Cynthia Tucker Haynes beautifully states: “Somewhere along the way, a cadre of young black men and women began glorifying violence, misogyny and thuggery, accepting incarceration as inevitable, resigning themselves to lives on the margins of mainstream society. They created a thug culture that has been commodified — celebrated in music and movies, sold to poor adolescents in wretched neighborhoods as well as affluent teenagers in upscale communities.”

What more can be said? President Obama should have uttered these powerful words last night, then ended them with, “Therefore, we must demolish this thug culture that is destroying young black Americans. We will treat it the same as terrorism: pursue it, confront it, and destroy it.” That’s right, I just compared thug culture to terrorism. September 11, 2011 killed about 3,000 Americans, yet about 5,500 black men kill other black men annually. That’s almost two black 9/11s per year! So where’s the War Against Thugs™?

4. ‘The Police Are Not the Main Problem’

Over the past 35 years, a mind-bending 323,820 black people have been killed by other black people in America, far exceeding the number of police officers killed during that same timeframe. The data showsabout 71 blacks are killed by other blacks for every one black person killed by a white police officer. It is clear then, the real problem is black people killing each other.

Yes, cases of police misconduct should be confronted and handled promptly when they occur. Absolutely. But black deaths due to the police account for less than 2 percent of all black murders, so attacking the police must never be the main issue. President Obama should thus have stated forcefully, “Let us stop blaming the police, for they are not the ones killing black folks. Sadly, it is black folks who are killing each other. Therefore, we must solve the national problem of black murder.”

5. ‘Blaming Police Gets More Police Killed’

Rhetoric that frames police for the deep, systematic problems in the black community puts police lives in danger by riling up hatred and resentment towards them, and encourages the kind of cop killers we’ve seen in Dallas and Baton Rouge. This kind of rhetoric can’t be tolerated.

First, it’s not true. The police are the first line of defense in protecting black Americans from black criminals, who overwhelmingly target black victims. Second, it takes focus away from the real issues at the source of the problem: broken families, thug culture, entitlement programs that disincentivize family formation, and a culture of low achievement.

President Obama should have thus forcefully declared “We will never allow police lives to be put in jeopardy by dangerous rhetoric that blames them for brokenness in minority communities, a brokenness they did not cause and cannot fix.”

Thankfully for the president, I do not charge for this free post-mortem analysis. But for further consultations, we’ll have to talk.

Sheriff Clarke Is Right: There’s A War On Cops,"Nearly eight years after the historic election of Barack Obama as America’s first black president, we can see the disappointing result: a small-scale race war in America’s cities. That it’s a war was heralded by Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who denounced the recent attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge as “anarchy” in his speech at the Republican convention.

In an op-ed in The Hill, he went further, describing the attacks as “guerrilla urban warfare against the police.”

These attacks may not yet amount to a war—it’s only two shooters—but it is forming an ominous pattern, a series of spontaneous one-man insurgencies. It is no coincidence that both killers had military training and served during the War on Terror; they’re taking their cue from the enemy they were sent to fight.

Obviously, these were disturbed young men, and we will find many reasons why they went wrong. But they were both given a direction and justification by black nationalism and particularly by the idea, which has come to be accepted as an unquestioned truth by many, that racist police forces are out of control and randomly murdering young black men in large numbers. This is the narrative that fuels the Black Lives Matter protests, and it gave the Dallas and Baton Rouge shooters the sense that they were simply fighting back against a war on young black men.

It will be no surprise to you, I hope, that this narrative is completely wrong. Actual numbers about police shootings show nothing of the sort.

Numbers Tell the True Story

A while back, some of my friends coined what we call the Doctrine of Numerical Superiority—the idea that numbers and measurements always take precedence over narrative and story-telling. They’re all scientists and engineers, and this is their way of trying to push back on behalf of their method of thinking against the sloppy methods of narrative-driven journalism.

One of those friends, Jack Wakeland, helped me put together some of the numbers about mass shootings, and those numbers produce a very different story than the one we’ve been given. Jack runs down a few of the figures.

“While gunshot homicides are not incredibly rare events—there are about 13,000 a year—wrongful shooting deaths by police are rare.

“The US did not keep good statistics on police shootings until last year, probably because the police who keep most of the statistics really didn’t want to. In 2015, the number of fatal police shootings came to 986.

“Approximately 30% of people fatally shot by police are black and about 50% are non-Hispanic whites. To say that 40 to 50% of all violent crime is committed by blacks (even though they make up only 12% of the male population) puts these numbers into perspective.”

In other words, the number of black men killed by police is more or less in line with the percentage of violent criminals who are black. Other studies back this up.

“It is only through detailed statistical analyses of police use of force reports that one can actually find if there are racial disparities. In one such analysis no racial bias against black suspects was found in the use of deadly force. A small bias against black suspects was found in the frequency with which non-lethal force was used; but this was balanced by an equally small and opposite bias found in favor of black suspects in the use of deadly force.

“How many of these police shootings are bad? How many are tragic accidents? How many are acts of reckless negligence? How many are straight-up murder? There is no number on that. And with the universal history of men-at-arms sticking up for each other and covering for each other (in all nations and all cultures), it is impossible to be certain of the truth.

“All those truths about the ‘blue wall of silence’ being said, one has to think that the number of mistaken or criminal homicides committed by the police must be 10% or less of the total number shot dead. That comes to less than 90 a year.”

There Is No Wave of Police Shootings

Actually, an earlier Washington Post analysis concluded that “the kind of incidents that have ignited protests in many U.S. communities—most often, white police officers killing unarmed black men—represent less than 4 percent of fatal police shootings,” which would put the number closer to 40. And we know from the high-profile cases that have been thoroughly examined in the press—cases like Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri—that as the real facts come to light, they often either support the conclusion that the shooting was justified or create enough legitimate uncertainty to make prosecuting the officer impossible.

As I have pointed out before, any encounter between police and citizens is potentially dangerous. There is plenty of scope for misunderstandings, accidents, poor training, poor judgment (on both sides), and just plain bad luck to result in a police officer shooting a citizen to death over a misdemeanor offense like a traffic stop or selling loose cigarettes. There’s even more scope for shootings in which the facts are so murky and confused that it is hard to tell a justified shooting from an unjustified one.

So it’s actually remarkable that it doesn’t happen more often.

‘In a nation of 320 million people, these events are less common than being killed by a tornado.’

But even if the number of illegitimate shootings is fewer than 90 per year, Jack points out, “as criminal and law-enforcement activity peaks in the summer months, they can occur several times in one week.” Two weeks before Philando Castile, for example, there was a similar case in Fresno involving a young white man. Yet, as Jack points out, “In a nation of 320 million people, these events are less common than being killed by a tornado.”

“In an innumerate nation, tens of millions of people are being led to believe that wrongful police killings are common and that they’re oppressing an entire race of men. They’re teasing this very big conclusion about disparate racial impacts from two or three cases out of an unidentified (and virtually unidentifiable) set of less than 90 cases of wrongful killing per year. To say such a conclusion is statistically and logically invalid does not capture its absurdity.”

That leads us to Sheriff Clarke’s other big claim, that the narrative of a police war on young black men is being pushed by “the false tales of the revolutionary Marxist forces, who most recently have rebranded themselves from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter.” In effect, he is accusing them of acting as a political front for the shooters, providing them their narrative and their sense of serving a cause; Sinn Fein to the shooters’ IRA.

It is going too far to describe all BLM supporters as “revolutionary Marxists,” but the wider pattern fits. Charges of racism and especially of systematic racist murders by the police have long been a staple of the far left, no matter what the statistics, because they serve a purpose. The far left has never been interested in racism per se. They have been interested in using accusations of racism to undermine the moral legitimacy of America’s social, political, and economic system. If the system is fundamentally racist and corrupt, then it all needs to be torn down, justifying “fundamental change” along the lines the left proposes.

Obama, The Divider

That brings us to President Obama’s role, which Clarke also briefly alludes to.

It has become a bit of a cliché to complain that Obama promised us racial healing but delivered the opposite, to which he will reply that promises of magical transformation to a new age of racial harmony were always unrealistic. You don’t say. But that misses the real issue. People didn’t expect racial politics would magically improve. They expected racial politics to improve because Obama would do something concrete and significant to help them improve. They probably expected that, as the first black president, he would have the standing and moral legitimacy to speak to both sides, to recognize legitimate grievances while tamping down the flames of conflict.

We hoped Obama could articulate the humiliation of those who feel they are being unfairly targeted by police, but place those fears within a rational perspective.

They were expecting him to follow the example set by George Washington in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion. Insurgencies and guerrilla warfare against the federal government are not exactly new. In 1794, President Washington led 13,000 militia troops to put down a violent protest against a tax on whiskey, which was an important source of income for Western settlers in the Appalachians. He did so on the grounds that, while the grievance was legitimate, “if the laws are to be so trampled upon with impunity, and a minority…is to dictate to the majority, there is an end put at one stroke to republican government…, for some other man or society may dislike another law and oppose it with equal propriety until all laws are prostrate, and everyone will carve for himself.”

But the reason Washington could put down this insurrection so easily is because he had the moral authority to do so. As a man who had staked everything on the American Revolution, who had voluntarily relinquished power several times before, he had a reputation for unwavering dedication to the cause of liberty. He had a unique moral authority to speak to the rebels and to their supporters, and to demand that they disperse.

We might have hoped that President Obama would exercise some small echo of this authority when dealing with America’s racial tensions. We hoped he could articulate the humiliation of those who feel they are being unfairly targeted by police, but place those fears within a rational perspective, defend the role of the police in maintaining the rule of law, and tell the Black Lives Matter agitators to stand down.

But I never had such expectations, because I knew how deeply wedded he is to the far left narrative and its need to delegitimize American institutions so that politicians like him can “fundamentally transform” them. That’s why, eight years later, Sheriff Clarke and other leaders of law enforcement find themselves forced onto a war footing, an understandable siege mentality that will probably only make things worse.

That’s what happens when we don’t have leaders who are able to put facts above narrative and the good of the country above their predetermined political agenda.

‘Law And Order’ Won’t Save The Republican Party,"The Trump campaign has tried to push a few key narratives at the Republican convention. They haven’t succeeded, mind you, because they keep getting pushed off message by unforced errors, like plagiarizing bromides from Michelle Obama and treating Ted Cruz like dirt for six months, then inviting him to knife the nominee in prime time.

But the convention’s intended themes tell us the messages Trump’s people are hoping he can run on, and we can expect those themes to return during the rest of the campaign. One of the main themes is law and order. They hope to respond to the recent attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge by promoting themselves as the answer to runaway crime and a war on police.

But if the Left has constructed a false narrative about out-of-control racist cops, Republicans are constructing a false narrative about runaway crime. Rudy Giuliani summed up this narrative: “The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. They fear for our children, they fear for themselves, they fear for our police officers.” Then, in a riff on the Trump campaign slogan, he proclaimed, “It’s time to make America safe again.”

I understand why Giuliani would embrace this theme. There are only two reasons he has any prominence on the national political stage: he helped break the crime wave in New York City in the 1990s, and he steered the city through the terrorist attacks on 9/11. So it’s no wonder crime and terrorism are the themes he keeps returning to. When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

The problem is that the crime wave remains broken. I sincerely doubt that the “vast majority” of voters “do not feel safe,” and if they do, the fear is largely unjustified. Recently, I took a look at the data about police shootings that undermines the Left’s narrative about racist cops. Now let’s look at some of the data that undermines the Right’s emerging “law and order” narrative.

Take a Look at Chicago

Let’s just take one microcosm, one which, as a former resident, I know pretty well: Chicago. It has become a standard retort, when President Obama uses a mass shooting to push for gun control, to point to the most recent weekend of shootings in his home city’s high-crime neighborhoods.

Chicago certainly does have a problem with crime, policing, and shootings in some of its outlying neighborhoods. I’ve written before about how the city has been split into two tiers: prosperous upper-middle-class neighborhoods downtown, and impoverished, failing neighborhoods to the south and west.

Yet even in Chicago, overall crime is continuing its long-term decline. Despite sensationalist press headline like “Chicago’s Murder Rate Soars 72% in 2016; Shootings Up More than 88%,” the Chicago Tribune‘s extensive statistics on crime show only a small seasonal uptick in violent crime. Meanwhile, here is their graph of the 15-year trend:

Here is an even longer-term trend for Chicago’s annual number of murders:

Yes, there was a massive crime wave that started in the 1960s and didn’t begin to subside until the 1990s. No, it is not returning, at least not yet. The data shows small ups and down within a level of killing that has been trending down to that of the pre-crime-wave era. This is in line with national-level statistics.

But what about the much-discussed “Ferguson Effect”? This narrative holds that the police shooting of a young black man in Ferguson, Missouri, a legitimate self-defense shooting distorted by the Left into the racist murder of a defenseless teenager, has been used to delegitimize the police and cause a surge in crime in big cities like Baltimore and Chicago.

But the data is ambiguous. There has been some recent increase in violence in big cities, but it is not clearly correlated to the kind of ferment created by Ferguson-related protests or the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s summed up in this graph from the Washington Post.

Yes, there have been big upticks in Baltimore and Cleveland, presumably in response to the Freddie Gray and Tamir Rice cases, respectively, But there were also big increases in places like Nashville, Denver, Oklahoma City, and Minneapolis, while other potential hot spots, like New York City, showed only very small increases.

But what about Dallas and Baton Rouge? Don’t they show an increase in shootings of police officers? Yet those are just two events within a large context of long-term decline. Here is a graph of the number of police killed in the line of duty, from the National Law Enforcement Officer’s Memorial Fund.

These figures include both shootings and traffic fatalities. But so far this decade, the average number of shooting deaths of police, 53, has been outnumbered by the average number of traffic fatalities, 55. By comparison, the average number of deaths from lightning strikes is 51.

This Won’t Resonate with the Public

As someone who remembers the later years of the late-twentieth-century crime wave, when crime kept getting worse and worse and we all feared it was just going to keep increasing, I don’t think we should take the current respite from violent crime for granted. I remember when the police seemed like a “thin blue line” protecting us from anarchy, and that’s why I’m so offended by the current practice of rushing to judgment every time some activist with an axe to grind accuses a police officer of a wrongful shooting.

I’m offended by the current practice of rushing to judgment every time some activist with an axe to grind accuses a police officer.

I certainly think there is reason to fear that recent attempts to delegitimize the police and to dismantle the law enforcement policies that broke the crime wave will lead to a resurgence of crime. But it hasn’t happened yet, and acting as if it has is a narrative just as false as the “racist cop” narrative.

More to the point, it is politically foolish. When Giuliani asserts that “the vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe,” this may resonate with a base of existing Trump supporters, which includes a lot of older voters—people my age and up, who formed their opinions on crime during the height of the crime wave—and, sad to say, a small faction of alt-right types who are eager to gin up an irrational fear of blacks and Mexicans.

But if they think this is going to resonate with the general public—if they’re hoping it will bring enough “law and order” voters to the polls to compensate for Trump’s amazing talent at repelling non-white voters—they are likely to be disappointed.

“Law and order” helped save the Republican Party once, thirty-odd years ago. It won’t save it this time.

Black Lives Matter Doesn’t Know What It Wants,"Although the Black Lives Matter movement seems to have a formal cause, it struggles to settle on any specific tasks, steps, or legislation beyond catalyzing rage and indignation. The platform is practically immortal. There can never be a time when their mission will be accomplished, the standard can be rested, or wounds healed.

Black lives matter. Of course the vast majority of us believe and defend this proposition. Most of us also believe racism is still present around us. Almost no one believes violence against innocent police officers is acceptable. But I still have significant reservations about supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Here’s why.

The movement suffers from indirection. At blacklivesmatter.com, they explain, “Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks’ contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.”

The statement is at once bold and nebulous. It both affirms black issues and culture and establishes a broad platform for anti-racism. Although not stated, the ostensible goal of Black Lives Matter is to decrease police violence against blacks and, by extension, everyone. The loss of any life is tragic; the disproportionate loss of black lives at the hands of police is egregious. The shameful history of race relations in the United States makes this disproportionality even more painful and poignant.

Our (and BLM’s) yearning for equity and justice—if not in general, at least from the institutions and individuals sworn to protect us and uphold the peace—is intuitive. Unfortunately, it is also simplistic. It is a fact that black people are disproportionately targeted and aggressed by the police. But it is also a fact that black people disproportionately live in low-income communities that have a disproportionate level of crime.

Statistics like “25% of the people killed by the police so far this year were Black, even though they only represent 13% of the population” imply a misleading generality: They seem to suggest that in any interaction with police anywhere, black people are more likely to experience violence. Although this may actually be the case, the causal story is probably much more complex. I do not mean to excuse unjustified police violence, but if we really want to reduce deaths by police, we should pay attention to the underlying dynamics that produce those deaths. “Racism” is too easily misunderstood and too nebulous a dynamic to productively oppose and address.

Don’t Just Blame Police; Blame Everyone

I have no doubt that many cops witness gun violence frequently. The vast majority of that violence takes place in poor, minority neighborhoods. Still, I have no problem criticizing police violence or punishing guilty officers. I suspect the ego involved in penal authority attracts some of the best and worst kind of people. But at least part of the responsibility for their racism is my own. It is exacerbated by poor schools, the bad immigration policies, perpetuated ghettos, and social dynamics.

To some extent, we are all responsible for the racism we see exhibited in the police force. I have lived in downtown Minneapolis, about five miles from both Falcon Heights and St. Anthony’s. It is an incredibly diverse city bloated with gangs, ghettos, and immigrants from Laos and Somalia. I loved my time there and the people I met from a variety of religions and races. But I would have been blind to ignore the resulting complexities.

If the eyes of our police have been colored, it’s probably not the result of an ideological hatred towards black people but the messy result of complex and dysfunctional social structures—the very complexities we send our police officers to clean up. So while racism exists, we all shoulder some of the responsibility, which should make us generous in our critique even if more committed to change.

Unintended Consequences Still Matter

A good counter example of an effective organization with a similar political motive was the organization Freedom to Marry. This organization advocating gay marriage had a clear legislative goal, deep and dynamic organization, and specific plans for specific ends. Once they accomplished their goal, they dissolved the organization, hence why I’m speaking in past tense. Now all that remains on their website is the story of their success, from inception to fruition. While there is a lot of energy behind Black Lives Matter, I question its direction, productivity, and effectiveness.

The problem with indirection in Black Lives Matter is deeper than ineffectuality. A movement calling for protests, revolts, and rallies plays with fire. There is no room for ambiguity when a protester’s blood begins to boil, a rally becomes lively, or an ideology is given tinder. Such potent and deadly energy must be harnessed towards productivity or else risk erupting in unpredictable and catastrophic directions, as was the case recently in Dallas and Baton Rouge.

Of course the vast majority of protestors would never condone shooting a police officer, and the organization cannot be held entirely responsible for all actions of its members. As best I can tell, the Black Lives Matter movement has channeled the nonviolent protest of Martin Luther King Jr. over an early Malcom X. I am sure they are as horrified as I am by the violence that took place at their protest in Dallas. But the movement is not entirely innocent of the crimes, either.

An organization that actively promotes civil distress through inflammatory rhetoric carries some responsibility for the resulting consequences, even if unintended. Even if an organization denounces violence, if it creates violence there is still a conversation to be had. This should sound oddly familiar. Isn’t that the very thing Black Lives Matter says about police brutality? Every police organization denounces dishonesty, brutality, and racism. But if dishonesty, brutality, and racism still happen, suddenly what they claim to preach doesn’t matter so much. Perhaps police forces and Black Lives Matter have something in common here.

If Black Lives Matter is indeed channeling the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era, they should establish more pointed and particular goals—specifically legislative goals. In Selma, the civil activists protested for voting rights. In Montgomery, they protested racial segregation on the public transit system that a little over a year later culminated in the Supreme Court decision of Browder vs Gayle. Until the Black Lives Matter movement establishes specific goals beyond inciting indignation, it remains volatile and predisposed towards violence.

"Michael Jordan Speaks For Racial Equality, Police Respect","In an essay for “The Undefeated,” a sports blog that focuses on race and sports, Michael Jordan spoke out about the shootings of unarmed black men and targeted police attacks.

The legendary NBA player and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee broke his habit of keeping quiet about divisive political issues, writing that he could “no longer stay silent.”

As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.



I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.



Over the past three decades I have seen up close the dedication of the law enforcement officers who protect me and my family. I have the greatest respect for their sacrifice and service. I also recognize that for many people of color their experiences with law enforcement have been different than mine. I have decided to speak out in the hope that we can come together as Americans, and through peaceful dialogue and education, achieve constructive change.

Jordan has also donated $1 million to two organizations: the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The former is a newly established training program that aims to improve relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

Although Jordan wrote that his donations won’t solve the problem, he said he hopes it will enable the organizations to make a “positive difference.”

“The problems we face didn’t happen overnight and they won’t be solved tomorrow,” he wrote. “But if we all work together, we can foster greater understanding, positive change and create a more peaceful world for ourselves, our children, our families and our communities.”

Can’t We Mourn Police Instead Of Exploiting Their Deaths?,"Handwringing of the PC kind is a ritual exertion in my solidly Democrat town. Chappaqua is not called the Upper Upper West Side for nothing.

On July 11, our town board organized a “Community Gathering in a Time of Grief and Sorrow” to mourn victims of the Dallas shootings. It was the second such liturgy in four weeks. The first convened after the Orlando rampage. Contrast between the two was telling. The first was well-attended, self-congratulatory, even festive. The second was sparse and ambivalent.

Gun control was a subtext of both. Town dignitaries replayed Hillary’s response to the rampage in San Bernadino: “We must take action to stop gun violence now.” Mention of totalitarian Islam was inadmissible in the first gathering. Any recognition of black hostility toward whites—festering since the 1970s and detailed by David Horowitz in “Hating Whitey” (1999)—was absent in the second.

It’s Almost Out of a Clichéd Movie

The June rally began with a cantor from Temple Beth El leading the crowd in singing “Ya’asch Shalom,” a prayer for peace. A Congregational minister led “Amazing Grace,” and quoted Martin Luther King Jr. (“Hate confuses life; love harmonizes it”). Reluctant to place Omar Mateen’s murder spree in an ideological context, she crooned: “For those who decide to kill each other and cause such sorrow, I truly have a hard time believing that they have experienced love, absolute love, unconditional love.”

That Mateen had experienced Islam went unsaid. Nondenominational hate was the culprit in Orlando. Love was our shield and defender. Next day’s headline in local press read: “Love Triumphs at Chappaqua Vigil for Orlando Victims.”

Town Supervisor Robert Greenstein served the obligatory candy: “More love and less hate stands for a better tomorrow.” The crowd was encouraged to reach out lovingly to the LGBT community. Between rainbow flags and compulsory cant came calls for gun control. Listen to the lady cleric: “I pray in the aftermath of this horror we can find ways to support and honor our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer friends and neighbors while also being mindful of the cost that gun violence brings to many communities every day.”

Congresswoman Nita Lowey dispatched an envoy to convey her vow to ban guns. Undermining the Second Amendment is worth it “If it stops one person from doing something awful.”

A member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America read a self-referential essay by an unnamed gay woman whose sense of safety Orlando had shattered: “Last night I kissed my girlfriend in public in a simple act of love and protest that straight people participate in without thought or fear.” The lament was received solemnly, as if gay discomposure were the issue at stake.

On hand to keep attention fixed on guns and gays—and prevent any awkward references to Islam—was Khusry Elley of the Upper Westchester Muslim Society and Westchester Coalition Against Islamophobia. Elley, a key figure in the BCCI money laundering scandal of the late 1980s, is an unsettling fixture at public events like this.

He is former chairman of WESPAC (Westchester People’s Action Coalition), a coven of left-wing activists. Journalist Daniel Greenfield wrote on WESPAC last year, declaring them anti-Israel and Hamas-friendly. Elley’s own blog still retains older anti-Semitic comments that a man less confident of his own immunity would have removed by now. In January, 2008, he wrote that “the Jewish lobby has gone from strength to strength” and now dictates foreign policy. A month later, he called the United States “captive to a minority with money” and added: “No one can explain to me how a great nation like the US allows itself to be dictated by a few million Jews and the Zionist nation of Israel.”

Elley has praised Sayed Qutub, the Muslim Brotherhood theorist seminal to al-Qaeda. He calls him “a man demonized by the West but his book Social Justice in Islam should be required reading for all Muslims.” The San Bernadino killers thought so, too. Qutub’s Leninist-inspired writings were found among their effects.

Yet here was Elley extricating Islam from any role in the Orlando shootings: “It appears the only crime in the eyes of the killer was the sexual orientation of the victims. We should urge our lawmakers for the harshest measures for hate crimes and take whatever measures are available to prevent such dastardly acts.”

Our local florist donated long-stemmed pink roses to the occasion. The library honored the event by placing a selection of LGBT books on a prominent display stand inside the entrance.

We Love to Talk about Blacks and Gays, But Not Police

The timbre of July’s gathering was strikingly different. It was a schizophrenic event that strained to honor five dead officers and, at the same time, bow heads for two black victims of police racism. The crowd was thinner. There were no incantations about love’s healing power, no call to reach out to men and women in law enforcement.

Dozens of police and firemen came from across Westchester to remember their colleagues killed protecting Black Lives Matter protesters. All were in dress uniforms, their badges covered with black armbands. Formalities opened with the Emerald Society bagpipers and a presentation by the police department’s color guard. The president of the local school board led the Pledge of Allegiance. The names of the five dead officers were read aloud.

Then the talks began. Ceremony went off-key from there. The chief of police and the president of the local Police Benevolent Association gave the eulogies. Chief Ferry felt obliged to defend militarized weaponry in police hands to counter “militarization of criminals.” Officiating clergy and bureaucrats ascended swiftly to the Bigger Issues: gun control, “disparity in justice,” and covert support for the anti-cop pieties Ferry had just rejected.

Supervisor Greenstein set the tone. He was suitably aggrieved (by all the lives lost) but in that double-minded way President Obama would adopt next day in Dallas. After obligatory commonplaces about honor of service, Greenstein threw meat to the very movement that prompted a black sniper to slaughter five white policemen: “Americans of all races and all backgrounds are outraged by police misconduct. It is unacceptable. When one of us is victimized we all suffer.”

Chief Ferry felt obliged to defend militarized weaponry in police hands to counter ‘militarization of criminals.’

In other words: Those officers should not have been murdered; nevertheless . . . . Besides, the overriding issue lay elsewhere: “Whether the event stems from terrorism, hate crimes or any other motive is irrelevant. Gun violence as a tool of hatred targeting race, gender, sexual preference, profession or any other reason cannot be tolerated. We must say no to gun violence.”

The source of hatred in Dallas went unmentioned. Anti-white animus is a progressive motif that precedes the events of Dallas. It is also a taboo subject, the silence yielding covert complicity in what Jim Sleeper in “Liberal Racism” (1997) called “the color-coding of American life.”

Not one speaker uttered a word against the dangers of making race an organizing principle of our civic life. Instead, the tenor of things affirmed Sleeper’s comment of 20 years ago: “Liberalism no longer curbs discrimination. It invites it. It does not expose racism; it recapitulates and, sometimes, reinvents it.”

We Are Not in Selma Any More

The racial politics of Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a virulent product of that re-invention. Its website states: “Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.”

The ambiguity of his comment insinuated a moral equivalence between dead police and their murderer.

BLM decries the many ways “violence is inflicted on Black folks across the world” and refuses to behave while “white supremacy and antiBlackness live and thrive in every society, culture, and part of our world.” Stating its aim of “(re)building the Black Liberation movement,” the website lapses into radical left boilerplate that hints at a larger game: “Black queer and trans folks bear a unique burden from a hetero-patriarchal society that disposes of us like garbage and simultaneously fetishizes us and profits off of us, and that is state violence.”

No, Toto, we are not in Selma anymore. But local Dems refuse to notice.

They brought back Khusro Elley. With him came under-the-radar sympathy with the BLM movement. All innuendo, Elley mourned the “unfortunate and unnecessary deaths” of the past week. The ambiguity of his comment insinuated a moral equivalence between dead police and their murderer. He waxed bolder: “We are outraged by the killing of African American men and women.” Then the punch line, a veiled accusation that had to sear the marrow of every officer listening: “I would rather be Muslim than black in America.”

A rabbi followed, admonishing against indifference with quotes from Elie Wiesel, an Auschwitz survivor. But indifference to whom? To what? The implicit Holocaust reference suggested solidarity with black grievance, not with the uniformed men and women standing in front of him.

Sky Lanterns in the Dark

The Congregational minister appeared again to deliver another posy to gun control: “I truly pray I am not standing here in another month for another vigil for another senseless act of violence.”

America’s race industry is advantageous to the caliphate’s advance men.

There was nothing senseless about the Dallas murders. They were the inevitable response to a toxic ideology that rationalizes the spilling of Pig’s Blood. Micah Johnson set out to kill white people, specifically white law enforcement. According to his Facebook page (since removed), he had joined the Mississippi branch of the Black Panther Party. Johnson was an incendiary retread in the cast of Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, and Eldridge Cleaver in his cop-shooting days.

Those half-forgotten names represent a racial antagonism that considers itself justified in the name of historic grievance and claims of ongoing persecution. As a poster stated on the Facebook page of the African American Defense League on July 18: “Where was ‘All Lives Matter’ between 1619 and 1968?”

The character of Elley’s participation in these interfaith clambakes sends a signal: America’s race industry is advantageous to the caliphate’s advance men. A gun grab, too, has uses. His presence serves as warning that our existence is intolerable to some others, possibly even those who pray with us. But it is an alarm we prefer not to hear.

This month, the florist sent no roses. The library featured no relevant books. No one read an essay by a police widow. It was left to volunteers in the Chappaqua Fire Department to release sky lanterns into the gathering dark in honor of the dead.

Democrats’ Convention Is The Victim Group Olympics,"The Democratic National Convention this week in Philadelphia is Democrats’ chance to offer their vision for America. With the Republican National Convention ending last week, Democrats and their allies in the media attempted to paint Donald Trump and the RNC’s message as “dark.”

However, it’s actually the Democrats’ strategy of dividing America into victimized groups that is truly dark, as it creates discord and division for political gain. Let’s look at this week’s speaker lineup at the DNC to see this divisiveness in action.

Exploiting Family Tragedies

The speaker lineup includes a group called Mothers of the Movement, which consists of the mothers of black men killed either by police or someone else, including Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Dontré Hamilton, and Sandra Bland, among others.

Consistent with their strategy of dividing America into groups of victims that Democratic Party handouts and programs must save, this group’s messaging consists of three components: 1) Blame police for the deaths of black men they shoot, 2) Blame (white) racism for black people killing each other in such dramatically high numbers, and 3) Blame guns for the problems of crime and violent interactions with police in the black community—then call for further restrictions on gun rights.

Let’s be clear: everyone, myself included, sympathizes with the suffering and the loss of these women. I can’t imagine the pain of losing a child. Yet the message of Mothers of the Movement backs the Democrats’ dark strategy of division and victimization. For one, the gun control agenda they push amounts to punishing law-abiding American gun owners for the actions of criminals, who are made out to be victims of guns, not products of failed families, a dysfunctional culture, and failed policies that keep black people locked in poverty.

Second, blaming our police when criminals fight back or resist arrest makes it appear that the Democratic Party is defending criminals as victims while attacking the good guys as oppressors. Third, blaming white people for the dramatic problem of crime in black communities—a major plank of the Black Lives Matter platform—seems unfair, and as if they are avoiding a central cause of this problem, which is deep dysfunction in the black community. For example, many Americans watching this week are asking, “Where are the fathers?” and “Why did your son become a criminal or fight with the police in the first place?”

The GOP should capitalize on the Democratic strategy of division and victimization by defining itself as the party that stands for police and all law-abiding citizens of every race. They should contrast themselves with the Democratic Party, which defines black people as victims and the police, gun-owning Americans, and whites as enemies for the sake of securing a minority voting bloc.

Enabling and Apologizing for Law-Breakers

Further consistent with the theme of dividing America into victim classes, another group speaking at the DNC are “DREAMers.” “DREAMer” is the word Democrats use to describe the children of illegal immigrants who were also not born in the United States. A big agenda item of President Obama and the Democrats (and even Jeb Bush, which is one reason he lost the Republican primary so spectacularly) has been to push for legal status for this group.

Yet to many Americans, pushing to legalize those who came here illegally seems like an attack on fairness and law and order, rewarding lawbreakers who cheated our system. Further, studies show illegal immigration harms the poorest Americans and carries the threat of increased terrorism.

The GOP response should be to define itself as the party of fairness and of defending Americans from external threats, including illegal immigration. This is in contrast to the Democrats, who’ll go to any length to create a new victim group if positioning itself as the savior of that group will produce political gain, regardless of the division created and the harm to Americans accrued in the process.

Projecting Wrong Motives Onto Violence

Additionally, survivors of the horrible Charleston church shooting will speak. That shooting was of course an unspeakable, indefensible act. But I expect this presentation to further reveal the Democratic strategy of cultivating victim groups and then making itself the savior of those groups against their alleged oppressors—in this case whites and those who fly the Confederate flag. (As if the Confederate flag is making 5,500 black people kill each other every year!)

This approach also reveals another fundamental problem with Democrats’ philosophy: their willingness to claim systematic racism for the isolated act of a crazy, despicable individual such as Dylann Roof. They do such things while also typically claiming there is no systematic problem with Islamic terrorism despite repeated, consistent attacks from Muslims in the name of their religion on behalf of ISIS.

This presents an opportunity for the GOP to not only clearly showcase the Democrats’ confused beliefs towards extremism, but also to point out their willingness to divide the nation by designating gun owners and the Confederate flag as enemies for political gain, even though those are not the cause of this horrible incident.

Mischaracterizing Paperwork Mistakes for Political Gain

Next up, a young woman from Kansas named Jensen Walcott tells how she was fired by her employer, Pizza Studio, for asking why she was paid less than her male counterpart who started the same job on the same day. The obvious implication is that her lower pay compared to her male co-worker was due to discrimination, and she was fired because the company supported this discrimination.

But further investigation shows her lower pay was not due to discrimination or bias at all (her boss was a woman), but a paperwork mistake! Indeed, Ashleigh Siefker, Pizza Studio’s executive director of operations and a woman, has personally instituted anti-discrimination policies at the company, and indicated the pay discrepancy in this case was an HR mistake, not discrimination. The boss who incorrectly set Walcott’s pay was fired for the mistake. But don’t expect something as minor as the truth to stop the narrative of victimization that is the bread and butter of the Democratic Party.

Walcott’s story and the DNC’s shameless twisting of the facts in an attempt to show discrimination that wasn’t actually there is yet another example of creating division for political gain, this time with the victim group being women. This presents a great opportunity for the GOP to highlight Democrats’ negative and divisive strategy of dividing people into groups, then declaring each one a victim of discrimination, even when no discrimination is actually taking place.

The Democratic strategy is on full display this week: divide America into victimized groups, then showcase speakers and viewpoints that tell the victim narrative while blaming the alleged oppressors. The victim groups of choice this week will be blacks, illegal immigrants, gays, and women. The oppressors are those bad Republicans, whites, Christians, and men.

Time will tell which party’s approach gets the moderate swing voters. The GOP has a strong chance if they clearly highlight the harm done to national unity by Democrats’ dark strategy of division, victimization, and blame.

How To Explain Cop Killers To Kids,"A sweet little red-haired girl I know recently asked her mother a very difficult question. It wasn’t an academically difficult question like “Why can flies walk on the ceiling,” the kind many parents fear will embarrassingly expose their lack of scientific knowledge. Nor was it difficult in the “I’m not ready for this conversation yet” sense, found in questions like “Where do babies come from?” No, this little girl asked her mother a spiritually difficult question. She asked, “Why do bad people want to kill my daddy?”

You see, that girl’s father is a police officer, and she knows what her daddy does every day. He goes to work to help people, keep them safe, and stop criminals from hurting us. While I’d imagine this little girl has always understood that there are bad people who want to run away from her father when he’s trying to catch them, she’s picked up on a new, more aggressive form of evil in the air, manifested recently in Dallas and in Baton Rouge. She’s learned there are people who have never even met her father but who want to take his life and the lives of other police officers. So, when all her daddy wants to do is help people, why do some people hate him? Why do bad people want to kill her daddy?

How does a mother answer a question like this? How do you even begin to explain the depths of this evil to a child who just finished first grade? I can only imagine that, in recent days, many children have asked their parents to help them make sense of all this.

So, for the sake of that sweet little-red haired girl’s parents, and for any other parents needing some help answering a rather difficult spiritual question, here is how I would explain things to my own young children and to the young children of my congregation.

Little One, Let Me Explain

Everyone in the world needs to be at peace with God. Even if people say they don’t believe in God, this need is something we all experience one way or another. Just as we all need to know that our earthly fathers love us, we all need to know that our Father in heaven loves us, even if we don’t know or understand who that Father is.

In the words of the Bible, that Father tells us he loves us. In the Bible, God tells us we have his love because Jesus took away all our sins when he died on the cross and rose from the grave. In the Bible, God tell us Jesus has given us everything we need to be his Father’s children and to live with him forever.

But the devil doesn’t want us to be at peace with God, and so the devil tries to get us to believe the opposite of what God says in the Bible. The devil wants us to believe it didn’t do us any good when Jesus died on the cross. The devil wants us to believe God won’t stop being angry at our sins until we do something to take his anger away and make him love us. Sometimes the devil convinces people that the best way to make God love them is to hurt other people, including police officers who are only trying to help people.

Even though most police officers are good people, sometimes bad police officers do things they shouldn’t do—hurt people, harass people, sometimes even shoot people when they don’t have to. When people see this happen to their friends or their family, it makes them angry, especially if those bad police officers don’t get punished.

Likewise, sometimes people think police officers treat them unfairly just because they have the same color skin or dress the same way as other people who have broken the law. In moments like this, it’s okay for people to tell those in their government or their country they think they’re being treated unfairly, as long as they remember that God commands us to forgive the people who have wronged us, just as he forgave us in Christ. But when people won’t listen to God and hold onto their anger at bad cops, the devil often convinces some of those angry people that what God actually wants is for them to hate all cops, even the good ones who are trying to help them.

We’re Broken in So Many Ways, Baby

Likewise, when people make sinful decisions in their lives, they often want to blame others for the results. When they can’t get good jobs or when people think poorly of them because they’ve gone to jail for selling drugs or stealing things, they want to blame the police officers who caught them instead of blaming themselves for doing things that were wrong, especially if they see that people with a different skin color or who have more money don’t get punished as harshly as they do.

When this happens, God tells them they should accept the punishment they deserve and be at peace knowing they won’t be punished for those sins in heaven. But sometimes the devil convinces a handful of these angry individuals that God never said any of this, that God hates the same people they hate, and that in order to buy God’s love, they must hurt the kind of people who were only trying to protect their neighbors.

Other times, especially with men, when their fathers abandon them or when something prevents their brains from working the right way, they have a hard time knowing what it means to be a man. They have a hard time believing God when he says that being a man is all about protecting people, laying down your life in service of your wife and your children, and doing the kinds of things that good police officers do every day.

In their weakness and confusion, sometimes the devil convinces a few of these men that being a man is all about hating people who have power over them, and that God will love them if they do anything to take that power for themselves, including taking the lives of good, faithful police officers who obey the law, treat people with honor, and love their families more than anything in this world.

We all need to know that God loves us. And God has told us that he does. But because a few people have believed the devil’s lies, they’ve become convinced the only way to win the love of God is by hating their neighbor, believing untrue things about police officers to fuel that hatred, suggesting that police officers get what they deserve when people murder them, shouting that they want the world to be filled with dead cops, and even by firing their guns at the very men who have sworn to protect and defend them.

Even if these people say they want to take the lives of law enforcement because of racism or police brutality, the real reason for their bloodlust is that they don’t believe God when he tells them that Jesus has already won for them the love that can’t be purchased by anyone’s blood but his own.

Pray for Those Who Persecute You

So where do parents go from there? Once our children know why people want to do evil, how do we comfort them in response to that evil? The answer is the same as it always has been. We go to church and we hear how Christ crushed the devil’s skull with his nail-pierced foot at Calvary, promising us that we never need to believe a word that wicked foe ever speaks because the love of God is already our eternal possession.

We point our children to the baptismal font and promise them we never need to believe the lies of the devil because, in those waters, we were covered in all the righteousness that God requires to call us his children and enter his kingdom. We read our Bibles every day, and we watch Jesus’s word of peace take away the anger Satan has used to corrupt so many. We fold our hands every night, praying not only that God would deliver us from the evil one, but that he would also deliver those who are currently stuck in Satan’s jaws.

We pray that God would end all threats of violence by replacing hatred with love in the hearts of those who are breathing out murderous threats towards police officers or anyone else. As long as sinners continue to hunger for the death of those who protect and serve, we pray God would send his holy angels to protect each and every one of those officers, that he may bless them all to get home safely every night, to take their sweet little red-haired daughters in their arms, and to know that they can be at peace with each other because Jesus has given them peace with God.

Did Black Lives Matter Just Oust NYPD’s Police Chief?,"One day after Black Lives Matter protesters attempted to occupy New York’s City Hall Park, one of their central demands was met. With the resignation of Police Commissioner Bill Bratton Tuesday, the group can claim a victory in its effort to transform policing in America’s largest city.



Although Bratton’s resignation had been rumored for some time and he and the mayor deny protests influenced the move, BLM activists toasted the decision today. Republican Staten Island city councilman Joe Borelli says: “Essentially, they got what they wanted. Causation is not relevant, perception is.” The unmistakable perception is that the move, long in the planning or not, is a concession to protesters.

Along with Bratton’s removal, the protesters demanded that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) be disbanded, with its budget redirected to community activism. If, for some reason, the city government refuses to disband the police, protesters demand that “broken windows” policing, first championed by Bratton in the 1990s, be abolished.

Broken windows is a police practice of focusing on small, quality-of-life crimes to stem larger, more violent crimes. Its implementation is widely credited with New York City’s steep drop in crime under former mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.

Black Lives Matter Protests

Late into Monday night, protesters in City Hall Park gathered and chanted “How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D,” as NYPD officers looked on. According to some protesters I spoke with, the plan was to stay in the park indefinitely, in the style of Occupy Wall Street. While that did not happen, a large gathering of hundreds did essentially take over the park, which was cordoned off by police and fencing.

The atmosphere swung from jubilant to angry as activists poured out their frustrations over what they view as a racist and corrupt police force. One protester told me “this movement is trying to bring to light stories from people who have no other access to [presenting] information.” But other protesters took a harder line, insisting New York City’s police force was beyond redemption and must be done away with.

By midnight, the protest had mostly dissipated, and a relative calm was restored to the downtown Manhattan neighborhood. According to Gothamist, the protesters left to go to 8 Spruce Street, a privately owned park where approximately 100 stayed the night. There were no arrests.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, was a champion of Occupy Wall Street. While running for mayor in 2013 he said, “Occupy Wall Street pulled the growing crisis of income inequality out into the light of day.” He was also at speaker at the occupation of Zuccotti Park 2011. This makes for an awkward situation, as his city government is now being occupied. Although unlikely to fall to a Republican in next year’s general election, there have been murmurs, specifically from black city leaders, of a primary challenge.

With pressure already building from the black community, Monday’s protests turned the screws a little tighter. Bratton’s resignation Tuesday may well provide an exhaust valve for Black Lives Matter’s anger at the NYPD and mayor. While it is possible Bratton’s decision to step down was already scheduled for Tuesday, its announcement provides a clear victory for those who took to New York’s streets Monday night.

Nobody Elected Black Lives Matter

If the mayor and police commissioner’s decision, or even the timing of the announcement, was influenced by Monday’s protests, it represents a dangerous surrender. Mayor de Blasio was elected to serve New York City, not Black Lives Matter. And nobody elected the latter. Even to allow the appearance that protesters are influencing police policy sends a dangerous message. Handing a big win to people who sing songs about how racist the police are legitimizes that contention.

While many people of all political stripes acknowledge and address growing concerns about police violence towards minorities, succumbing to demands is not a sound policy. That’s especially so when the city has already reduced penalties for many of the quality-of-life or “broken windows” crimes BLM is protesting. How far will de Blasio go to foster the perception that progressive protesters can persuade him?

Giuliani and Bloomberg left de Blasio with a city that, unlike many others such as Chicago, is not suffering from a crisis of violent crime. This didn’t happen by accident. It is the direct result of policing policies that have influenced departments all over the country. It is a result of practices that work. For the city to now begin rejecting police policies that have kept millions safe is a terrible idea that should give Gotham’s voters pause next year.

Police violence is a serious and complicated issue. It deserves full attention, perhaps even protest. But decisions about how to fight crime must never result from or appear to result from frustration and anger. The mayor, who has a history of angering his police force to the point where they have asked him not to attend police funerals, should know better. The timing of this announcement is a smack in the face of the NYPD and a wink and a nod at their fiercest detractors.

Bratton is moving on to a lucrative new job. De Blasio may have calmed some of his critics in the black community. But tens of thousands of New York police officers must watch as those who call them racist and corrupt celebrate the fulfillment of one of their central demands. Out of simple courtesy to those officers and the millions they risk their lives to protect, de Blasio should have waited to have Bratton’s resignation announced. But he didn’t. Surely, today anti-police activists in New York City are wondering: what demand can we have met next?

What Police Say About Our Public Safety Crisis,"Black lives matter. Blue lives matter. These phrases are fixtures on the news and social media feeds right now as America reels from violence and tense interactions between the public servants sworn to protect people and the communities themselves. Most recently, the Washington Post reports Baltimore police say they shot 23-year-old Korryn Gaines after she brandished a shotgun and shot at them while holding her five-year-old son.

Police should be able to assess the levels of risk present in a situation and react appropriately and fairly, and the public should trust the judgement of law enforcement professionals and not have reasons to fear for their lives at simple traffic stops. Relations have broken down. The public fears the police and the police fear the people.

Threat assessment and management is an evolving field, and has to race to keep up with the changing needs of our instant society. An important goal of policing should be safety, for both the officer and for the community. In an ideal world, officers don’t make mistakes, and citizens don’t commit crimes. That’s not the reality we’re living in, so the goal shifts to minimizing dangerous mistakes and purposeful acts aimed at injuring others.

This is difficult enough in the course of normal policing, but it is even more treacherous when mental illnesses and developmental disabilities enter tense situations, as when a Miami police officer accidentally shot a caregiver for an autistic man, thinking the latter posed a threat because he wouldn’t obey police commands. Police are expected to know, with a zero-sum margin of error, if the non-compliance of the person in front of them is due to criminal intentions or a disability.

The Boundaries of Two-Way Violence

Violent interactions between the police and citizens aren’t rare in the United States. In 2010, police killed or injured 55,400 people. One in 30 injuries for people of any age that led to an emergency room visit or hospital stay were caused by the police. If you fear being shot because of the prevalence of guns, realize that 1 in 13 people killed by a firearm are killed by the police, and 1 in 11 of those police have killed were completely unarmed.

Enforcing the law is difficult, but police are not juries and executioners. Are all of these injuries and deaths justified, the police merely protecting themselves and others, with reasonable force? In the same year, 67,000 police officers were assaulted. Seventy-four percent of people police killed were either in the process of an unarmed attack on an officer, or pointing a gun at, or shooting an officer.

Beyond these numbers are valid concerns about police militarization and aggression. Dallas brought us a drone bomb used to kill a shooter on U.S. soil. Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law who studies robotics and cyber law, believes this is novel: “As far as I know, this is a first time that they’ve used a robot to intentionally kill someone.” The Pentagon operates a program to supply weapons and vehicles to police and other law enforcement agencies that were previously limited to our military. NPR has reported that nearly 500 robots, capable of carrying bombs like the Dallas one, have been distributed since 2006.

When discussing how much force is acceptable, and when the police can use lethal force, two court cases need to be considered. In 1985, with Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court addressed when lethal force was appropriate to use with a fleeing suspect, hinging on whether the suspect was trying to seriously harm someone. Graham v. Connor, decided by the Supreme Court four years later in 1989, further clarified that the circumstances warranting lethal force by the police need to be carefully examined to prevent misuse, including language from an earlier case about “whether the force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain and restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.” Discussions about ethics and police force are not new, and the increase in technology opens new avenues for potential misuse of police power.

What the Police Are Saying about Social Chaos

Dallas Police Chief David Brown believes the root of many of these issues is that we expect the police to be too many things: “We’re asking cops to do too much in this country. We are. We just ask of us to do too much. Every societal failure, we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental-health funding. Let the cop handle it. Not enough drug-addiction funding. Let’s give it to the cops. Here in Dallas, we got a loose-dog problem. Let’s have the cops chase loose dogs. Schools fail, give it to the cops. Seventy percent of the African American community is being raised by single women. Let’s give it to the cops to solve that as well. That’s too much to ask. Policing was never meant to solve all those problems, and I just ask for other parts of our democracy, along with the free press, to help us.”

He’s not alone. Talking to officers who are currently serving or have served in settings across the nation, a deep problem becomes clear. Due to regulations on speaking to the press, these law enforcement officers agreed to speak as long as they remain anonymous.

Bob, who worked in corrections, notes that, “The majority of the problems come with people either in serious crisis, or are self-medicating, or are off their meds. At that point all you can really do is wrap them up and bring them to somebody that can help. More often than not it will be the police [rather than the medical community]. There’s something going wrong and the police are called. They’re the first ones there.”

The goal of policing isn’t to have incidents that end up on the news. Rather, “Our credo is basically, ‘Let’s keep it boring.’ An exciting day is rare, and not a good day.”

Frank, a retired homicide detective turned pastor and chaplain, talked about officers’ training for dealing with mental illnesses and developmental concerns like autism: “I think many departments do provide a fair amount of training on that; especially departments accredited by CALEA. But, even with training, it is a challenging thing to deal with for LEOs [law enforcement officers]. Just as most of our culture is trying to get up to speed with autism, so too police departments…Media could be helpful by encouraging a wait and see attitude for all the facts to come regarding some of these very critical incidents. Our social media age makes that difficult with such rapid and highly emotional responses without knowing the totality of the circumstances.”

We Need More Mental Health Resources

Lynn Mittelstadt, a nurse educator who has worked in behavioral community health, has seen this issue from the other side. “Police officers come in contact with people when they are in crisis. And people don’t know who to contact. Police officers should be trained to distinguish between what is a criminal act and what is a mental health crisis. Having a mental health crisis is not a criminal act.”

Like Rod Dreher has noted, she also says people often end up dealing with the police instead of medical professionals, when the latter would often be more appropriate.

“Even with the mental health parity that was passed, coverage on insurance plans can differ between medical care and mental health care,” Mittelstadt said. “Access is scant, there are few mental health providers. The need far exceeds demand. And many people bring up mental health concerns with their pcp [primary care provider], who may not recognize the signs and symptoms of a mental illness. Underserved and rural populations have even less access to care.”

The Affordable Care Act’s expansion of mental health care access and increased talk about mental illness hasn’t changed that it’s still hard to access care. There’s stigma, a lack of options, and misunderstandings about what mental health actually is. Without a grasp of that, police, whose job it is to care for people in crisis, are fighting a losing battle.

Mittelstadt offers advice on dealing with people in crisis: “Really the key is to be willing to listen to what the other person is saying, and to be willing to stay with them during crisis. Just saying, ‘I am here, and I will stay with you, we will do this together. You are not alone.’ Those are powerful words that are backed up with actions.”

No law-abiding person should fear police interactions, and no police officers should fear for their lives just because they’re doing their job. The culture of fear and mistrust makes everyone less safe, less able to access help, and creates an us-versus-them mentality between communities and police.

Police aren’t outsiders, they’re people. When we single out groups as mattering less or more, we forget that we should be standing together, working to improve the safety and lives of us all. This issue will not go away, and there are important and difficult ethical questions that need to be answered sooner rather than later. Our population needs police that protect us, not kill us, and our police need to be able to safely enforce laws. Instead of using police actions to generate income, let them do their actual jobs.

CJ Ciaramella On Police Reform And Politics Surrounding Local Crime,"CJ Ciaramella, criminal justice reporter at Reason Magazine, discussed his latest reporting on national and local crime on today’s Federalist Radio, including the politics and policing in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.

“What [protesters] say they’re asking for is police accountability, for there to be more mechanisms for police to be held accountable,” he said. “Part of the problem with making this a national debate about police reform is that every police agency is a local agency and all criminal justice really starts at the local level.”

The tension between local-level conflicts and national-level solutions has been a major part of the rise in anti-police attitudes. “That’s where the rubber meets the road– at the very local level. Starting with the district attorneys. Staring with the police chiefs,” Ciaramella said. “You’re starting to see a big uptick in challenges in competitive campaigns for DA’s and state attorneys.”

Rotherham Authorities Still Ignoring Massive Child Sex Ring,"A new investigation by the Daily Express has found that the massive Rotherham child sex exploitation ring whose discovery rocked England two years ago is not only still in operation, but is as strong as ever. Reports from social workers, police, residents, and abuse victims all said the same thing: It’s still happening on an “industrial scale.”

In 2014, an independent inquiry led by Alexis Jay, a former senior social worker, found that men of Pakistani origin had groomed at least 1,400 young girls for sexual exploitation over the previous 16 years. These girls, as young as 12, were variously raped, abducted, tortured, and forced into prostitution. Keep in mind, this happened—and is still happening—in the heart of England, not some far-flung banana republic.

The report, known as the Jay Report, found “blatant” failure by city officials and police who didn’t prosecute the well-known and well-documented crime ring out of fear of being accused of racism. So they hushed it up, ignored it, and blamed the victims themselves.

It now appears that, two years and millions of pounds later, little has been done to eradicate the predatory operation. Despite a follow-up report published earlier this year claiming that the sexual exploitation was being addressed “adequately” and that previous failures were “isolated” events, people the Daily Express interviewed paint a very different picture.

Sex Trafficking Rings Across England

A former social worker who works with the victims said there has been a slight improvement in the city but that the scale of the sexual exploitation is still on an “industrial” level. A lawyer who has represented dozens of the young girls involved added that there are now half a dozen “splinter groups” in the town grooming under-aged girls.

This same lawyer is convinced that similar abuse is going on in towns across England, and that local police aren’t taking parents seriously, just they didn’t in Rotherham for years. This is corroborated by reports that authorities have arrested or prosecuted men, mainly of Pakistani origin, operating similar sex rings in 11 towns in England.

This new development raises a number of concerns, one of which is whether authorities continue their inaction from fear of being accused of racism for going after these groups of predominately Pakistani men. One victim who was interviewed by the Daily Express said she knew several other girls who had gone to the police and were told they were being racist.

More Important: Ending Rape or Ending Whining?

It wouldn’t be surprising if this fear were still motivating officials. In 2015, the group British Muslim Youth called on Muslims in Rotherham to cut ties with the police because, they claimed, all Muslims were being painted with the same brush. The Muslim community would “boycott” Muslims who didn’t join with them. According to the BMY, Islamaphobia had risen to “unprecedented levels” after the Jay report was published in 2014, and Muslims were being “demonized.”

It’s entirely possible that Muslims in general took some unfair heat after a scandal like this. But that doesn’t mean the government and police don’t have a solemn responsibility to speak plainly about and take seriously allegations of criminal activity, regardless of the suspects’ profile.

This line of reasoning always creeps up when criticism of Muslims or Islam arises. Try to talk about the dangers of Islamism and its clear link to terrorism, or the consequences of mass Muslim immigration, and one is liable to be branded a bigot and told one’s making the problem worse by encouraging a backlash against the Muslim community.

The London Times, which first broke the story of one of the victims and her abusers in 2013, was subsequently accused of being racist because it implicated Pakistani men in the scandal. This confirmed the fears of some Rotherham officials that many would not welcome prosecutions and arrests of Pakistanis. These kinds of overreactions from Muslim activists are exactly what scares police and government officials, discouraging them from investigating and prosecuting crimes committed by their Muslim immigrant population.

This Is a Widespread Problem

It isn’t just happening in Britain. The same phenomenon can be seen across the European continent. German officials repeatedly tried to cover up the mass sexual assaults that occurred on New Year’s Eve in cities across the country. First, they tried to keep what had happened out of the news, then insisted it had nothing to do with migrants or men from Muslim-majority countries. When it finally came out that the attackers were, in fact, predominately from the Middle East and North Africa, German officials tried to downplay the extent of the attacks. To the German government’s chagrin, news broke just last month that there were many more assaults than previously thought—more than 1,200 victims and more than 2,000 attackers.

We can get an insight into the motivations behind these kinds of official cover-ups by looking at a less well-known example. In January, a left-wing German politician was raped in a playground by three men speaking Arabic or Farsi. When she reported the crime to the police, she lied and said the men were speaking German. Twelve hours later she went back and told the truth, claiming she hadn’t wanted to create “more hatred against migrants in Germany.”

In all these cases, the truth didn’t conform with the official narrative about Muslim immigration: that everything’s going swimmingly. In reality, the unwillingness of the government, politicians, and police to confront crime committed by the Muslim immigrant population is a sign that Europe has a deep and troubling integration crisis on its hands. Europe can’t integrate immigrants if it doesn’t hold them to the same standards as the native European population.

Equality Under the Law Matters

There are ominous signs this failure of integration is being transferred to the younger generation of immigrants. In the Rotherham case, it appears that it’s no longer just older Pakistani men who are targeting these young girls. It’s now also the girls’ peers.

If European law enforcement agencies give immigrants from Muslim countries special treatment, the consequences on all fronts will only be harmful. It will fuel far-right groups, allow crime to go unchecked, and create more strife between Muslims and non-Muslims. It also infantilizes Muslim communities by treating them as too fragile to be held to the social and legal expectations of their new home.

This failure of integration has been going on for decades and is now reaching a fevered pitch. Europe sowed these seeds of discord long ago and now it’s seeing the fruits. Many immigrants and their families have done just fine in Europe. But as we’re seeing almost weekly, many have not.

Rotherham is a particular disgrace because it shows that once again multiculturalism trumps everything, including the safety of young girls. The shocking revelations about Rotherham two years ago should have resulted in a final repudiation of European political correctness. Sadly, it didn’t. And some of England’s most vulnerable residents are paying the price.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/10/report-british-authorities-still-ignoring-massive-pakistani-led-child-sex-ring/,2016-08-10
How We Can Make Milwaukee’s Race Riots The Last,"Milwaukee had a rough weekend. After a controversial police shooting, rioters burned businesses, threw rocks at police, and damaged multiple police cars. It’s a hot conclusion to a hot summer, and few have felt the heat like America’s police officers.

After July’s tragic beginning, many of us were quietly relieved when the violence tapered off, allowing the news cycle to turn to political conventions and the Olympic Games. Clearly, though, it’s no time to relax. Winter is coming, but maybe not quickly enough.

The New Race Riots

As this weekend clearly showed, America’s cities are still roiling with discontent. In Chicago, violent crime is spinning out of control. Last week the U.S. Department of Justice released a lengthy report on Baltimore’s Police Department with disturbing allegations of people being tased for no real reason, arrested just for loitering on sidewalks, or beaten even when they were already restrained and under officers’ control. Now we have a riot significant enough to activate the National Guard. When Barack Obama first took office in 2008, did any of us anticipate that his administration would end with widespread race riots?

Here’s a shred of comfort: major riots tend to be a summer thing. Cold weather has a chilling effect on everything, including racial tension. Thus far, America’s major riots have always taken place between April and August (although we should note that unusually warm weather is forecast for this September).

There may still be time to head off violence on a level of Watts, Rodney King, or the Holy Week uprisings of 1968. Any viable solution to the problem, however, must involve greater accountability on everyone’s part. Stop finger-pointing. Start cleaning your own house.

First, The Police

There’s no way to know for sure, but I bet the incredible grace with which Dallas Police Chief David Brown handled his city’s policing crisis has saved lives. He spoke warmly of the courage and commitment of his officers. He unashamedly asked for the nation’s prayers. But he also made clear that he understands why so many poor, black kids grow up mistrusting the police, and that he’s personally committed to helping rebuild trust. Dallas has, in fact, been working to improve community relations, especially with black residents.

Brown’s masterstroke was inviting Black Lives Matter protesters to put in an application and come work for him. He’d love to put them back into their own neighborhoods as trained and salaried problem-solvers. We could use a lot more sane and compassionate people like Brown.

Policing is difficult and dangerous work. Sometimes our officers are judged too harshly. Sometimes we expect too much of them. The police are at the front lines of most public safety initiatives, and are more trusted than any state actor except the military. That’s both a blessing and a curse.

We can respect the police, though, without writing them a blank check. Turning a blind eye to police misconduct isn’t any kind of favor, either to good police officers or to citizens who feel threatened by the police.

The DOJ’s report on Baltimore leaves a strong impression that the department’s police officers are undertrained and overwhelmed, and discipline has lapsed as a result. It describes officers shooting at retreating cars (which endangers the public and rarely disables the suspect) and chasing down residents merely on the suspicion that they might be armed (which, needless to say, is not itself illegal). They tase suspects who are already restrained in an effort to make them more cooperative. They ignore departmental guidelines for dealing with teenagers and the mentally ill.

It seems pretty clear that black citizens of Baltimore are disproportionately likely to suffer the consequences of these mistakes. Although they plausibly aren’t (in most cases) manifestations of overt racism, they’re the sort of abuses that undermine trust and make neighborhoods more dangerous for officers and residents alike. We shouldn’t try to paper over these problems. The BPD needs to do better, and so do many other departments around the country.

Next, Local Government

The DOJ concluded that Baltimore’s policing issues “result from a longstanding practice of overly aggressive street enforcement with deficient oversight and policy guidance.” That seems quite plausible, and it means we shouldn’t lay all the blame on the beleaguered beat cop.

We should note, as well, that Baltimore has languished under corrupt and incompetent Democratic governance for decades, which explains a lot about its training and oversight problems. Like Chicago, Baltimore can’t plausibly complain its bad reputation is attributable to Obama’s inflammatory rhetoric about racial bias in policing. The department has long been infamous for criminal misconduct, kickback scandals, and harassing citizens. There are many good officers who don’t want things to be this way. It’s hard to change things, though, when the city’s government is riddled with similar problems.

There are lots of ways for a city to neglect its poorer citizens. Quite often, the officers are just the hapless enforcers who get the blame for everyone else’s failings. For instance, many cash-strapped cities pressure police to issue scores of fines and citations to collect revenue. Turning cops into low-level tax collectors is a great way to destroy community relations, but the officers themselves may have little choice if they want a paycheck.

On other occasions, cities may simply prioritize the demands of wealthier and more established citizens, leaving poorer neighborhoods underserved. When inexperienced officers are coping with unmanageable crime control problems, they may just decide the Constitution is a luxury they can’t afford.

In the wake of the Baltimore report, some have stepped up to defend stop-and-frisk and broken-window policing, which in some circumstances has shown real success in deterring crime. Insofar as we use these strategies, we need to note this important caveat: Aggressive policing must be done in such a way as to assure local residents that it serves their interests. That will only happen with adequate oversight provisions, and a governmental structure that shows concern for neighborhood order instead of lining its own pockets.

Your Turn, Black Lives Matter

Let’s start here: Riots don’t fix anything. They ruin the lives of innocent people, undermine trust, and exacerbate tensions with law enforcement. We should all resist the urge to call rioters “protesters” and to justify lawlessness on the grounds that “people are upset.” This is America. We can express our anger without resorting to arson.

This is America. We can express our anger without resorting to arson.

Next, let’s talk about police safety. Black Lives Matter doesn’t sanction the murder of police officers, and last month’s cop killers seem to have been acting independently. Black Lives Matter put up a public statement that clarified, somewhere in the middle of the third paragraph, that it didn’t condone the violence. That’s pretty representative of the organization’s response. It’s something, but it would be awfully nice to see more.

It’s not fair to blame whole groups of people for the atrocities of an isolated few. Nonetheless, the reality is that Black Lives Matter protests are now legitimately dangerous for police officers, and they go anyway, because it’s their job to keep protesters safe. This is the life of a police officer.

Black Lives Matter could massively increase its credibility by showing they too can show concern for people outside their own ranks. A few small gestures could go a long way. How about putting up a “Blue Lives Matter” on the website? Why not distribute a list of tips for protestors: “Keeping Rallies Peaceful”? Urge participants to see it as their responsibility to ensure that everyone present is safe, including law enforcement.

Clearly, this wouldn’t be popular with all BLM participants. A brief foray into social media will demonstrate that many activists feel serious malice towards the police. In the end, though, these are the decisions that distinguish mature social movements from the more juvenile. Mature movements can restrain negative emotions for the sake of promoting lasting change.

Many Americans still seem to be deciding whether BLM represents a serious social movement or just one more excuse for unruly youngsters to wreak havoc. Every time a protest devolves into violence and vandalism (as happened in Milwaukee this weekend), a few more people are tipped into the latter view. Rein it in, Black Lives Matter. Many desperate people are counting on you.

That Means You, the Reader

I’m not a big believer in collective guilt. I’m not going to ask you to wander into your local coffee shop and Start A Conversation About Race. I won’t demand that you search your subconscious for some hitherto-unsurfaced bigotry that needs addressing.

Here’s what I would ask. Get beyond the impulse to defend either protestors or police at all costs. Don’t hit “share” every time you encounter a piece of evidence that The Other Guy (the one who doesn’t have your sympathies) is the real problem. Try to keep in mind that riots are a lose-lose sort of event, while genuine law and order is good for just about everybody.

Support good cops, but also keep an eye out for activists who seem to be making a thoughtful effort to promote peaceful change. Don’t apologize for corrupt officials, bullying officers, or violent vandals. Let’s have a nation with more David Browns and fewer Rahm Emanuels. That should be common ground we can all support.

A Former Cop Takes On ‘The War On Cops’,"When news of the Milwaukee police shooting and the ensuing riots broke earlier this month, it’s safe to say I watched the news more intently than most. I’m a former beat cop who worked the some of the worst neighborhoods in a large Midwestern city. If America’s having an ongoing debate about the police response to inner city crime, well, it’s a subject where I have a lot of first-hand knowledge.

Aside from a few years as cop, I have worked in law enforcement my whole adult life, in one way or another. In the Army, instead of counterintelligence, I was accidentally assigned to a criminal investigation team. (It turns out that in the Army both are abbreviated “CI.”) That investigation involved looking into a new bunch of suspected terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay. I worked with those agents for 10 years as a criminal intelligence analyst. I have been a criminal intelligence analyst since then, and I provide training for criminal investigators today.

I am also a “law and order” kind of guy, and while I agree that government is wasteful and often uses force capriciously, I also believe police need a few armored vehicles and SWAT teams. But I see the abuses and the errors, and I know how painful police mistakes are to the fabric of our nation.

But when I first started to tackle Heather Mac Donald’s latest book, which at 233 pages shouldn’t require a running start, I was too busy rolling my eyes over the title. The War on Cops:How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe seems like hyperbole at a time when nuance and thoughtfulness is desperately needed in the debate over criminal justice reform and allegations of police brutality. I was worried this was going to be the same kind of breathlessness, only from the police point of view. We’ve already had enough mania resulting from Black Lives Matter rhetoric.

Not Hyperbole

The original “Ferguson Effect” was supposed to be attacks on police everywhere, and for months that never happened. Instances of police being killed were actually dropping. But then Baltimore protests over the death of Freddy Grey turned into rioting; then Baton Rouge, Dallas, Minneapolis, and now Milwaukee. I began to realize this wasn’t hyperbole.

Mac Donald’s book starts with Ferguson. The Ferguson incident brought the issues of police racism and brutality to the forefront, and gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. It is, unquestionably, the most divisive environment American law enforcement has seen since the Rodney King incident in California in 1991. The current environment may be worse, as the Rodney King issue was often framed as a California problem. The riots after the police officers were acquitted in the King case were severe, but they were limited to Los Angeles. Now, 25 years later, every city seems to be capable of bursting into flames as soon as a police officer fires a weapon.

We must remember, though, that Ferguson is a massively important milestone in criminal justice reform, but not for the reasons that most people understand. Ferguson was, and continues to be, mostly ignorant myth and deliberate deception. Every credible assessment of the shooting that prompted the rioting found it was justified.

That’s not to say that the incident shouldn’t prompt some soul-searching from law enforcement. The Justice Department review of the Ferguson Police Department found a disturbing trend: not of random executions of unarmed teenagers, but of a systematic fleecing of the people of Ferguson by their own police department. Policing was used by the city’s political leadership as an important source of revenue generation. Unsurprisingly, a reflexively liberal media did not seize upon political corruption and excessive taxation as important contributors to the violence and tensions between police and poor urban communities.

Addressing Reality

This is an important theme that runs though Mac Donald’s book. There are major issues within American policing. We are in desperate need of significant reforms of our criminal justice system. But, as Mac Donalds’s book shows with clear prose, credible data, and statistical analysis, the problems are often not what we see reported in in traditional news media. We are not having a useful debate about policing, because we are talking about the wrong things, and in many cases, we are debating the finer points of completely imaginary environments.

Mac Donald’s data helps cut through the haze of poorly written headlines, social media outrage, and sensationalized cable news coverage. The effect of this, however, is a bit like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is distressing to see that much of what passes for debate and discussion about criminal justice reform, police brutality, and the racism of our criminal justice system is simply not addressing reality.

Once she establishes the wrongness of the initial Michael Brown “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative, andshe demonstrates how the U.S. attorney general and President Obama callously exploited it. This helped set the stage for Baltimore.

Since the publication of The War on Cops, prosecution of the police officers accused of being either directly involved or potentially negligent in the death of Freddy Grey have collapsed. Mac Donald discusses the Baltimore riots at length, and notes especially the contrived, almost scripted nature of how the riots played out.

City leadership’s orders to essentially let the riots go on reinforce this point. It seems that any opportunity to let a city burn is abated by a news media that cheerfully parrots Black Lives Matter talking points, while politicians who have been capitalizing on the plight of African Americans gravely condemn the actions of police they command before the crime scene has even been processed.

The Virulent Strain of Libertarianism

Part two of Mac Donald’s book, subtitled “Handcuffing the Cops,” builds on the theme that much of what we think we understand about policing and the debate about criminal justice reform is based on so few facts that we are missing the point completely. She begins a litany of other criminal justice issues, refutes the conventional (or at least popular) wisdom, and manages to get in solid blows against narratives of both social justice warriors and the more anti-cop libertarians.

Maybe the social justice warriors are a lost cause, but I hope libertarians are at least receptive to some of what Mac Donald has to say. I know most libertarians don’t think of themselves as anti-cop. Some are very thoughtful about the massive power we give flawed people and systems, which I understand and appreciate a great deal.

But libertarians also need to be cautious about encouraging a strain that hates the concept of any authority, law, or police. Libertarians have some of the best ideas about criminal justice reform out there and are right to worry about the excess militarization of police. But at times they seem a bit too ambivalent about the reality that we will always need people with guns on patrol.

As for the Justice Department’s new rules regarding citizen complaints against the police, Mac Donald argues they are mostly a power grab. Complaints and lawsuits about stop and frisk in New York City, Mac Donald argues, have only left people in the poorest, most dangerous neighborhoods more at risk as police are further restricted from being proactive.

A Criminal Disconnect

Part three lays out a series of anecdotes, chiefly designed to refute sociologist and TED-talker Alice Goffman’s book, On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City. Part three is subtitled “The Truth about Crime,” and I expected more data here. This section, while a scathing retort to Goffman’s book, seems out of place for anyone, like myself, who had never heard of Goffman or her book. Goffman, Mac Donald claims, is endemic of a white, liberal class of sociologists who place blame for crime entirely on police and the courts.

I have not read Goffman’s book, so I cannot evaluate the strength or weakness of her research or arguments. It is worth noting that Goffman has been accused of getting so close to the subjects of her study in criminal justice that, among other things, she may have driven the getaway car in a murder plot.

I can certainly vouch for a serious disconnect between the realities of crime and the world of some criminologists and sociologists. There is a trend of empathetic, well-meaning people who can’t seem to remember the pain, danger, and fear criminals cause once they have met some of those criminals and found out criminals have experienced pain, danger, and fear themselves. They mistake empathy for tolerance, and slide into weakness.

There is a simple antidote for this: Talk to victims and survivors of crime. Since the vast majority of victims never turn to violence, theft, or drugs, I don’t find pain and hardship quite the excuse that many sympathizers with criminals do.

The Marijuana Myth

Part four focuses on prisons, and some of the misconceptions about “mass incarceration” and the perceived benefits of decriminalization of some, or all, illegal drugs. I found this section very interesting, as I do not normally read or think much about the penal system. The biggest revelation in this section, which is hard to refute thanks to the data, is the fantasy that there are significant numbers of people in jail simply because of drug possession, especially marijuana possession.

We must not believe our prisons will empty and the criminal underclass will be liberated from the tyranny of the police if we just decriminalize marijuana.

In reality, most people in prison are there for violence. Certainly, some of that violence is associated with drug trafficking, which some will say is an argument for de-criminalization. Some of that violence is committed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, which some will say is an argument for treatment-based responses. But we must not believe our prisons will empty and the criminal underclass will be liberated from the tyranny of the police if we just decriminalize marijuana.

Mac Donald notes clearly this would have a minor, possibly negligible impact on our prisons. We can academically debate the merits of decriminalization of marijuana. I believe we should be experimenting with decriminalization and legalization, and I am happy to see various programs being tried. In my experience in law enforcement, I never had to fight a guy who had been smoking marijuana, but I had to fight a lot of people who had been drinking. Maybe that’s not a scientific survey, but I’m open to the argument that marijuana could be part of an orderly society.

That being said, I would like to send an additional 100,000 cops into the streets to smash heroin, meth, and cocaine dealers. If that didn’t work, I’d send another 100,000. I don’t have any sympathy or mercy for dealing hard drugs.

The Cycle Repeats Itself

If nothing else, Mac Donald’s book is a good reminder that we need more data in our debates about criminal justice reform. We need more evidence, and more rational thought. Black Lives Matter activists scream that young, black men are being executed in the streets, but this just is not true. This irrationality is getting worse, not better, and time is making this hysteria more prevalent, not less.

These demonstrably false impressions feed fear and irrational actions that put people in danger.

The recent rioting in Milwaukee has turned this into a farce after a black police officer killed an armed black man. It seems no pretense or distortion is needed to justify a riot anymore. There’s no need to even concoct the fantasy of Mike Brown surrendering and then being executed for no reason by a racist white cop.

The tragedy is that these demonstrably false impressions feed fear and irrational actions that put people in danger. Black Americans have been told that police execute them for no reason, so of course they run from and fight with police. Running and fighting only increases the chances for violence, and the cycle repeats itself.

The unavoidable reality is this: The police are the only part of the government that is authorized to kill Americans on the spot, and make the decision to kill in an instant. This is not true of Special Forces, the CIA, the NSA, NASA, Congress, the president, the IRS, the Department of the Interior, Exterior, or somewhere in between.

They are also the people called to respond to every single problem in poor, mostly minority communities. Noise complaint? Cops. Kids hanging out on the corner? Cops. Someone is hungry or drunk? Cops. Your kids won’t obey you? Cops. Your cousin is suicidal? Cops. Your neighbor is schizophrenic? Cops. Your landlord is a jerk? Cops. After all the rhetoric and nonsense, poor, urban neighborhoods call for police services more than anywhere else.

I don’t know if this is evidence that the Black Lives Matter movement is totally disconnected from normal urban culture, or if this is evidence of an astounding lack of self-awareness. Remember that the defining quality of the role of police, versus all other social and governmental support, is that they are expected to be obeyed or they can, will, and often are required to use force. Police are government power in its plainest form.

This is a concept called “The law of the instrument,” coined by Abraham Maslow to describe the over-reliance on familiar tools. “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” Maslow said. For our social decline in the inner city, all we have is police, and we are amazed that everyone has started to look like a criminal to them.

The First Amendment Is A Double-Edged Sword For Kaepernick,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick launched a thousand hot takes recently in refusing to stand during the national anthem at a NFL preseason game. Some players supported him, others criticized the stunt. Sports writers delved into politics while political writers talked sports. Even the president put in his two cents.

This past weekend, the protest spread to professional soccer as U.S. Women’s National Team player Megan Rapinoe inexplicably exchanged the Flag Code for the Book of Common Prayer and decided she could “stand or kneel” during the anthem at a Seattle Reign game. She knelt.

The furor over Kaepernick has gotten Americans talking about free speech and the First Amendment. In that, at least, something good has been accomplished. The discussion breaks down into several overlapping categories. First: does the First Amendment protect Kaepernick’s protest? Almost everyone agrees that it does, but that does not mean as much as you might think. The First Amendment protects people from being punished by the government for their speech. In that, Kaepernick and Rapinoe are secure.

Various Internet law “experts” have debated even this fairly obvious bit of law. Consider this tweet (since deleted) by the American Family Association:

The AFA is right about one thing: the Flag Code exists. You may have learned about it in scouting or elementary school. It is a collection of rules about how people are supposed to treat the American flag. It is detailed and rigorous, but carries as much legal weight as Amy Vanderbilt’s etiquette books.

Even if the language of the law was not clearly a suggestion (“should,” rather than “must” or “shall”), courts have long decided that laws like the one the AFA imagines exists violate the First Amendment and are void (see, for example, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette). Just as no one will throw you in jail for using the wrong fork, no one will throw you in jail for showing disrespect to the American flag.

Clearly, Kaepernick and Rapinoe won’t be sent to Guantanamo Bay for their lack of patriotic fervor. But can their employers punish them? This is a trickier issue. The NFL, in particular, has been known to fine players for all sorts of things that government would consider protected speech.

The NFL’s statement was brief: “Players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the National Anthem.” The 49ers were equally unwilling to take sides, saying they “recognize the right of an individual to choose to participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.” As yet, the NWSL and Seattle Reign have not commented on Rapinoe’s protest.

Free Speech for Some, Miniature American Flags for Others

The government may not punish them for speaking out, and their employers have declined to do so. But what about the people? In this, we are all free to decide. As usual, some consider being unpatriotic the highest form of patriotism. Even among those who love the flag, the anthem, and the republic for which they stand, some have jumped to Kaepernick’s defense. You may even have seen someone drag out that old line attributed to Voltaire (actually written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall): “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”

Defending the right to unpopular speech, if not the speech itself, is the heart of free speech as a societal value. The Constitution says only the government will not punish people for their speech, but defending free expression is not required by law. When we do that, we do it because the marketplace of ideas has become a core part of the concept of democracy.

Tolerating differences of opinion has always been a part of the American character. This democratic spirit is what breathes life into the Constitution’s words. If we only had the words of the First Amendment without the societal value that goes along with them, courts would have long ago found a way to brush the words aside. Our freedoms in law are constantly reinforced by the idea, independent of the written law, that this is a free country.

A tradition of tolerance, though, does not require us to accept all behavior as equal, nor does it require us to agree with the speech we believe should be protected. Plenty of people have said they will boycott 49ers games and burn their Kaepernick jerseys. That is their free speech. Others will buy Kaepernick’s jersey in record numbers. That, too, is free speech (and a handy illustration of why, no matter which side they take, the NFL always wins).

When the Government Boycotts You

Boycotts get trickier when the people doing the boycotting are government employees. The idea has become more common lately that if government employees find some law objectionable, they may choose not to enforce it. Former Pennsylvania Attorney General (and current convicted felon) Kathleen Kane declared in 2013 that she would not defend her state’s marriage statute from constitutional challenge, despite that being the one of the main duties of her job. In 2015, Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, took the opposite side of that argument, refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite the law of the land requiring that she do so.

In both instances, these state workers took their right to free speech and turned it into a new, imagined right: the right not to do your job (and still get paid). In the continuing Kaepernick drama, the Santa Clara Police Officers’ Association seemingly joined the side of the government boycotters. The consequences here are even more dramatic; the police cannot choose whom to protect based on their speech. On closer inspection, though, the SCPOA’s exact position is more complicated than Kane’s or Davis’s.

As local reporter Ian Cull explained on Friday, the union issued a statement stating that its officers might stop working at 49ers home games because of their disagreement with Kaepernick. Given that the 49ers’ home stadium is in Santa Clara, it sounds like the police are threatening to withdraw their protection from the arena, leaving it a stinking den of lawlessness. This is not the case.

In reading the full letter from the SCPOA to the Niners, it becomes clear that Calvin Coolidge can rest easy: the police are not on strike. They never were deployed at the stadium to begin with. Instead, the 49ers typically employ off-duty police officers to work as security guards when the team has a home game. Many of these officers are Santa Clara police officers and members of the SCPOA.

In that case, one might say that the Santa Clara officers are doing what rule-of-law advocates demanded of Kane and Davis all along: if you disagree with the job you’re hired to do, you should quit. These police officers are working a second job for an employer with whom they suddenly have reason to disagree. As a result, they expressed their disagreement through their union, and threatened to quit if the disagreement is not resolved. This is the free market at work, isn’t it?

It is, but it is not a simple as all that. Police unions, like all government employee unions, occupy a different place in American life than their private-sector brethren. If you disagree with something about the carpenters’ union, you can hire non-union carpenters—or, if you have a preference for union workers, you can hire only union carpenters. The market affords us that choice. No one is forced to join a union, and no one is forced to hire union (or non-union) workers. That same First Amendment guarantees the freedom to associate (or not associate) as we choose.

The same is not true with government worker unions. The nature of government is that there is only one of them at each level. Wherever you live, there is one municipal government for that place, one state government, and one federal government. You can move from place to place, but wherever you land, there is only one choice. When the government workers are unionized, they also have a monopoly, one the citizenry cannot avoid.

The idea that they have a right to do their job without criticism—that anyone has such a right—is ludicrous.

Looking at the SCPOA’s letter from this point of view, the closing paragraph seems more menacing: “The men and women of the Santa Clara Police Officers Association are sworn to protect the rights of ALL people in the United States, a duty we take very seriously. Our members, however, have the right to do their job in an environment free of unjustified and insulting attacks from employees of your organization.”

As far as the members’ second job at the stadium goes, this is true. But phrased as an absolute right, it makes the average citizen question the union’s commitment to non-discriminatory policing. Citizens should respect the police, who put their lives on the line to maintain order and safety in our communities. But the idea that they have a right to do their job without criticism—that anyone has such a right—is ludicrous.

Police officers have every right to disagree with Kaepernick’s statements and actions. Kaepernick, for his part, has the same right to disagree with the police. And while SCPOA members have the right to quit their second jobs as private security for the 49ers, their union should be careful about establishing a precedent that they have the right to work free of criticism. If they want to quit, they should quit, and let the 49ers hire new security guards. But they, and we, should also remember that the First Amendment runs both ways.

Why Is The NFL Enabling Seahawks Anthem Boycotters?,"As we enter the first weekend of the NFL season, the Internet is abuzz with claims that the Seattle Seahawks are planning to protest the singing of the national anthem before their game on Sunday. The Broncos’ Brandon Marshall also refused to stand during the national anthem before last night’s season-opener.

These actions mirror a similar protest by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick before pre-season games over the past two weeks. Kaepernick’s protest was largely directed at police. The quarterback also chose to wear socks with pigs in police hats to practice.

On Wednesday, Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin Jr. tweeted that critics of the Seahawks plans to protest the anthem couldn’t think logically:

https://twitter.com/DougBaldwinJr/status/773677964588306432

Thursday Baldwin walked back that tweet a bit, describing a vague “demonstration of unity” before Sunday’s game.

https://twitter.com/DougBaldwinJr/status/773969821360754688

Whatever the Seahawks have planned for Sunday, the silence from the NFL over this matter has been deafening. As of this writing, the NFL has made no statement on the Seahawks plans. In response to Kaepernick’s protest, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, “I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don’t live in a perfect society. …On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL. I personally believe very strongly in that.”

NFL Puts Its Thumb on the Scale

Goodell’s statement suggests players are free to express their social or political viewpoints while in uniform on the field. But another incident this summer showed the NFL taking a much dimmer view of mixing politics and football.

After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers in July, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society. When the Cowboys wanted to send the message that police officers should not be hunted and assassinated, the NFL gave a clear answer: no.

When actor James Woods pointed out on Twitter that the NFL allowed Kaepernick’s protest but did not allow the Cowboys to honor police, Politifact found his claim “true.” They pointed to a league rule that reads: “The League will not grant permission for any club or player to wear, display, or otherwise convey messages, through helmet decals, arm bands, jersey patches, or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment, which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns.”

On the one hand, rules are rules. On the other hand, each October the NFL honors breast cancer awareness month with players decked out in pink accoutrements for what is clearly a non-football cause. Perhaps celebrating police sacrifice is more political or controversial than fighting breast cancer, but clearly the league could have made an exception. It chose not to.

The NFL Has the Power to Stop This

This leads one to wonder if any rule would allow the NFL to ban players or teams from protesting during the national anthem. Seattle players have First Amendment rights, but so do Dallas players. Besides, the primary issue isn’t one of free speech, since the First Amendment applies only to government actions, and in this instance players are employees subject to private rules they agreed to in their contracts. The latest collective bargaining agreement between the Players Association and the NFL offers some guidance here. Article 51, section 6 says the following:

Public Statements: The NFLPA and the [National Football League] Management Council agree that each will use reasonable efforts to curtail public comments by Club personnel or players which express criticism of any club, its coach, or its operation and policy, or which tend to cast discredit upon a Club, a player or any other person involved in the operation of a Club, the NFL, the Management Council, or the NFLPA.

If it chose, the NFL could use Section 6 to bar players from criticizing the policy of playing the national anthem before games. Clearly, players protesting the anthem are also protesting the league’s decision to play it, and under the agreement the NFL has a right to stop them from doing so, not only during the anthem, but also during interviews.

Whether the NFL should use its authority to ban protests during or before games is a matter of debate. Whether they have the authority to do so is not: they do. The fact remains that while they chose to exercise their contractual right to stop the Cowboys from honoring dead police officers, they have chosen not to do so for those protesting the anthem.

When People Politicize Sports

The NFL and all sports have good reason for keeping politics out of their brand. People of all political stripes can come together for sports. One could easily imagine a situation in which the Cowboys became the conservative, police-supporting team while the Seahawks represent progressive values and support protests against police.

In Europe and South America this politicization of sport happens. Famously, Spanish powerhouses Barcelona and Real Madrid have represented different political factions for decades. In South America, Boca Juniors and River Plate have a similar history. This can lead to violent confrontations and a kind of enmity rarely associated with American sports. Unitas’ conservative Colts versus Namath’s libertine Jets and Joe Frazier’s fights with Muhammad Ali had political undertones, but these are rare exceptions.

So why would the NFL stick to its guns and disallow the Cowboys’ message of support for police while it allows players to protest police by refusing to stand for the national anthem? The answer is likely that while there was some anger at the Cowboys decision, the NFL knew any action against anti-police protestors would meet a liberal media firestorm. Put simply, all the NFL cares about is money and image. Stopping the Cowboys homage didn’t affect that, yet stopping the anti-anthem antics very well might.

There is one more important point to note about the Seahawks’ players “demonstration of unity.” This Sunday is not only the first of the regular season, it is also the fifteenth anniversary of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. Sixty officers of the Port Authority of New York, New Jersey Police Department, and the New York Police Department died in the terror attack.

Kaepernick assures us wearing socks with pigs in police caps wasn’t meant to refer to all police, just as racists regularly assure us they aren’t ever talking about all black or brown people. Presumably he and the Seahawks’ players admit there are some good ones. One hopes that everyone respects the sacrifices made by men in civic uniform 15 years ago.

Of all the days of the year, September 11 should be set aside to honor those who serve and protect us, those prepared to run into falling towers to protect their fellow man. If honoring fallen police officers is too political to be part of an NFL game, then the league should rethink whether protesting police during the national anthem should be allowed. If they do allow it, they cannot hide behind the First Amendment. It will be their choice, plain and simple, and a choice we should not soon forget.

"20 Years After JonBenét’s Murder, The Ramseys Still Look Guilty As Hell","As the 20th anniversary of JonBenét Ramsey’s murder approaches, a series of true crime television shows, culminating with CBS’s two-part docuseries next week, are re-litigating the conspiracy theories surrounding the murder.

When the six-year-old girl was found murdered in her Boulder home on Christmas 1996, the case generated immense national coverage. A lot of the interest was propelled by JonBenét’s beauty queen competitions and the possible sexual nature of the crime (due to the posing of the body) — both of which turned out to have very little to do with the crime.

When I worked in Colorado, I quickly learned how easy it was to become obsessed with the case. Over the eight years I spent as a journalist in Denver, I met a number of people who’d been involved with the investigation in some capacity. Almost all of them advanced a similar view: One of the parents had killed her, and both had covered up the crime.

This isn’t exactly a contrarian position. It’s worth remembering that in 1999 (uncovered in 2013) a grand jury voted to indict both parents, John and Patsy, in the death of JonBenét. They voted to charge the parents with felony child abuse resulting in death, accessory to first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. Boulder’s district attorney Alex Hunter, as he had done many times before, decided not to move forward due to lack of evidence.

There was never compelling real evidence to back up the intruder theories, save a single shoe print outside that could have been left by any passerby. Other than that, no one could see any prints in the snow-covered December ground. The Boulder police had come up with a list of 25 reasons the intruder theory was unlikely.

Without a confession from at least one or the other, we will likely never know exactly what happened. Patsy Ramsey is now dead. But while it might be entertaining to contemplate conspiracies– and there is plenty of forensic evidence to talk about, as well — investigators were always being pulled in one direction for sound reasons.

There Were Never Any Other Suspects

Re-reading Lawrence Schiller’s “Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,” the most comprehensive and reliable book written on the topic, reminded me how well-founded and reasonable it is to suspect the Ramseys. One of the problems police faced was the prospect of figuring out which of two strong suspects they should pursue.

Every detective in the case’s infancy agreed on one thing: the biggest mistake in the weeks after JonBenét’s murder was the failure to arrest Patsy Ramsey and question her. “The detectives were sure that if only Hunter had agreed to jail Patsy—even for a short time—she would have caved in,” writes Schiller.

Cops argued that such an arrest was standard procedure when a child is murdered in the home. Then again, we’re talking about the quixotic folks in peaceful Boulder, Colorado. So nothing happened. The police had already allowed a contamination of the crime scene—permitting the parents and friends to move the body; at one point allowing a group to pray over JonBenét. (We won’t dive too deeply into the bizarre circumstances surrounding the discovery of JonBenét’s body by her father John in the clandestine room in the basement, where a witness claimed John cried out before even turning on the lights to see the body.)



Then there was the Boulder DA’s constant dithering and an activist detective who joined the investigation and became an advocate on the Ramsey’s behalf after bonding with John over religion. The police investigated everyone who had come into contact with the Ramseys. They traveled around the country chasing down leads. They spoke to countless experts. They interviewed all friends and family. They always ended up in the same place.*

The Killer Didn’t Act Like An Intruder

Every item involved in killing JonBenét was found inside the house, including the pad and pen used to write the “ransom note,” the broken paintbrush, duct tape, rope and ligature used to pose the girl (police had evidence that Patsy probably purchased the latter two items from a hardware store earlier that month) and the flashlight (the likely murder weapon).

This was a pivotal fact. The question investigators kept asking was: What kind of sophisticated, highly motivated sexual predator and would-be kidnapper breaks into a house planning an abduction and rape of a young girl without bringing a single tool of the trade with him?

Then again, what kind of highly motivated sexual predator and would-be kidnapper would feel comfortable hanging around a house long enough to write a three-page ransom note after he’d just murdered a screaming child (neighbors told police they heard a scream, but no one in the house did, allegedly)? If the perpetrator had enough time to write a note at the home, he had enough time to move JonBenét’s body somewhere else.

Even more importantly, why would he stick around to write a ransom note when the prospect of deriving any money from the crime had already been lost? The only reasonable conclusion, according to an FBI report—and almost everyone agreed the ransom note was written after the murder; the perpetrator could have brought one along if he had planned a kidnapping—was that the note had been left behind in an attempt to hide the killer’s identity and motive.

The Ransom Note Implicates Patsy

Other aspects of the letter pointed to an insider, as well. Or, I should say one insider.

The FBI concluded that ransom notes almost always have fingerprints or signs of “handling, creasing, or damage.” This one had nothing but evidence of Patsy. She also claimed she’d stepped over the three sheets of paper that were neatly spread across the bottom of a spiral staircase to get to the kitchen. Believing a child left it there, she returned to it later—which worked well for the timeline of her calling 911, etc. When detectives reenacted this scene, however, they found it was impossible. She could not pass without stepping on the papers. Either she forgot or lied.

The FBI’s Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit had noted that JonBenét’s murderer almost certainly hadn’t commited a murder before. They also concluded separately that the ransom note was written by someone intelligent but criminally unsophisticated.

So it should not be surprising that the ransom letter was a mess of contradictions, composed by someone who had no purpose other than covering up a crime and diverting attention. As one investigator pointed out, many of the phrases—“foreign factions” and other silly terms—were curiously similar to quotes from movies that had recently been shown on TV. The letter begins with “Mr. Ramsey” and ends with “John,” and infamously includes a monetary demand that matched John’s recent bonus check—an obvious way to deflect blame towards his colleagues.

Moreover, lab tests also showed it was Patsy’s Sharpie pen used to write the note. The pen used to write the note—an FBI profiler estimates it took 21 minutes for the author to practice on the pad and then compose it—was found in a cup with other Sharpies right next to the phone in the kitchen where Patsy kept them. It was very conscientious of the murderer to put everything back where he found it.

While handwriting analysis at the time couldn’t definitively prove Patsy had written the note, of all the people police interviewed, she was the only one who could not be eliminated. A forensic document examiner named Gideon Epstein later examined the note and concluded that there was “no doubt” it was Patsy. Most agreed. Donald Foster, an expert who performed comparisons of phraseology and punctuation at the time, concluded that Patsy was likely to have “written and may have composed the note.”

You Need a Map to Get Around This House

There was another question that baffled investigators. How is it that an intruder had such familiarity in a stranger’s house?

For instance, only the family knew that JonBenét’s urine-soaked sheets and blanket—she was still struggling with bedwetting, a fact that fed many theories about Patsy accidentally killing her daughter in anger—were put directly into the washer and dryer so they wouldn’t stink up the house. Somehow the person who posed JonBenét’s body also did. Yet everyone who had access to the Ramsey home and would have known this was interviewed and cleared.

And what kind of sophisticated, highly motivated sexual predator and would-be kidnapper gets into a millionaire’s house without leaving any evidence of a break-in or escape, and no fingerprints? What kind of killer can put duct tape on a girl and leave behind not a thread of evidence? (The Colorado Bureau of Investigations established that fibers found on the duct tape around JonBenét’s mouth were consistent with the jacket Patsy wore on Christmas.)

When experts retraced the steps of the kidnapper in the dark, maze-like basement, they noted someone who did not know the house intimately could not get around—certainly not with a body.

Finding that hidden basement room—the room that people searching for JonBenét had initially missed—was improbable. In the dark? Almost impossible. Yet there was no evidence that any of the lights had been turned on that night.

“Who gives a f**k if every window and every door was open in the house?” Schiller quotes a cop saying at the time. A stranger entering the house for the first time would need a map and a guide, he went on.

The Staging Doesn’t Make Sense

If a stranger had really murdered JonBenet, he wouldn’t have to stage the body to make it look like a stranger had murdered her. Why would a stranger use a ligature to pretend to suffocate JonBenét, when he thought she had died from the head injury? Why would a stranger only loosely tie a cord around JonBenét’s arm—after she was dead—to feign she was constrained when she never was? The FBI called this a “staging within staging.”

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation had determined that the flashlight was the murder weapon and that it (and the batteries inside) had probably been wiped of fingerprints. Why would an intruder wipe the flashlight—and open it to wipe the batteries—rather than taking it with him when he left if it was the murder weapon? It’s more probable that someone from inside the house would have panicked and removed the prints.

According to FBI profilers, all of this and the time spent staging the body pointed to a killer who was trying make the murder look like an intruder’s work. It was someone comfortable in the house.

From “Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,” a damning paragraph about the killer:

The way the cord had been made into a noose—with the stick tied 17 inches from the knot—suggested staging rather than a bona fide attempt to strangle JonBenét. It suggested that the killer was a manipulative person, with the courage to believe that he or she could control the subsequent investigation. In short, everything about the crime indicated an attempt at self-preservation on the part of the killer. On the other hand, the killer cared about the victim and wanted her found. He or she didn’t want JonBenét outside in the dead of winter in the middle of the night. The child had been wrapped in a white blanket, her Barbie nightgown found lying next to her. Such caring and solicitude were not usually associated with a malevolent criminal.

None of it made sense if a stranger had done it.

The Ramseys Acted Guilty

It should not be forgotten that most of the investigators were taken aback by the behavior of the Ramseys from the moment the body of their daughter was found.

From Schiller:

They had seemed distant from each other the entire morning, had never tried to comfort each other, and had remained physically separate. Patsy was looking around, peeking through the fingers covering her face, one police report said, while John was off by himself much of the time, out of Arndt’s sight. He had even gone alone into the basement at midmorning, after which time he had become despondent, sitting alone. The Ramseys’ refusal to grant formal interviews until four months after the murder was also highly suspicious, the police said.

John began making arrangements to fly his private jet to Atlanta with his family less than a half an hour after police showed up to remove his daughter’s body. The couple refused to cooperate with the police, soon hiring criminal attorneys. When they did offer interviews with police, the Ramseys made numerous demands that would undermine the veracity of the inquiry. They constantly laid blame on their friends– many of whom found their behavior puzzling. Patsy, one cop noted, had the ability to turn on and off the waterworks or use her Southern charm whenever it suited her. She spoke about herself as a victim and used phrases that were constantly making them suspicious.

Is it possible that someone who knew the family got into the house, pulled JonBenét out of her room upstairs, killed her, walked around the house for a few hours pulling together the many items needed to stage the crime, sat down for almost a half hour to write a ransom note, and then left without waking anyone up? I guess.

There have always been theories floating around about family friends or John’s older son from a previous marriage or JonBenét’s younger older brother. All of them were cleared by police. It always seemed curious to me that people were prepared to blame the neighbors or John’s friends without a shred of evidence, yet unwilling to accept the predominance of proof pointing to the parents.

Anyway, the couple soon moved away and, like O.J., gave up looking for the mysterious killer. It’s a shame that this murderer was allowed to remain a menace to children of Boulder all these years. Fortunately, this madman, who employed such a distinctive and stylized way of killing a poor little girl, never seemed to resurface. Funny enough, though, few people were surprised.

*I guess that’s not exactly true. In 2008, Mary Lacy, then the extraordinarily incompetent district attorney of Boulder, had made it her mission to exonerate the Ramseys. She wrote a cloying open letter clearing the couple of any wrongdoing and then generated a lot of excitement around the country by arresting John Mark Karr, a weird man who was living in Thailand for conspicuous reasons. Karr had confessed to killing JonBenét. My newspaper—and every other major media outlet—rushed to send reporters to Bangkok to learn more. Macy, and others, used the self-generated story to attack those who had been critical of the Ramseys. Yet all rational people quickly discerned that Karr was unwell, and that he couldn’t have possibly had anything to do with the case. Karr was soon released. [Go back.]

CBS’s JonBenet Ramsey Documentary Was Complete Garbage,"It would take a book-length piece to debunk the many risible insinuations of CBS’s “The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey,” but, alas, we all have to let go of our obsessions at some point. I will, soon. Now, I realize producers of true-crime docuseries need to float theories and feign new explosive evidence to gin up interest and ratings. It’s a shame they chose to indulge in Jerry Springer-esque pseudojournalism when a fact-driven version — not only of the murder, but the people, place, time, and aftermath — would have been far more fascinating.

In this case, producers went on national television and pinned the murder of JonBenét on then-nine-year-old Burke. Without a shred of new or compelling evidence, a panel of experts came to the conclusion that he killed his sister, six-year-old JonBenét, by accident “in a fit of rage, perhaps over a toy or her eating his food.”

Perhaps.

If it’s only conjecture, sure, it’s not completely implausible that Burke was involved. This theory has been around since 1996. There was always consensus that someone in the house did it. But why Burke, and not Patsy or John? It’s as if there’s a psychological block that won’t allow people to accept that wealthy, outwardly respectable parents could be responsible for this kind of evil.

Why is it that people theorizing about this case find it more plausible that a child — who was “violent” in the way any nine-year boy is violent — was capable of murder, but not parents who covered up the crime: posing their young daughter’s body by tying her up, taping her mouth shut, using a ligature on her, and then sexually abusing her with a paintbrush. A nine-year-old doesn’t have the gruesome sophistication to pull that kind of staging off. (The only tool used in the murder that connected to Burke in any way was a red pocket knife that was used to cut the cords. The knife had been taken away from the boy by a nanny weeks earlier and hidden, its whereabouts only known to adults in the house.)

For years, by the way, the Ramseys not only denied their own involvement but insinuated that their one-time friends had murdered JonBenét.

If Burke had done it, why also did Patsy lie about incidents that would have implicated her — what she had fed the kids the night before (her fingerprints were on the pineapple bowl, as well), how she found the ransom note, etc. — rather than lie to protect Burke?

The police ruled Burke out a number of times during the investigation. They interviewed him three times — once for three straight days — without the parents being present. The interview was videotaped, and yet neither the FBI, nor the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, nor any of the detectives at the time suspected Burke of being involved in the murder.

Then there is the 1999 grand jury that voted to indict the Ramsey parents for first-degree murder resulting from child abuse. The jurors had access to all this evidence. They could not agree which of the parents had done it, so they decided to pursue a case against both. But the jury never implicated the child, even though Burke had testified before that grand jury for an entire day. At the time, Alex Hunter, then districtattorney, went out of his way to publicly announce that the boy had no involvement in the murder. (The Ramseys were never “cleared,” as some people suggest.)

Burke also went back to school pretty quickly after the murder, which telegraphed to the FBI and the Boulder police that it was highly unlikely he knew anything about the murder, much less was involved in it. In almost every other way, the Ramseys acted as if they were hiding something. So if John and Patsy thought their nine-year-old child was harboring secrets about the killing of their daughter — or that he had done it, which they would have known — they would never have let him walk into a situation where he could talk freely to others.

This, from the definitive, “Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: JonBenét and the City of Boulder” by Lawrence Schiller:

If he had secrets, Burke could easily share them with classmates he trusted. Burke’s return to school seemed to close the door on the possibility that he knew something he hadn’t told investigators.

Setting all that aside, though, it’s worth pointing out that almost all of the two-part series’ supposedly explosive new evidence was already reported by journalists in Colorado and elsewhere, and known to anyone who cared to read about the case. It would take forever to go through all of it, but just take some of the big “bombshells,” according to Entertainment Tonight.

The 911 call, for instance. Those watching the series might have been under the impression, as Entertainment Weekly was, that the “first and probably biggest reveal” was the six seconds at the end of the 911 call Patsy made after supposedly finding a ransom note, where Burke is heard saying, “What did you find?”

Well, way back in 1996, a Boulder detective noticed the pause after Patsy’s 911 call, and sent the tape to the Secret Service and then a California firm specializing in enhancing audio. She noted that Patsy said, “Help me Jesus, help me Jesus.” She noted there was another voice, probably Burke’s, saying “Please, what do I do?” She noted that John had probably said, “We’re not speaking to you.” Yes, she also noted Burke saying, “What did you find?” (If he was the murderer, why would he ask that?)

None of this was new. The modern enhancement probably made it clearer, but it’s hardly a bombshell. The police believed, very early on, that Burke had probably come down and interrupted the Ramseys when they were calling police.

Then there is the ransom note. As I’ve covered earlier, it was almost unanimous among experts and investigators that Patsy probably wrote and helped compose the infamous ransom note. Police knew that the author of the note was comfortable enough in the house to spend nearly a half hour writing it. They knew it had no other purpose than to mislead police.

Still, the experts in “The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey” offered viewers the “jaw-dropping” discovery “that multiple lines from the note were taken from movies like Dirty Harry and Speed.”

Well, back 1996, police detectives had already covered this. They noted that quotes from the ransom notes were similar to Clint Eastwood quotes from “Dirty Harry,” which had aired on TBS in Colorado the month before JonBenét’s murder. They noted that the night she was killed, “Nick of Time,” a Johnny Depp movie about a political “faction” kidnapping a six-year-old girl, was on TV. The ransom note talks about a small “faction,” etc. Detectives noted that “Speed” had been on, and in it Dennis Hopper says, “Do not attempt to grow a brain.” The Ramsey ransom note says, “Don’t try to grow a brain John.”

It went on and on like this. Really, “The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey” allowed experts to rehash old evidence and offer a theory that was no more informed than one made by anyone who could use Google. The only thing the series proves is that JonBenét will never have her justice.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/20/cbss-jonbenet-ramsey-documentary-was-complete-garbage/,2016-09-20
"If Keith Lamont Scott Had Followed Gun Laws, Would He Still Be Alive?","The black man shot and killed by a black police officer in Charlotte, N.C. Tuesday was a felon who had gone to prison for seven years, making it illegal for him to possess a firearm.

According to records from Bexar County, Texas, Keith Lamont Scott was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in July 2005 and sentenced to seven years in prison. In relation to that case, he was charged and found guilty of evading arrest. He was also charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon, reckless driving, and assaulting his wife, but these charges were later dismissed.

Here is information about the case from the Bexar County Clerk of Court, followed by the list of other charges in Texas:

As reported in the Charlotte Observer (but buried at the very bottom of a lengthy post), Scott also has a criminal history in North Carolina and South Carolina, dating back to 1992.

A public records search shows Scott was convicted in April 2004 of a misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon charge in Mecklenburg County. Other charges stemming from that date were dismissed: felony assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and the misdemeanors assault on a child under 12, assault on a female, and communicating threats. In 1992, Scott was charged in Charleston County, S.C., with several different crimes on different dates, including carrying a concealed weapon (not a gun), simple assault, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He pleaded guilty to all charges. Scott also was charged with aggravated assault in 1992 and assault with intent to kill in 1995. Both charges were reduced, but the disposition of the cases is unclear.

Scott’s criminal record is significant in light of police reports that he was carrying a gun at the time of his fatal encounter with a police officer this week. Under federal law (18 U.S.C 922(g)(1-9)), it is illegal for anyone who has been “convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” to possess a firearm.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police chief told reporters Wednesday that officers have said Scott had a handgun when he got out of his car. When he refused to drop the weapon, that’s when officers shot him.

“It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” Chief Kerr Putney said.

Video footage from a dash-cam of the incident was made available to Scott’s family Wednesday. After viewing the video, the family said they wanted the videos released to the public immediately. In an emailed statement, the family’s attorney, Justin Bamberg, said, “After watching the videos, the family again has more questions than answers.”

Bamberg said it was impossible to see what was in Scott’s hands, and that “he was slowly walking backwards” when he was shot.

Despite reports from sources within the department that say the video shows Scott with a gun, Putney also said he can’t see Scott’s hands well enough to determine whether he was holding a weapon.

“The angle in which he’s standing, I can’t see his hands,” Putney told CNN. “Therefore, I can’t see a weapon in his hands or him pointing a weapon that would be in his hands. I can’t see, based on the angle, that definitive piece of visual evidence that I need.”

However, Putney said, a gun was found at the scene beside Scott.

“We have various statements that he had the weapon, that he wouldn’t drop it, after repeated verbal commands,” Putney said. “At the incident, there is a weapon recovered right there in close proximity to the subject.”

When Megyn Kelly of Fox News asked Putney Thursday night if he had “any doubt” that Scott had a gun, the police chief said even though it would be good to have video evidence, sometimes that’s not enough.

“There’s a lot of other evidence that I can’t speak to further,” he said. “The State Bureau of Investigations, an independent investigative body, has taken over. I really can’t speak to the investigation further, but there’s a lot of other evidence that gives us a great deal of support and comfort that the version that you heard from us before is supported by the evidence. . . . that version is still very much accurate.”

When Kelly asked him about fingerprints on the gun and whether it was registered to Scott, Putney said that’s all very relevant, but he can’t speak about it now with the ongoing investigation.

Having a criminal record like Scott’s doesn’t give police officers license to shoot. However, the facts about Scott’s criminal history cast doubt on the narrative that he was a gentle family man who was just sitting in his car reading a book.

"Question The Stories You Tell Yourself About Terrorism, Shootings","This last week I attended a panel discussion on Islamophobia and my Facebook friends reacted to the news that in North Carolina a black police officer had shot a black man who may have been armed. These might seem unrelated, but they were not. These experiences were really about the exact same thing: the human capacity to form narratives and hold on to them regardless of the evidence.

Let’s start with the panel. Three professors took turns speaking, concluding the narrative many Americans have developed about Arabs and Islam is not accurate. Many people fear Arabs because they’re Muslim. But there are in fact a lot of Christian, Sikh, and even agnostic Arabs.

Many people also often fear Muslims because of all the terrorist attacks. However, you are much more likely to be killed by lightning than by an Islamic extremist. According to one of the lecturers, Islamic extremism has only killed 109 Americans since September 11, 2001. That might sound like a lot, and every life is precious, but if you run the numbers, there is an infinitesimally small chance that you’ll be one of them. Many more people die falling out of bed: that kills 737 Americans annually.

This panel pointed out that often the narratives we develop are inaccurate, and need to be questioned. If we don’t question them, bad things happen—in this case, Islamophobia. Islamophobia has led to violence against Arabs, hate killings, and alienating many American citizens. Although many people struggling with Islamophobia might feel that Muslims and Arabs are attacking their way of life, destabilizing their country, and undoing the social fabric of their community, these feelings don’t make it true. But people typically continue to believe their narratives despite the evidence.

To Wake Others, We Need To Respect Them

Now, people’s feelings still matter even if they don’t reflect the truth of a situation. If people feel this way, we need to address it. We need to talk about it. We need to be open to hear their voices, and offer our own alternative interpretations respectfully, lovingly, and with an open mind.

In other words, we have to be willing to question our own narratives if we want to ask others to question theirs. We need to be open. If we’re not open, it’s very easy to become extreme. That’s the message I took away from the panel.

However, the opposite message filled my newsfeeds the day after Keith Scott was killed. A lot of my friends posted articles about how we need to shut down the hurtful narratives that oppose Black Lives matter. One article went so far as to say if you can’t promote BLM then give the mic away and let someone else speak.

I value the idea of letting someone else speak, but this was not a message of openness. It was a message of restriction, and of doubling down on a single narrative. The idea was that if you don’t agree with this message, shut up. There was no place for an alternative narrative. Of course not everyone feels this way, but apparently a lot of my friends do.

So what’s the problem with just validating someone’s narrative? If they feel that way, shouldn’t that be a good enough reason to validate it? Well, not when it comes to Islamophobia. Instead, when people feel one way, sometimes the most important and healthy response is to lovingly present an alternative narrative.

This is a basic skill for maintaining mental health. It’s the primary skill cognitive behavioral therapists teach to their patients. When people are depressed, it’s often because they have a hard time not interpreting their experiences in a singular way. When someone is anorexic, it can be the result of inaccurate stories he tells himself about food and health. When someone is paranoid, it often comes from false beliefs about the world.

It’s Time to Question Your Own Narrative

Cognitive behavioral therapy isn’t just for people with mental illness. Opening our minds to alternatives helps us all deal with things more intentionally and productively. For example, The New York Times publicized a study conducted by Roland Fryer, a black professor at Harvard University who studies methods of reducing racial achievement gaps. Fryer studied more than 1,000 shootings in 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida, and California. He found police officers were slightly more likely to shoot white individuals than black individuals (his study of course adjusted for all those things like racial density). This surprised Fryer.

When we’re dealing with people being killed, I feel a need to say that a death is always tragic regardless of who the person is, where he is from, or what he has done in his life. Killing someone ends possibility, crushes expectations, and affects many people. Yet if we’re honest, very few people are shot and killed by police officers, and there’s a good chance race may not be a significant deciding factor.

If on average it’s not a racial issue, we can still talk about restricting lethal force, but we would need to start by finding out how much there really is. According to Fryer’s study, there were 1.6 million arrests in Houston over five years and officers only fired their weapons 507 times. That means a gun wasn’t fired during an arrest 99.97 percent of the time. So while we are all more likely to be shot by a police officer than by an Islamic extremist, you’re still pretty safe from both.

If you’re walking down the street scared that an Arab is going to kill you, you need to question your narrative. And if you’re walking down the street fearing the cops are going to shoot you, you also need to question your narrative. So why are people scared of these things? Because our brains are storytelling machines and once you’ve developed a narrative it’s very hard to doubt it. Instead, whenever another bomb goes off or another black man is shot, we add that to our bag of confirmation.

But our ability to confirm our own narratives doesn’t change the facts. The fact remains that you’re pretty safe from cops and Islamic extremists alike.

Keeping an Open Mind Helps You Stay Free

Clinging too tightly to a narrative can cause you to miss the more compelling and honest story. When Fryer allowed himself to question the pervasive narrative, he realized that while lethal force is not very common, nonlethal force is. As a result, he discovered that black people are more likely to be frisked, cuffed, pepper-sprayed, etc. than white people. Rather than reinforcing an old narrative, his openness allowed him to discover something perhaps even more crucial.

So Fryer began to focus on the ways minor acts of force might have a larger effect on black lives. By questioning his narrative, Fryer might have found something more interesting, vital, and ubiquitous. Fryer’s conclusion is that perhaps we should focus on the nonlethal stuff because that happens all the time and leads to black disillusionment.

In his own words: “Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It’s an awful experience. Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower-level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.”

So what did the incidents following Scott’s death and the panel discussion at North Carolina State University about Islamophobia have in common? They’re both about humans and narratives. Narratives are like ruts our brains follow. We have to be willing to step out and consider other perspectives if we want to see where we’re going. Questioning our narratives is hard and uncomfortable, and can leave us feeling anchorless. But it can also free us to sail and find new and better moorings.

CNN Has Absolutely No Clue How Gun Laws Work,"CNN published on Tuesday a comprehensive update on the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by police in Charlotte, North Carolina. The article, entitled “Keith Scott Shooting: What we know a week later” and written by CNN reporters Catherine Shoichet and Polo Sandoval, purports to tell readers all of the relevant facts surrounding the shooting. Unfortunately, the CNN report leaves out some vital facts while wildly misstating or misrepresenting others.

The most glaring omission in the report is any mention that police witnessed Scott in possession of illegal drugs. That fact is key, because Scott’s simultaneous possession of a firearm and use of illegal drugs is a glaring violation of both state and federal law. When police initially witnessed Scott in possession of marijuana, which is illegal under both federal law and North Carolina law, they chose to ignore it, because they were in the area to serve a warrant on a separate individual. He was not a priority at that time. Police did not move in on Scott until they also witnessed him brandishing a gun while under the influence of illegal drugs.

It is impossible to understand how or why police chose to confront Scott without knowing about his use of illegal drugs and his illegal possession of a firearm while under the influence of illegal drugs. Here’s how Slate described the importance of this fact in this article with the headline “Marijuana Possession Played Key Role in Police Shooting of Keith Scott”:

Possession of marijuana played a significant role in the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference that officers were trying to serve a warrant for someone else when they spotted Scott rolling “what they believed to be a marijuana ‘blunt’ ” in his car. At first they allegedly didn’t think much of it, until they saw Scott had a weapon and thought, “uh-oh, this is a safety issue for us and the public,” Putney said.

The omission by CNN of Scott’s drug use is by itself enough to tar the rest of CNN’s attempt at objective reporting, but CNN’s reporting only gets worse from there. In fact, it appears that CNN has little to no understanding about the federal and state laws governing possession and use of handguns in North Carolina:

Officers decided to approach Scott after Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott hold up a gun up while in his SUV, police have said.



North Carolina is an open-carry state, meaning gun owners can carry their firearms in public and openly in their vehicles.

That is not true. North Carolina law does not allow all “gun owners” to carry firearms in public and openly in their vehicles. North Carolina law allows legal gun owners to openly carry firearms in public without a permit. Scott was not a legal gun owner by any stretch of the imagination. As a formerly imprisoned felon convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Scott was permanently banned from gun possession and gun ownership by both federal and state law.

In addition to omitting Scott’s illegal drug use, CNN also conveniently forgot to disclose that Scott was not allowed to so much as touch a gun, let alone carry one around in public. Scott’s gun possession didn’t just violate one gun law (the law against felon possession), but two (the law against possession while under the influence). CNN didn’t see fit to mention either of these key facts, which undoubtedly influenced the police decision to confront him.

But let’s get back to CNN’s implication that Scott was legally allowed to be handling his firearm in his car because North Carolina is an “open carry” state. CNN’s passive-aggressive assertion requires a near-total ignorance of how open-carry laws like those in North Carolina actually work.

For starters, Scott was not “open carrying.” He was actually carrying his weapon concealed in an ankle holster, and he was doing so without a permit (state law prohibits the state from issuing concealed carry permits to convicted felons like Scott). According to the North Carolina Department of Justice, “It is unlawful to transport a weapon (absent a proper permit) that is BOTH concealed and readily accessible to a person.” Even if Scott were not prohibited from carrying any weapon, concealed or otherwise, his method of carry in his vehicle was a clear violation of North Carolina law. A gun concealed in an ankle holster, itself concealed by someone’s pants, is the near-polar opposite of “open carrying.”

This brings us to CNN’s next egregious error. “Open carry” laws do not allow individuals to walk around in public with a gun in their hand. In the absence of an imminent mortal threat which requires the threat and potential use of deadly force, handling a firearm in public is a gigantic no-no. The term used for this type of illegal handling is called “brandishing.” Open-carry laws do not, by any stretch of the imagination, authorize individuals to brandish firearms or to openly handle them in such a manner that a reasonable person would take the exhibition of the weapon to be a threat.

Contrary to what CNN suggested, the term “open carry” has a near-universal legal definition: it is the visible carrying (not handling) of a weapon via a visible holster for handguns, or via a shoulder or chest-mounted sling for a rifle. Police officers open-carry their handguns on a belt-mounted holster, usually on their hips.

Rather than lawfully open carrying, as CNN implies Scott was doing, Scott was actually a felon (legally banned from gun possession) under the influence of drugs (which also legally bans an individual from gun possession) who was carrying a concealed weapon (which is banned for non-permit holders) which he then brandished (also illegal) and which he then refused to surrender to police (also illegal).

It would be extremely difficult for Scott to have simultaneously violated any more gun laws than he did. Police saw him smoking marijuana and decided to give him a pass on his apparent penchant for weed since they were focused on more important matters. It wasn’t until Scott, by openly using illegal drugs while in possession of a firearm, left police no choice but to confront him. Yet CNN didn’t just refuse to provide that information, its reporters went out of their way to mischaracterize North Carolina’s gun laws. Its readers deserve better than lies and half-truths about what happened in Charlotte.

How Black Lives Matter-Style Activism Is Ruining America,"When the Ferguson riots broke out in 2014, the nation was shocked and alarmed. The press gave the event wall-to-wall coverage for a week. For young people this was fairly new territory, while older people had flashbacks to the Los Angeles riots of 1992, or even (if they were old enough) the Watts riots of 1965. These were alarming connections. Weren’t we past all this stuff?

The Baltimore riots in 2015 were a bit less shocking. This was a movie we’d all just seen. By the time we got to Charlotte, the element of surprise had been completely lost. Deadly race riots are starting to take on the banality of “same old, same old.” I’ve actually started looking forward to winter as a less riot-friendly season. It’s pretty depressing that we’ve reached the point where that line of thought makes sense.

Here’s the real tragedy of Ferguson, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Charlotte, and any other cities that haven’t yet been sacked but soon may be. Taken in themselves, the problems that drive this frustration are reasonably soluble. Unfortunately, just about everyone seems to prefer narrative-peddling to problem-solving. It’s easier and more fun.

As we all double down on our rightness, soluble problems morph into massive, mangled webs of anger and angst, and American cities go on burning.

America Is Not Drowning in Crime

Here’s the basic reality. Crime rates in America have gone down quite a bit since the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, we still have relatively high rates of violent crime compared to other Western nations, and our murder rate has ticked up a bit over the past year.

Crime is again bubbling up as a domestic concern for ordinary American voters. At the first presidential debate, Donald Trump gave a mostly incoherent speech on crime, in which he took care to use the words “law” and “order” repeatedly, obviously signaling that he wishes to inherit the mantle of law-and-order conservatism. Those memes had been fading from the conservative electoral playbook, so Trump’s ham-fisted attempts at reviving them are worthy of comment.

Most people fail to understand that crime is quite a localized problem in America. There are places where murder is rampant, and places where it’s shocking and rare. That’s partly related to gangs, which are turf-oriented such that you pretty much know where to find them.

Actual gang murders are just one piece of the puzzle, though. In some neighborhoods, the social fabric has decayed, and bad blood between police and residents goes back many years. Solving crimes is challenging when residents are afraid of being labeled “snitches.” Cops get frustrated, and some start bending the rules. Relations deteriorate further.

It’s understandable that residents of these neighborhoods are frustrated. It’s tough to grow up in a place where you regularly feel unsafe. It’s hard feeling that you (or your kids) are seen as suspicious every time you wear a hoodie or have something bulky in your coat pocket.

Still, we should understand that this is not most of America. We’ve heard a lot lately about elite “bubble dwellers” who can’t understand the problems of ordinary people, but with respect to violent crime, it might be more accurate to see these sorts of neighborhoods as “bubbled.” Crime is still a problem in America, but it isn’t the sort of pervasive problem that’s driving people into gated-community islands of safety. In most places, our police are doing a pretty good job.

Crime Control Problems Are Soluble

That’s the first piece of good news. The second is that we’ve made significant advances in crime control over the past 20 years. Research and data analysis have given us vastly improved analytics, enabling us to direct resources to criminal hot spots. Better surveillance and communication reduces response times. Advances are also being made in training methods that help police to respond more appropriately to addicts, juveniles, and the mentally ill.

In many areas, improved transparency for police departments is also warranted. Unions and corrupt officials have enabled bad policing practices to become entrenched especially in many urban areas that have for decades been under near-exclusive Democratic control. In some cities (most obviously Chicago), law enforcement needs some restructuring and rebranding. But even in Chicago, substantial improvement should be possible, if we could think of the problem in terms of police transparency and crime control.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to fix anything in America today, when reform efforts are so easily hijacked by nefarious national narratives.

A Problem of Misdiagnosis

Americans have a narrative problem. We just like our narratives way, way too much. We’re starting to fall prey to narrative-induced paralysis.

This problem has fairly deep historical roots, especially for the black community. Looking at our list of American heroes, what sorts of people do we find? In general, our most-prized moral exemplars are prophetic figures whose main social contribution was to speak truth to power.

Martin Luther King Jr. never had much of a head for policy, but he was a genius at making a moral point. In a similar mold, we lavish admiration on Mahatma Ghandi, the suffragettes, and heartstring-pulling writers like Upton Sinclair, W.E.B. DuBois, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Americans just love our awareness-raisers. We like them enough that we’re even sometimes willing to forgive certain lapses from Ghandi’s and King’s non-violent protest model.

In some cases, awareness-raisers really are heroic. (Jesus Christ is my personal favorite, although Elijah was also pretty great.) At other times, our obsession with awareness may actually blind us to the real solutions. Not every problem comes back to a widespread deficiency of human concern.

What if most Americans already agree that “black lives matter”? What if our policing and crime-control problems actually call for some prudent policy adjustments, and not a nationwide lifting of hearts and minds? High-minded but ineffective solutions can often be worse than useless insofar as they deter people from focusing on what really needs to be done. If a friend has a headache, you offer him an aspirin first, not a Bible.

Black Lives Matter is currently giving us a heartbreaking tutorial in the consequences of misapplied social activism. Just a few months ago we could argue about the reality of “the Ferguson effect,” but now we seem to be hurtling forward to a point where every black victim of a police shooting is potentially seen as the next Rodney King. It’s no longer necessary to wait for the verdict, or even for basic forensic analysis. Hearsay is enough to start the looting.

Needless to say, these developments are creating an extreme crime control challenge for city officials. No cop wants his city to be the next Ferguson. But how can police chiefs send cops into high-crime neighborhoods without giving them leave to defend themselves against potentially deadly attacks? The longer-term consequences of that kind of undisciplined “demonstration” will be more gang-controlled neighborhoods, and more black deaths.

Meanwhile, if Black Lives Matter goes on demonstrating its disdain for relevant facts and procedures, more and more Americans will lose sympathy for the cause. Can a narrative kill you? In a way, maybe it can.

Leashing Our Unruly Narratives

I’m not trying to blame everything on liberals. Conservatives have narrative problems too. We have a bad habit of deflecting any criticisms of our justice system by playing the “Daniel Patrick Moynihan” card. Rather than discuss seriously whether our police, courts, or correctional policies would benefit from reforms, we’d prefer to talk about the collapse of the family and how this is mostly the fault of liberals and the welfare state.

We could buy ourselves some credibility by taking an interest in shorter-term solutions for struggling neighborhoods.

This all makes perfect sense when you understand the twin policy arcs of the late twentieth century, along with their corresponding political narratives. Liberals responded to poverty and social decay with a spate of entitlement programs, while conservatives promoted aggressive law enforcement. Both approaches had some drawbacks (not necessarily equally serious), but naturally everybody prefers to discuss where the other guy fell short.

Moynihan’s argument that the welfare state would further destabilize the black family, thus locking millions in a crippling cycle of poverty and dysfunction, looks awfully prescient in hindsight. That’s somewhat beside the point, though, for addressing immediate crime-control problems. We’re not going to re-instill the traditional family model overnight. When conservatives talk about Moynihan in the wake of a controversial police shooting, liberals (understandably) read that as, “Nothing can actually be done here, but just so you know, this is all your fault.”

Moynihan’s analysis can be mostly true without being the most relevant truth for every circumstance. We could buy ourselves some credibility by taking an interest in shorter-term solutions for struggling neighborhoods. It’s easier to give lectures on family values when you’re already involved in the neighborhoods that need to hear them.

There are times when activism and high-minded moralizing really are effective catalysts for positive change. There are other times when the sermonizing just wastes time and energy that could be put into building things that work. Let’s fire the activists, and start hiring more good cops.

The United Nations Call For U.S. Reparations Is Completely Whack,"A United Nations team called the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent conducted a 10-day mission to the United States this past January to investigate the state of black people in our country. The team did not just decide to come on their own; they were invited by “the government of the United States,” presumably at the behest of President Obama. Naturally, as a black person I was keenly interested in their findings.

The members of the UN team were Mireille Fanon-Mendès-France, Sabelo Gumedze, and Ricardo Sunga III. Does that first name sound familiar? Fanon-Mendès-France is the daughter of the famous Marxist, anti-colonialist, far-left activist Frantz Fanon. Some might see similarities between his philosophy and that of President Obama, but I’ll leave that to readers.

During their week and a half visit, the working group visited New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, Baltimore, and Jackson, Mississippi, meeting with various local government bodies and activist groups. They also met with the White House and the Congressional Black Caucus. Many of their meetings were coordinated by the U.S. Human Rights Network, a conglomeration of leftist activist groups, as well as the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, an organ of the State Department engaged in left-leaning causes and headed by a Democrat and Obama appointee.

As the final product of their U.S. travels, the working group has released a report with their findings and recommendations. Sadly, it fails to mention much, and what it does mention is largely wrong. I’ll highlight three of the report’s findings that are problematic, three things they failed to find, and then generally why the report is misguided.

What’s Wrong with the Findings

Firstly: The panel argues “The dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the United States population. Hate crime groups, including white supremacist terror groups, are still active in the United States, targeting African Americans, as was seen in the attack at a church in Charleston in 2015.”

The Charleston shooting was not carried out by a white supremacist group. It was carried out by a lone crazed maniac. Also, those influenced by or sympathetic to Black Lives Matter have called for and actually carried out police officer killings.

The Dallas sniper who murdered five police officers told negotiators “he was upset about Black Lives Matter. He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.” A black Dallas police officer is even filing a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter for inciting violence against police officers. Further, Black Lives Matter supporters have rioted and destroyed property in Charlotte, North Carolina, and have called for killing white people. So why no mention of their hateful, racist ideology?

Secondly: The report erroneously elevates incidents of police killings of black people to a serious national problem, when in fact far, far more black people kill each other than do police. In fact, for every one black person killed by a while police officer, 71 black people are killed by another black person.

Also, the data shows that blacks are killed by the police in proportion to the rate at which they commit crime, meaning the police do not disproportionately target them for violence. The report fails to consider these facts when painting the false picture that out-of-control police are unfairly targeting black people.

Thirdly: The report says we should address today the evil problem of past lynchings. But there are two problems with this. First, white people today are not responsible for lynchings of the past, so making them pay for it is unjust. Secondly, as with incidents of police killing black people, this past problem is dwarfed by black murder. According to Tuskegee University, a total of 4,733 black people were lynched from 1882 to 1959. Yet over the past 35 years, an average of about 9,000 black men have killed each other every single year.

Wrap your head around that. Every single year, black men are killing each other at numbers higher than the total of all of the lynchings that ever happened in the history of the United States.

Here’s What the Report Fails to Mention

The report contains no mention of the fact that 72 percent of black kids are born to single mothers, and that this is a major contributing factor topoverty, crime, and educational outcomes for black Americans. It makes no mention of putting the family back together as a way of improving conditions for black people in America.

The report does not mention that the black murder rate is eight times higher than the white murder rate, and that even though black people are only 14 percent of the population, they are about half of all murderers. Indeed, black people are painted only as victims of crime, not committers of crime with deep family, community, moral, and spiritual dysfunction causing them to be that way.

Although the report makes cursory mention of the “root causes of crime,” the authors never develop this into an argument about methods to stop black people from killing each other.

The report also contains no mention of the deep brokenness in black culture, including: a thug culture that glorifies violence, misogyny, criminal behavior, and incarceration, and is spread by a complicit media through music and pop culture. Nor does it tackle the “acting white” phenomenon, in which black kids’ popularity goes down as their GPA goes up. This means certain segments of black culture actually glorify being dumb and the criminal lifestyle. Any solution to the issues facing black people must address these problems, but they’re totally absent from the UN report.

The report concludes with a long list of recommendations, including a call for reparations for “enslavement and racial discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present.” The problem is that the United States has already spent $22 trillion on the War on Poverty, even though it’s been largely ineffective in eliminating poverty among black people.

Does this not count as reparations? What about other programs, like minority preferences for government contracts? How would one measure how much reparations is enough? And why should white people today have to pay for what happened in 1619? Further, why doesn’t the working group call for involving the black church in the solutions to these problems, since it’s one of the oldest and most influential of institutions in black communities?

Ultimately, although the report was published by the UN, it reads like it was written by Obama, the Congressional Black Caucus, and leftist activist groups. The working group would have more credibility if it included voices other than the far-left, such as churches, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, and beat police officers who deal with black criminals and witness daily the terror they cause in black communities.

Thankfully, the report is non-binding and its recommendations will not be adopted. But it’s perhaps a sneak peek into the kind of policies that President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats might implement if they had complete control of all branches of government.

6 Things That Made The Veep Debate Better Than Trump’s And Clinton’s,"The American people can be so delightfully politically schizophrenic. “What we wouldn’t give for some normal candidates having a discussion of policy in basically polite terms,” they say. “Here are two,” says the vice presidential debate. “HARD PASS,” say the American people.

Ratings will tell the whole story of how many passed, but I didn’t, and here’s what they missed.

1. Soft Voices

Sotto voce was the word of the day. Vice Presidential candidates Tim Kaine and Mike Pence both sought to temper the respective vocal weaknesses of their running mates by competing to see who could give the most Mr. Rogers-y intro. It was like watching a sober spouse try to interject kindly and gently for her drunker half at a dinner party, putting a gentle hand on his arm.

Except the louder halves weren’t actually in the room, which left the impression the veeps might start slipping on their house shoes and cardigans. Allow their dulcet tones to give you a moment’s reprieve from the specter of a Clinton/Trump race.

2. J. Peterman

Boom:

kaine + pence = peterman pic.twitter.com/B66OEPeOhi — Seinfeld Current Day (@Seinfeld2000) October 5, 2016

3. An Exchange About Policing and Race That Might Be Healthy for America

Both men started with a bit about their personal experiences with law enforcement before delving into policy differences:

Sen. Kaine: Here is what I learned as a mayor and governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between community and the police force, bonds of understanding — that’s between the community and the police — force bonds of understanding. When that gap narrows, it is safer for communities, and for the police. That model works across our country. There are other models that do not work, and overly aggressive more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop and frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community…



Gov. Pence: My uncle was a cop, career cop. On the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I grew up. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us, men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. Let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It has worked in the Hoosier state. We fully support that…



They hear the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy as a reason to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racism. That really has got to stop. When an African-American police officer in Charlotte, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. We mourn with those who mourn, we grieve with those who grieve, and we are saddened at the loss of life.



Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, when she was asked a week ago, whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, should correctly answer was that there is implicit bias and everyone in the United States I just think what we ought to do is stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We assure the public we have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there is a loss of life because of police action, but Senator, please, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement by making accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.

They then segued to a discussion of whether bias exists, with Kaine saying, “People should not be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement,” and Pence saying “I am not afraid to bring that up,” but reiterating that reflexively blaming every shooting on racial bias is counterproductive.

And then they ended up sort of agreeing:

Gov. Pence: I would say that we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I had signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana senate, and very proud about it. I worked in Congress on the second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect institutional bias in criminal justice.

It may have been the most shocking moment of 2016.

4. Someone Who Knows The Facts of Hillary’s Scandals

Again and again, Pence hit Kaine with broad knowledge and intricate details of Hillary’s many scandals. This explanation of the problems with the Clinton Foundation was particularly strong, deliberately couched in terms voters can understand without having obsessively followed the story:

While she was secretary of state, the foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors now, you will need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors and certainly, foreign governments cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions, but the Clintons figure out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and for donors can donate millions of dollars.



And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half of her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.

On Iran, the dangerous legacy of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, Pence wouldn’t let Kaine mischaracterize the Iran deal as having “eliminated the Iranian nuclear weapons program” when it has done no such thing.

When Kaine brought up an “intelligence surge,” Pence came at him with Hillary’s private server, not missing the opportunity Trump missed last week on cybersecurity. This may have been the best line of the debate:

5. Someone Who Could Explain What Stronger Together Means

It’s still not that clear, but it’s better than we’ve seen before. Kaine’s opening statement at least pulled some heart strings and connected the phrase to Hillary’s policies. This makes me suspicious she didn’t help him write that book at all.

It is so great to be back at Longwood in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout over high school. She made history by protesting school segregation — she believes our nation is stronger together, and walkouts led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong history making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. Her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world, not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances, to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.

6. A Heartfelt Discussion of Life

Pence was hampered on this question a bit by Trump’s March comment about punishing women who have abortions, but he was able to highlight the Democratic Party’s extremism, the reversals the party has required of a religious Democrat like Kaine, and the party’s support for two deeply unpopular things— partial-birth abortion and taxpayer funding for abortion.

I appreciate and I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine’s sincere faith. That is shared. But for me, I would tell you for the sanctity of life proceeds out of that ancient principle of God. I tried to stand for the ancient principle of the sanctity of life. I am also very pleased that Indiana became the most pro-adoption state. But what I can’t understand is Hillary Clinton — how she can support a process like partial-birth abortion.



I know you hold pro-life views personally. At the very idea that a child almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them, I cannot in conscience [understand] a party that supports that. I know you have historically opposed taxpayer funding for abortion, but Hillary Clinton wants to repeal the long-standing provision when we said we would not use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. For me, my faith informs my life. For me, it all begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of all human life.

Was it all inconsequential, as vice presidential debates always are? Probably. But it was somehow comforting to visit the alternative reality where there are two normal, pleasant-seeming candidates for president.

"Listen To Black Lives Matter Supporters, Don't Dismiss Them","In a September shooting that stunned the nation, a Tulsa police officer shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man. That same week, the shooting of armed black man Keith Lamont Scott sparked protests and rioting in Charlotte.

These cases followed a series of shocking deaths over the summer, particularly the shooting of Philando Castile as his girlfriend watched from the passenger seat.

Most recently, San Diego police killed an unarmed man—after his sister asked officers to help him because of his mental state.

We don’t know all the details of these cases. But we can still discuss how we should respond to them. Specifically: How should pro-life advocates respond to police brutality and growing frustrations in the African-American community?

When police brutality comes up in conversation, I’ve heard fellow pro-life advocates shift the dialogue to high abortion rates in the black community. “If black lives matter, why are you aborting your children?” they ask. Their underlying message: it’s hypocritical for the black community to care about those dying from police brutality and not for those in their community who choose abortion.

Meanwhile, I’ve read countless comments discussing police brutality, in which abortion statistics are brought up solely to suggest that there’s a bigger issue we should worry about. While it’s true that statistics show more black pre-born children die from abortion than black people die at the hands of the police, these are two separate issues. Both deserve attention without being pitted against each other.

Abortion deaths may be “bigger” in numbers, but this doesn’t negate the fact that any life lost through violence is a tragedy.

#BlackLivesMatter Should Be A Pro-Life Message

I remember when #BlackLivesMatter first began surfacing after the death of Trayvon Martin. When I saw the hashtag, it spoke a powerful truth to me. The message that black lives are valuable is one I identify with and believe in. I have worked more than a decade to show my people how high abortion rates have devastated our communities. I’ve educated others on the racist history of Planned Parenthood, revealing how founder Margaret Sanger aimed to decrease the black population.

Black Lives Matter activists communicated a truth I believed in—but for a different purpose. I felt conflicted, because I couldn’t reconcile our messages around a mutual desire to preserve life. I also grieved over the tragic deaths of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, and 12 year-old Tamir Rice, among others. At the same time, I grieved over the 16 million black children aborted since Roe v. Wade. It’s why I spent years praying at the Supreme Court for innocent lives. It’s why I serve in a local pregnancy resource center today.

I wanted to join these causes together. I longed for my black brothers and sisters to take to the streets in protest for the unborn, as well as for those harmed by police brutality. That desire to fight for life at every stage is good and right. But I fought a growing judgment towards those passionate over lives lost to police brutality, yet seemingly apathetic towards those lost to abortion.

Both Movements Seek to Protect Life

As the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement continued, I began to listen more attentively. Listening doesn’t mean I must agree with everything a person says or does. Listening is an act of love—an opportunity to be humble and hear the heart cry of another. As I listened to both friends and strangers, I heard stories of discrimination, decades of pain, and legitimate fears.

While listening, a thought came to me. I wanted my people, the black community, to hear my pain over children killed via abortion. But they wanted others to hear their pain over the loss of their sons and daughters via police brutality. That realization led me to understand, in a deeper way, that the black community is collectively in mourning.

This new empathy inspired me to commit to speaking with compassion and hope. I decided to look at police brutality and abortion as separate issues, both deserving of attention. I challenged myself to not interject abortion into the discussion of police brutality in ways that might accuse or shame the black community.

This does not mean I am unaware of the fact that Black Lives Matter as an organization supports abortion rights. BLM leaders partner with the pro-choice women of color organization Sister Song. This is one of many planks in the BLM platform that I clearly do not support.

How To Empathize With A Cause That’s Pro-Choice?

This puts me in an interesting place. How can I empathize with a movement that advocates for something I disagree with? I’ve found the best way to do this is to see the movement for what it is: a broad group of people with varying levels of involvement, all trying to raise awareness and fight the specific issue of police brutality.

The person who leads a BLM march and the teenager who tweets #BlackLivesMatter are different people with unique ambitions. But they both want to protect black lives. Black Lives Matter as an organization has initiatives and an agenda. By acknowledging black lives are important, I do not support every action members of the Black Lives Matter movement take.

Rather, I look at the people in BLM as individuals in a larger movement—and I show solidarity to them in their cause for justice. I do not agree with every tactic or protest on behalf of BLM. But I believe police brutality is real and should be addressed. I am glad BLM is having this dialogue and bringing it to the national stage. Perhaps through open lines of communication, we can all work together to bring positive change.

Pro-Lifers Shouldn’t Ignore Police Brutality

What does the mean on a practical level? For starters, I’ve come to believe that using certain questions as a knee-jerk response—“If black lives matter, then why are your abortion rates so high?”—is hurtful to the people I want to reach. It deflects from the issue BLM is fighting for. It suggests that if black people don’t care about unborn lives as much as adult lives, then they don’t care at all.

But many in the black community do care about the lives of the unborn as much as the lives of adults dying in the streets. Most of my black friends are staunchly pro-life. But they admit to feeling isolated among white pro-lifers when issues of race are discussed. Black leaders who’ve united with the pro-life movement are at times rejected and accused when they speak against racism. They are told to move past it, to “not see color,” to focus on more important issues like abortion (even when they already are) or “black on black” crime.

What about those who care about people dying from police brutality, but not from abortion? These are the people we pro-lifers must reach. Just as the BLM movement has rallied people, we as pro-life advocates can use our creativity, passion, and message to do the same. Instead of accusing the black community of not caring, let’s work to help more of them see abortion as a human rights issue worth caring about.

How do we bridge the divide? How do we all—regardless of race—stand for the pro-life message and communicate it to the black community with love?

Pro-Lifers Must Display Compassion and Care

First, we must seek to listen and care. We must refuse to use tools of shame, and instead uplift people with hope. Many black Americans already understand the issues that ravage our communities. They are not looking for a lecture. They are looking for compassionate people who will fight for change.

If we want others to listen to our concerns, we must listen to theirs as well.

I work with women daily who make decisions to parent, place their child up for adoption, or abort. I’ve never had an abortion-vulnerable woman talk about politics or race while making a pregnancy decision. Instead, these women share their financial issues, fear of abandonment, and need for practical resources.

Discussions of movements and politics definitely matter. And I’m not saying we should stop discussing abortion with the black community. These discussions are vital. But how we have these discussions, and when we have them, is important. If we want others to listen to our concerns, we must listen to theirs as well.

As the black community sees the pro-life movement act in caring, compassionate ways, they will understand that we care about the fate of their children. Black lives do matter—from the unborn child to the elderly. As pro-life advocates, we of all people should make that message clear.

You’ll Never Believe The Real Agenda Behind Anti-Police Agitators,"If you believe America’s police target black people for harsh treatment simply because of the color of their skin, then there is a good chance you have listened to Al Sharpton and his National Action Network and consider them credible observers of the country’s social scene. America’s newspapers and media routinely pass along Sharpton’s sentiments as though they represent reality.

But the Tawana Brawley affair, whose upcoming 30-year anniversary is next year, suggests the sentiments social justice activists represent aren’t so much the real issues blacks face in America, but rather artificial narrative-making.

On November 28, 1987, teenager Tawana Brawley was found in a trash bag with the words “n—-r” and “b—h” scrawled on her body in feces. She told the police who investigated her case that two white men had abducted her and dragged her into some woods, where they and four other white men brutalized and raped her for four days.

One of her attackers, she said, had blond hair, a holster, and a badge, and a second was Stephen Pagones, at the time a Dutchess County prosecutor. Bill Cosby and Spike Lee were among the celebrities who lined up behind Brawley, and Sharpton, at the time a still relatively unknown social justice activist, signed on as one of her advisers.

A grand jury that heard from 180 witnesses and met for seven months concluded in 1988 that the entire story was made up. As a result of the affair, Pagones’ marriage failed and he lost his job as a prosecutor. In 1998, he won a defamation lawsuit against Brawley and her advisers, including Sharpton. Johnnie Cochran and other benefactors paid the advisers’ share. Brawley, who today works under an assumed name at a retirement facility in Richmond, Virginia, is still paying her own share through wage garnishment. Neither Sharpton nor Brawley have ever apologized for the hoax.

Stage a Drama and Sell It as Real

American scholars have theorized about such narrative making and the organizations and leaders that carry it forward. These scholars include Robert D. Benford of the Sociology Department at the University of South Florida and William Gamson at Boston College. Gamson is also the co-director of the Media Research and Action Project, which advises social justice organizations on how to frame their arguments so that their audiences will find them persuasive.

Social movement organizations are organizations of power, Benford has written, and they communicate by interpreting grievance through drama, which includes roles and characterizations, performances, orchestrating emotions, sustaining tensions, and controlling information. He says their dramatic techniques include scripting scenes according to the collective consciousness, developing evocative vocabularies and dialogue, staging scenes, and interpreting the scenes, which includes controlling the meaning of symbols.

Activists appreciate the need for power, Benford says, and through drama socially aware actors can not only exercise the power they possess, but the power they are able to make others think that they possess.

In his classic “Encounters with Unjust Authority,” published in 1982, Gamson discusses the role of critical incidents, or crises, in collective action. Look for critical incidents, he says, because they can serve as a “red flag” to mobilize the public to a cause. A critical incident breaks the public away from society’s dominant belief system and inclines it instead toward the activists’ alternative vision. It also helps delegitimize established authority in favor of reformers’ authority, and transforms people from being simple observers to loyal and committed organization members.

Gamson also discusses what he and others have called the “Injustice Frame,” or an encounter with an authority wherein an advocacy organization contextualizes the competition as a grievance. In positing the “Injustice Frame” at the start of a critical incident, the social justice organization makes the frame’s tenets into reality: “When an injustice frame becomes the basis for collective action during an encounter,” he writes, “we have an opportunity to observe its spread and eventual adoption as it is happening.”

Tawana Brawley’s Successors

Time after time, the successors to the Tawana Brawley case have failed to describe what actually happened during the critical incidents they sensationalize, despite their success in mobilizing headlines and generating donations for their associated social movement organizations. These successors include Black Lives Matter, which has used these activist dramatic techniques, critical incidents, and injustice framing.

Michael Brown in Ferguson did not display “Hands up, don’t shoot;” the officers in Baltimore did not give Freddie Gray a ride that killed him; a New York City officer did not use an illegal chokehold to kill Eric Garner; Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte was carrying a gun, not a book.

In Chicago, where a white officer shot a black youth 16 times even as the teen lay motionless on the street and the event actually did constitute excessive force, organizers were uncharacteristically quiet. Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff of President Obama and ally of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was Chicago’s mayor, so he didn’t fit the description of an “unjust authority.”

Narrative-making in social affairs has high costs. Narratives from BLM and Sharpton trivialize real problems in the black community and distract from efforts to deal with them. The recent “Police War on Blacks” storyline caused local police departments to lose their autonomy to federal authorities, ruined the careers of good officers, inflamed tensions in police-community relations, and endangered poor communities by causing police to pull back.

Such costs are ultimately worth it, theorists and organization leaders will say. They think we are building the great progressive future where a compassionate and enlightened elite holds the reins of power in the United States. If in the process a few eggs are broken, it’s alright, because you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs.

Poll: Americans Are Not As Divided On Policing As Headlines Suggest,"Recent killings by police in Ferguson, New York City, Baltimore, Charlotte, Minneapolis, and other places have highlighted sharp disagreements among Americans about the current state of policing. Are police too quick to use deadly force? Is there a “war on police” preventing officers from keeping communities safe?

This debate has renewed focus on a deep racial divide in perceptions of how the police do their jobs. For instance, a Cato Institute/YouGov survey finds that 73 percent of African Americans and 54 percent of Hispanics believe police are “too quick” to use deadly force—compared to 35 percent of white Americans.

On the other hand, 64 percent of white Americans and 52 percent of Latinos worry there is a “war on police in America today,” but a majority (54 percent) of black Americans think there isn’t such a war.

There’s A Perception Gap—But Also Common Ground

This perception gap extends to nearly every evaluation of policing: responsiveness, accountability, professionalism, impartiality, and honesty. Overall, African Americans feel considerably less favorable (40 percent) toward the police than white Americans (68 percent), and Hispanics fall in between at 59 percent favorable.

Certainly, these perception gaps matter. But our political punditry has failed to notice the fact that Americans of all backgrounds largely agree about how policing should operate in America.

A Cato Institute/YouGov national survey that I conducted finds that while Americans have different perceptions of how police operate, no demographic group is “anti-cop.” Americans agree on what we want from our police, and reach consensus on a variety of police reforms.

Media have sensationalized the extreme fringes of activists, who call for “abolishing” or “defunding” the police. But these individuals are rare and do not represent the views of many people. For instance, nine in 10 black, white, and Hispanic Americans all oppose reducing the number of police officers in their community—and a third say their community needs more officers.

Furthermore, very few people even go so far as to say they have “very unfavorable” views of the police (one in 10 or less of any racial group). In addition, six in 10 black, Hispanic, and white Americans all believe that police have very dangerous jobs—suggesting empathy for police officers and the risks they face.

Police Should Fight Violent Crime, Not the Drug War

Americans also agree on how police should prioritize their tasks: prioritize fighting violent crime, not the drug war.

When asked to select their top three priorities for law enforcement, Americans want police to prioritize investigating violent crime (78 percent), protecting people from crime (64 percent), and investigating robberies and property crime (58 percent). Blacks, whites, and Hispanics share these top three priorities for the police.

Notably, only 30 percent of Americans say enforcing drug laws should be a top police priority. And perhaps ironically, only 19 percent think the police should prioritize traffic enforcement—the task leading to the most common interaction we have with the police, getting a traffic ticket.

No One Likes Civil Asset Forfeiture

Eighty-four percent (84 percent) of Americans solidly oppose civil asset forfeiture—a practice in which police may take the money or property of a person suspected to have been involved in a crime before the person is convicted. Virtually all demographic groups—including 84 percent of whites, 86 percent of blacks, and 80 percent of Hispanics—oppose civil asset forfeiture. Why does it persist? Probably because people don’t know what it is or can’t believe that it actually occurs.

Support For Independent Investigations and Body Cameras

Although whites (57 percent), blacks (36 percent), and Hispanics (49 percent) disagree about whether police are held accountable for misconduct in practice, strong majorities of all three groups support reforms intended to enhance accountability.

For instance, 79 percent of Americans support having outside law enforcement agencies investigate police misconduct, rather than leave it to the department to handle in-house (21 percent). Although most jurisdictions allow police departments to internally investigate and discipline their own officers, majorities of Americans regardless of race or ethnicity think independent investigations would better enhance police accountability.

Americans of all racial backgrounds also agree that on-duty police should wear body cameras to record their interactions with citizens, with 89 percent in support. People think body cameras can help keep both citizens and police accountable by protecting the police from false accusations and keeping police honest by recording their on-duty interactions.

A Majority Support De-escalation Training for Police

Americans disagree about whether police tactics are “too harsh.” Fifty-six percent of African Americans think tactics are too harsh, but 67 percent of whites and 58 percent of Hispanics think they’re “about right.”

However, Americans of all racial backgrounds agree police could do more to de-escalate confrontations with citizens and could benefit from additional training (68 percent). Such a reform is broadly popular with solid majorities of whites (62 percent), Latinos (78 percent), and blacks (82 percent) all in support of providing police officers with additional confrontation training.

Americans Want Police to Be Transparent

The survey found that Americans also want police to be transparent about stops and searches. Most jurisdictions in the U.S. don’t require police officers to inform citizens when a police stop and search is voluntary or mandatory. However, a strong majority of Americans (73 percent) think police should notify citizens when a stop is voluntary and they may decline to be searched. Even though most Americans have nothing to hide, many may resist added scrutiny from police or government when given the choice.

Americans Support Cooling the Drug War

The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports police make about 1.6 million drug arrests every year. Thus, many criminal justice scholars believe that cooling the drug war could go a long way to improve police-community relations by reducing the opportunities people have to interact with police. Plus doing so could free up resources to help police fight violent crime.

Sure, few people want to outright legalize all drugs. But the survey found a majority of Americans also don’t think we should punish drug offenses like we would a criminal offense. Instead, 54 percent believe we should treat drug offenses like minor traffic violations with small fines rather than as felonies. Re-categorizing drug offenses from felonies to civil offenses is broadly popular regardless of racial or ethnic background (whites at 54 percent, blacks at 59 percent, and Hispanics at 52 percent).

We’re More United Than We Are Divided

When it comes to what we want from police and how to improve policing, Americans are far more united than we are divided. It’s simply not controversial to suggest police should be transparent, wear body cameras, receive de-escalation training, or only take a person’s stuff after they’ve been convicted of a crime.

Furthermore, these data show that we don’t all have to agree about the source of every policing problem in order to support criminal justice reform. Despite different perceptions of how the police actually do their jobs, Americans reach consensus about how police should do their jobs. Furthermore, Americans of all backgrounds support a variety of reforms that many criminal justice scholars believe can help keep police safe and mend relationships between police and the communities they serve.

"If College Students Will Protest Mike Huckabee, They’ll Protest Anybody","A few days ago, a group of students at John Brown University protested former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee’s chapel talk on civic engagement. By all accounts, everything went fine. Protesters stood along the wall of the school’s Cathedral of the Ozarks wearing bright white T-shirts with slogans such as “minority rights are human rights.”

Afterward, there was a Q&A session where I understand Huckabee acquitted himself well, which is what you would expect given his vast experience in politics and the media.

But the question that nags at me is this: Is Mike Huckabee really protest-worthy? I want to be clear that I am not arguing to shut down protests or inhibit disagreement, but I do want to challenge the students and those who may have encouraged them. Does Huckabee really live up to the ugly billing he received from protesters?

Let’s Ask a Few Basic Questions

In justification of their protest, students associated their state’s former governor and two-time presidential candidate with racism, sexual violence against women, police brutality, and various other unacceptable positions. So I thought about Huckabee and asked myself a few questions.

Does he argue for the supremacy of a particular race, for the inferiority of a particular race, or for giving different rights to different races?

Does he argue that women should suffer sexual violence at the hands of men, or commit such violence himself?

Does he argue that police brutality is a good thing? Does he try to do away with investigative processes established to determine fault in the area of police brutality? Does he think there should be no accountability for police officers?

Now, let’s consider whether these questions have answers. It seems to me that Huckabee would say he does not endorse racism, embraces an ethic of sexuality that would preclude violence, and believes that police power can be abused because human beings are sinful. What you will really find, then, is that something more like the following is happening.

He explicitly argues against racial supremacy and discrimination, but disagrees with various legal remedies proposed to address racial inequality (such as affirmative action). The way the game is played, Huckabee is now a racist.

He does not argue for sexual violence against women and is not known to commit such acts. However, he supported Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy. If that choice establishes him as a supporter of sexual violence against women, then I suppose people who supported President Clinton were proponents of intern seduction. (See, the logic gets a little funny.) The reality is that we live in a largely binary system, and a person may have voted for Trump because she did not support Hillary Clinton.

Huckabee does not embrace police brutality. Most likely, he has looked at an incident where police brutality was charged and came to a different conclusion than others regarding the guilt of the officer involved.

You will notice that the examples here are all instances of left-wing political sensibilities being used to make someone (in this case Huckabee) radioactive (a racist!) when in fact they simply disagree with proposed solutions for addressing a particular issue. However, I would be wrong not to admit that the same thing happens in the opposite direction. Here is an example:

Assertion: “Left-wing politician X is an anti-Semite.”

Question: “Why is politician X an anti-Semite?”

Response: “He believes the Palestinians should have more rights to territory occupied by Israel than I do.”

What can we conclude? Politician X may be an anti-Semite (who knows but God, who sees hearts?), but not because of his position on this particular policy. His chosen policy simply indicates that he believes the Palestinians have a stronger claim than do those who favor the government of Israel.

Use Your Freedoms Well, Not Stupidly

After taking the time to explain this unhappy political phenomenon of bootstrapping disagreement with a right- or left-wing agenda into RACISM, SEXISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, etc., what we should do about it? If we choose to protest with as light a provocation as someone such as Huckabee provides (students pointed to his Twitter feed), then life will become miserably dominated by ideology.

Let me give an example. A few years ago, my school (Union University), which is Christian and leans conservative, invited Paul Begala to campus for a talk. Begala was an advisor to candidate and President Bill Clinton, and has been a longtime liberal media presence.

Now, many of us at Union highly oppose abortion. I have written against abortion many times over the years. One path would have been for me to encourage my students to make signs and T-shirts and march around the speaking venue denouncing Begala and his pro-choice ways. We could have stood around the edges of the room casting a pall over his talk with our attention-getting signs and shirts.

But we didn’t. Instead, Begala gave his talk in a winsome fashion, and it was well-received. Many in the audience surely disagreed with a variety of Begala’s positions, but the event was a positive part of university life. In large part, it succeeded because of the civility of the people involved: administration, professors, Begala, and students.

I don’t want to be heard arguing against the value of protest. Protest is an important part of life together in a free country, but freedom also requires virtue. Two of those virtues are civility and hospitality. Protest should be a live option. But it should also be one that is probably used with more provocation than Mike Huckabee’s Twitter feed, lest it become smothering in frequency and trivial in nature.

How Federal Spending Fuels The Campus Speech Police,"Donald Trump famously tweeted a question of whether campuses that don’t protect free speech should lose federal funding, after aggressive protesters prevented flamboyant conservative speaker (and Trump promoter) Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the University of California at Berkeley earlier this year.

Earlier this month, off-campus rioters used a peaceful protest by UC-Berkeley students to set fire to university property. The next day, a group of students and faculty at New York University protested another conservative speaker, Gavin McInnes. Last week the student government at Santa Clara University banned a local chapter of Turning Point USA, a group that advocates “fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government,” reportedly claiming that such beliefs and discussions were in themselves racist and made liberal students uncomfortable.

While everyone is blaming everything from bureaucracy to culture, few are laying blame on what may be the core culprit: generous federal funding for universities. Critics say the explosive growth of federal higher education funding has fueled tuition hikes and expensive property developments like palatial conference centers and spa-quality gymnasiums, but it may also threaten free speech on campus.

Almost three million of the 13 million undergraduate students in the United States could be hearing their fellow students talk about “Bert” this year. But they won’t be talking about Bert of Bert and Ernie, or any other Bert they’ve met. They’ll be talking about “BRTS,” Bias Report Teams, a new collegiate institution now found on about 232 campuses that serve those 3 million students.

A new report on free speech on American campuses tabulates and surveys the rise of Bias Response Teams. While colleges and their surrounding communities have long had mechanisms for addressing hate crimes, BRTs address the subtle slights and micro-aggressions—whether intentional or unintentional—that some people say makes them feel unsafe. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education report also found that 42 percent of BRTs include law enforcement personnel, what FIRE called “literal speech police.”

What the ‘Literal Speech Police’ Do

The BRT at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York deemed the message “Make America Great Again” written on the whiteboards of two female faculty members of color as a “racial attack.” Pro-Trump messages written in chalk at the Emory University in Atlanta and the University of Michigan also prompted school-wide investigations.

BRT officials at the University of Oregon spoke with staff members of the campus newspaper in response to an anonymous complaint alleging it lacked coverage of transgender people. A BRT warned Mike Jensen, an adjunct professor at the University of Northern Colorado, “not to revisit transgender issues in his classroom” after a student complained about his question “If somebody has never been a woman, how can they know they feel like a woman?”

“Inviting students to report a broad range of speech to campus authorities casts a chilling pall over free speech rights,” Adam Steinbaugh, a FIRE senior program officer, said in a statement. “Bias response teams solicit reports of a wide range of constitutionally protected speech, including speech about politics and social issues. These sometimes anonymous bias reports can result in interventions by conflict-wary administrators who then provide ‘education,’ often in the form of a verbal reprimand, or even explicit punishment.”

Martin Berger, a vice provost at the University of California–Santa Cruz, says BRTs are necessary. “For many years, bias reports, if they were dealt with at all, were handled haphazardly. Campuses in recent years have sought to build multi-disciplinary teams capable of handling any incident that arises.” Berger says there were hundreds of reports last year at UC Santa Cruz, though he doesn’t know exactly how many.

Federal Funds Fuel the Speech Police

BRTs are mainly staffed by deans, administrators, and campus staff borrowed from diversity, student life, LGBT, and discrimination offices, says Steinbaugh. Just as these bureaucracies once did not have their own separately funded staff and offices, separately funded BRTs may be the next bureaucracy to sprout under the rain of federal funding. Even the University of Chicago, whose provost famously issued a statement against restrictive campus speech codes in 2016, has a Bias Report Team.

I interviewed Carleton College professor Jeffrey Snyder, because he’d written for The New Republic last year on the chilling effect of BRTs on free speech. In a lengthy and cordial conversation Wednesday morning, I asked about the irony of the University of Chicago promulgating the “Chicago Statement” while having a BRT. He agreed, but said it was part of a more general problem where administration and faculty are often at cross purposes.

This observation raises the question of whether government funding doesn’t tend to expand the administrative bureaucracy and its power relative to that of faculty, and shift the mission of schools away from teaching. When Snyder surveyed existing BRTs one year ago, he found only 100. This year the FIRE report finds over twice as many. Steinbaugh says that although the number of BRTs is growing, he doubts it doubled in one year, and suspects Snyder used a different survey method (Steinbaugh surveyed 500).

Curiously, a day and a half later Snyder sent me an email saying I could not quote him if I were writing an article for Breitbart, where I have written in the past. That’s why here I’m paraphrasing him. I reiterated I was writing a short newsy piece on the FIRE report for my own employer, the American Media Institute Newswire, then a longer article for something like The Hill or The Federalist.

I then sent him a rough draft of this article so he could see his quotes in context. I told him if for any reason I wrote about this topic for Breitbart I’d leave his quotes out. Several hours later, despite having gone on the record initially, Snyder decided he did not want to be quoted, period. Apparently it’s dangerous to be an academic quoted in non-Left venues.

Why Does Anyone Think Thought Police Are Worthwhile?

Trying to find proponents of Bias Report Teams who will discuss them can be difficult. Two days spent emailing and calling Dr. Archie Ervin, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, finally resulted in his secretary reporting that he said he was getting ready for a trip and could not talk.

Reaching those in charge of bias reports at the University of Chicago was similarly difficult. The phone number used to make a Bias Report asks the caller to choose from a menu, including being connected to the police or to the “Dean on Call.” The latter option leads to a beeping voicemail box with no greeting or other message. One University of Chicago dean’s office referred me to an employee, Lynda Daher, in a student affairs office with an LGBT portfolio who is still listed on the university website, but when called turns out to have left the university’s employ the year previously.

Punishing ‘hazing’ means punishing actions, not protected speech or beliefs. It is not a tool of re-education to eliminate wrong thoughts.

Dozens of email queries to campus BRT offices around the country and to a variety of civil rights groups—the NAACP, Human Rights Campaign, American Association of University Women, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force—produced only one response, from the earlier quoted Berger. Berger says FIRE is wrong to be concerned that police officers are on many BRTs: “They seem concerned that 42 percent of bias teams contain members of law enforcement. They apparently take this as a sign that police are used to suppress free speech… Campuses in recent years have sought to build multi-disciplinary teams capable of handling any incident that arises.”

But lumping “any incident” reported as “bias” seems to be exactly the problem: having a belief, stating a belief, and other forms of protected speech, are lumped together with violence, threats, and intimidation. Much of what many people would now view as “bias” that should be punished on campus was in previous decades simply considered “hazing.” A few university BRTs, including George Washington University and the University of Virginia, do actually also refer to the older concept of “hazing.”

But punishing “hazing” means punishing actions, not protected speech or beliefs. It is not a tool of re-education to eliminate wrong thoughts. Under the BRT regime, the fact that someone reported a student or faculty member for having or stating an opinion that made the reporter uncomfortable might be filed as a harassment claim in that person’s permanent record, for all future employers or graduate schools to see.

BRTs Have It Out for Everyone

Steinbaugh (and Snyder) point out that although reports on campus censorship largely show discrimination against conservative and libertarian groups, students on both sides of political issues use them. That includes white students who claim they are offended by Black Lives Matter-style protests or lecturers claiming policing in America targets blacks, by conservative students claiming they are offended by progressive groups calling Donald Trump a racist, and even by progressive and minority students squabbling among themselves.

According to FIRE, only half of the BRTs surveyed said they believed there is a tension between free speech and combatting bias.

In a 2015 incident FIRE founder Greg Lukianoff discussed in a coauthored article for The Atlantic, a group of Asian students at Brandeis University placed an installation on campus attempting to raise awareness about smaller, unintended slights referred to as “micro-aggressions”—things like being asked “Where did your family come from?” or “What was your first language?”—only to have it shut down by other students claiming that the installation itself was a microaggression.

According to FIRE, only half of the BRTs surveyed said they believed there is a tension between free speech and combatting bias. Almost half involved law enforcement officials in their bias reports. Steinbaugh said he thinks the growth of BRTs results more from campus administrative bureaucrats importing harassment reporting and counseling practices from HR departments than from ideas about taking power from or censoring privileged groups and empowering minorities derived from academics like Herbert Marcuse or Eve Kosofsky Sedgewick. That would mean this problem also stems from the growth in regulations at all levels of government and the American propensity for frequent litigation.

If President Trump and the GOP decide to reign in federal spending on post-secondary education, especially outside of the sciences, highlighting the institutionalization of censorship on campus may give them plenty of talking points and anecdotes that will resonate with the voters who elected them.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/14/federal-spending-fuels-campus-speech-police/,2017-02-14
This One Simple Change To Traffic Laws Can Reduce Police Brutality,"Think of the last time you had to interact with a police officer. Chances are, it was a traffic stop. Most Americans drive, and in a country where it’s nearly impossible not to violate some criminal law while behind the wheel, to drive is literally to be a criminal. Being a criminal means the cops can stop and arrest you at any time, even to investigate a crime that has nothing to do with any traffic violation.

That’s not a big deal for most people, since they know the rare traffic ticket is probably the worst that can happen. But when getting pulled over can mean violence or even death, the prospect of a traffic stop can be a constant menace.

As anyone who isn’t willfully ignorant knows, that’s the reality facing many black (and brown) Americans today. Poverty dynamics, implicit bias, and a judiciary that has interpreted the Fourth Amendment to place few limits on police discretion all combine to create an environment in which police-related violence has become unacceptably commonplace.

Decriminalize Traffic Offenses

That needs to end. Improvements like body cameras and independent police auditors are steps in the right direction, but none of those reforms gets at the source of the problem, which is that our criminal traffic laws give police officers the discretion to detain a broad swath of the country’s population at will in the unceasing effort to nab more criminals.

The time has long since come to attack this systemic defect at its root. That means abolishing our criminal traffic laws and replacing them with an administrative enforcement system.

We’ve come to take it for granted, but it’s actually bizarre that we use police officers and criminal courts to enforce basic traffic regulations. In every other similar context — fire codes, building standards, occupational rules, and a host of others — we use administrative systems to enforce society’s health and safety standards, not criminal laws and criminal law enforcement. Yet we’re no less safe as a result.

The difference is important. Unlike police officers, administrative personnel don’t investigate crimes and aren’t empowered to arrest or detain. So, for example, when a contractor doesn’t construct a building with access to a fire escape, or a restaurant owner doesn’t require her employees to wash their hands, they aren’t arrested or put in jail by a police officer. A code enforcement official just issues them a citation or an order to correct the violation.

There’s no reason it should be any different when dealing with turn signals and speed limits rather than building construction and sanitation. Except for serious offenses like drunk or reckless driving (which should remain criminal laws), traffic violations don’t pose an imminent danger to safety.

The guy who doesn’t use his signal before changing lanes may be annoying, even incautious. But no one’s going to be hurt if he’s merely fined rather than detained by a police officer the moment he commits his transgression. Just as with any other regulatory scheme, we can rely on administrative enforcement rather than the criminal justice system to deter everyday bad driving and keep us safe.

Traffic Stops Are Not about Deterrence

One reason we’ve gotten so accustomed to our criminal regime is that a traffic stop lets a police officer cite the actual driver who commits a violation, whereas in an administrative system enforcement officials would likely just send the car’s registered owner a fine by mail. We already enforce parking laws this way, and it makes sense. The theory is that a car’s owner is responsible for making sure his car is used properly, even if he permits other people to use it. That theory applies equally in the context of minor traffic violations.

But even if we wanted to preserve the practice of on-the-spot vehicle stops, enforcement officers in an administrative system would have no criminal investigative authority, so the stop would consist of nothing more than citing and releasing the offending driver. This type of strictly non-criminal, citation-only system is very different from the world of traffic cops and criminal courts we’ve always known, and the shift from one to the other could be jarring for some.

But we can’t continue to abide the status quo. Police officers should fight crime, not supervise driving. Ending the practice of using armed police officers to stop drivers based on minor traffic violations would do nothing to impair criminal law enforcement. Quite the opposite—it would free our officers to focus on protecting us from real crime, not to mention lighten the burden on our overworked courts. At the same time, that single reform would do more than any other to reduce unnecessary police-related violence.

Let’s stop accepting that people suffering or dying because of minor traffic violations is inevitable. It isn’t. People only suffer or die because we have elected to use criminal laws to regulate an innocuous everyday activity. Abolishing those laws and replacing them with a simple administrative system is the first necessary step to fixing the problem.

We owe it to our fellow citizens, especially our citizens of color, to do that (rather than the opposite) before yet another person is needlessly jailed, assaulted, or killed simply because she had the audacity to get behind the wheel of a car.

What I Learned About Civil Unrest During The Los Angeles Riots,"The age of cell phone video ubiquity treats us with daily outrages over people in authority behaving badly towards the powerless. Unreasoned passion leads to a thirst for justice, or at least the appearance of justice.

In 1991, there were no cell-phone cameras and the Internet was still in its infancy. In March of that year, after a high-speed chase through the night, Los Angeles Police Department officers arrested Rodney King. King was intoxicated. He later admitted that he tried to evade the police because a DUI charge would violate his parole conditions for a prior robbery conviction.

King’s arrest turned ugly as four uniformed LAPD officers swarmed the resisting suspect, tasered him, beat him with batons, and kicked him. A citizen videotaped the latter part of the arrest from his apartment window and that footage eventually made its way onto the L.A. nightly news, then around the world.

So it was that on May 1, 1992, I was an Army National Guard captain leading my first patrol with live ammunition in a real-world mission. Operation Garden Plot wasn’t a training exercise, it was a large-scale effort to restore order to riot-torn Los Angeles.

Smoke hung in the air. It was an acrid haze—smoldering cars have a distinct smell. Behind me were seven National Guardsmen armed with automatic rifles. In addition to my M16, I carried two tear gas grenades, as did most commissioned officers. Our numbers included a Vietnam veteran who grew up in the largely black neighborhood. Given the racial unrest at the heart of the L.A. riots, I took point and placed him second in our file.

As soon as our foot patrol left the relative safety of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza parking structure and hit Crenshaw Boulevard, with West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to our backs, the Vietnam veteran locked and loaded. In rapid succession, six bolts slapped forward, chambering rounds.

Our rules of engagement forbade a round in the chamber unless we were threatened. I stopped and addressed the soldiers, trying to sound low-key: “Take the rounds out of your chambers. This is America, not Lebanon. If someone takes me out, you’ll have plenty of time to lock and load and return fire.” I smiled. Soldiers reluctantly tugged at their charging handles, removing the chambered rounds and placing in the other 20-round magazine they carried.

From Home to a Domestic War Zone

Some 48 hours earlier, I had been in a windowless office working on a classified missile defense program for Lockheed in San Jose, 400 miles to the north. My wife and infant daughter had traveled with me and were staying at a hotel a few miles away. Unknown to any of us at the time, in the days when mobile phones were as large as shoe boxes, at 3:15 p.m., April 29, 1992, a California jury acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers of the charge of using excessive force in King’s arrest the year before.

A little more than two hours later, a rioter attacked a driver at Florence and Normandie in what was then known as South Central L.A. (the 51-square-mile region of 25 neighborhoods was officially rebranded simply “South Los Angeles” in 2003). LAPD officers responded, but then retreated at mob opposition. They wouldn’t come back to try to restore order for almost three hours.

Abandoned to rioters, the busy intersection turned into a gauntlet. At 6:45 p.m. Reginald Denny, clueless about the spiraling violence, entered the intersection in his gravel truck. Rioters stopped his truck, quickly dragged him from his cab, and started to beat him with a brick, a large fire extinguisher, and a tire iron. Denny was on the verge of death when four people, two men and two women, interceded, shielding him from further harm. They mounted the truck and drove it haltingly out of the riot zone.

Two hours later, L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley declared a state of emergency, triggering Gov. Pete Wilson to call up 2,000 National Guard soldiers. The nightly news in the Bay Area made it appear that the unrest in L.A. was highly localized and likely to fade away as law enforcement reasserted itself. I called my National Guard armory in National City just south of San Diego and was told that, while we hadn’t been activated yet, we could be.

Just past midnight, Mayor Bradley declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the parts of L.A. most affected by the riots. Early next morning the violence subsided, leading many to think the situation was coming under control. But the rioters were merely sleeping in. Rioting and looting is primarily a nocturnal activity, giving the unrest a battle rhythm: cool in the morning, hot at night.

I drove to the classified vault on the Lockheed campus. By lunchtime, a co-worker called my attention to a wall-mounted TV that had just been switched on. Los Angeles was on fire. “Aren’t you in the National Guard?” he asked. There were images from a news helicopter of hundreds of looters smashing storefronts and emerging with video cameras, shoes, TVs, stereos.

I gathered up my wife and our baby and made it to the airport. Our armor battalion still hadn’t been called up yet, but it was obvious that we would be. By late afternoon, we were in the air over Los Angeles. A dozen columns of inky smoke made their way high into the reddening sky as we approached John Wayne Airport in Orange County.

I grabbed my gear and drove to join my unit, which I learned was forming up at an armory in Long Beach, a few miles south of the rioting.

Our First Two Altercations

Early in the morning on May 1, we convoyed to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza at the corner of Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The parking garage would be our base for the next few days. The sight of burning retail buildings assaulted our senses as we made our way to Crenshaw, no firefighters in sight. Knots of looters ignored us as we rumbled by in our ancient deuce-and-a-half trucks and Humvees.

After coordinating with the local LAPD unit, we began sending out patrols. Burning cars littered the neighborhood. Looters stole cars, using them as giant battering rams to break into liquor stores and other retail shops with high-value items. Overwhelmed firefighters came under gunfire as they responded, necessitating armed escort.

As we patrolled, residents routinely called out, “God Bless the National Guard!” By noon, however, gang members had started to make their appearance and the mood grew tense. They flashed gang signs and glared at our soldiers, hurdling the occasional insult. Around 4 p.m. at our battalion headquarters in the parking garage, the back passenger window of a journalist’s car suddenly shattered about 30 feet away. Assessing the field of view, we figured it was likely from a stray bullet rather than an aimed sniper shot.

At midnight, I led my second foot patrol out of the parking structure. We aimed for what the LAPD called “The Jungle,” the frequently violent fault line of two gang territories, one Mexican-American, the other African-American. We soon heard what sounded like a woman in distress and jogged over to investigate, soldiers about 10 yards apart in a wedge formation.

It was a domestic dispute taking place under street lights, smoke wafting through the air. On one end of the block stood a woman yelling, “I’m going to kill him!” At the other end of the block was a visibly drunken man holding a paper bag. Turning first to the woman, I said, “Ma’am, there’s a curfew. You have to go home.”

She turned to me with anger then saw that I held a bayonet-tipped rifle and was wearing body armor. I wasn’t the cop she expected. She opened her eyes wide, and was silent for a moment before turning back to the object of her fury. “I’ll kill him!” she said, shaking her fist at the man.

Our actions were intently watched from several windows in an apartment building that ran along the block.

I dispatched a soldier to escort the woman home. She left reluctantly, looking over her shoulder at the man. Turning to the man, I asked him to go home. “But she’ll kill me!” he slurred thickly. We moved to escort him home. “Can I kill this?” he asked, as he swirled the brown paper bag holding the bottle of liquor.

“Do you really think that’s a good idea?” I replied. He looked at me, looked at his bottle, then poured the rest of the whiskey down the storm drain and steeled himself for his fate as we escorted him home. Our actions were intently watched from several windows in an apartment building that ran along the block.

The final patrol that night could have been tragic. Because of the curfew, we saw few vehicles after sunset, and most of those belonged to law enforcement. Then a black car slowly rolled towards us. As the car approached, I could see it had chrome rims. It looked like a gangster’s ride. The tinted windows were half-open. I ordered the squad to form an “L” at the intersection to optimize our firepower and flexibility. We expected a drive-by shooting attempt.

I bellowed, “Halt! There’s a curfew. What’s your business?”

The car stopped with frenzied activity inside made barely visible by the streetlights and confirmed by the car’s rocking. The driver’s side window came down all the way and a cracking voice yelled out, “LAPD vice squad!” The driver stuck his police badge out the window.

I was dumbfounded. The wisdom of sending the vice squad out in an unmarked car—and a tricked-out one at that—as fires still raged and nervous guardsmen patrolled unfamiliar streets was highly questionable.

The U.S. Marines Arrive

By May 2, many Guard soldiers had been awake for more than 36 hours, trying mightily to restore order to Los Angeles and succeeding. Probably due to dueling political rivalries and concerns for upcoming elections, the interplay between the mayor, the governor, and the president resulted in the decision to deploy active-duty soldiers and Marines into Los Angeles.

When we found out that the Seventh Infantry Division commander would take command of Army National Guard troops—soldiers who had brought order to chaos—our morale crashed. Our view on the ground was that there was no need for the active-duty to save the day. Within a few hours the commanding general of the Seventh Infantry Division assumed command of the joint Army-Marine Corps force. He then placed the National Guard commanding general over all Army forces, both Guard and active-duty. With honor restored, our morale largely recovered.

We also mostly ignored the order because, if followed to the letter, it would have relegated our troops to the status of armed statues.

Another challenge quickly arose when the Seventh Infantry Division’s military lawyers (JAGs) believed that the Guard’s federalization compelled it to act within the Posse Comitatus Act. The joint force commander immediately ordered our close cooperation with the LAPD scaled back. We were incredulous. We also mostly ignored the order because, if followed to the letter, it would have relegated our troops to the status of armed statues.

National Guard members usually operate under control of their respective governors in peacetime, thus, the Posse Comitatus Act restrictions against federal troops assisting in civilian law enforcement duties doesn’t apply. In fact, the federalization of the Guard troops would have caused Posse Comitatus to come into effect except for the fact that when President Bush signed Executive Order 12804 on May 1, invoking the Insurrection Act, he authorized the Army and Marines, as well as the federalized National Guard, to enforce civilian law to help restore law and order.

This was in accord with Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 of the Constitution, the “Militia Clause” which allows the militia’s use to “…suppress Insurrections…” The Seventh Infantry Division’s JAGs erred.

From the beginning of the riots, patrols found flyers calling for ‘insurrection’ and exhorting violence against law enforcement.

By May 3, soldiers and Marines were taking a lower profile. Rumors proliferated that we had no ammunition or weren’t allowed to shoot. Gang members were getting more aggressive, and wanted their turf back. Mayor Bradley indicated his intent to lift the curfew on May 4, and we were worried about maintaining order without a curfew.

That night, however, a young man tried to run over a team of Guardsmen at a checkpoint. He missed twice, scattering the citizen-soldiers, and was coming in on his third pass when the soldiers fired on the onrushing car, aiming for the tires first, then, when the car came on, at the driver. They struck him twice, once in the shoulder and once in the head, killing him at the scene. Police later determined the driver was trying to earn initiation into a street gang.

With the military on L.A.’s streets now shown to have a deadly sting, May 4 opened with newly docile gang members. Mayor Bradley lifted the curfew as planned and the night was quiet.

From the beginning of the riots, patrols found flyers calling for “insurrection” and exhorting violence against law enforcement. Communist organizations and gangs authored the flyers. Given the Cold War had ended with Soviet communism’s defeat only two-and-a-half years before, it seemed the American communists didn’t get the memo.

Aftermath of the Riots and Lessons Learned

The 1992 L.A. riots claimed the lives of 53 people—19 more than died in the 1965 Watts Riots. There were no deaths during the unrest in Ferguson or Baltimore in 2014 and 2015. During the far less destructive Watts Riots, the National Guard expended a large amount of ammunition, including .50 caliber heavy machine gun rounds. This level of force in an American city was unacceptable. In the 1992 riots, the National Guard fired 20 rounds, signaling a high level of training and leadership.

The last 25 years of urban unrest in America, and around the world, show how rapidly domestic tranquility can collapse when law enforcement steps aside or is overwhelmed. Further, once anarchy overcomes order, it can take a major effort to restore public peace.

This was the case in L.A. when police abandoned the intersection of Florence and Normandie to rioters, turning a local incident into a regional conflagration in 24 hours. This is the case today whenever police stand by and allow fringe groups to battle each other in our streets and on our campuses, catching up innocent people in the violence and allowing the destruction of private property—and, frequently abridging the First Amendment rights of non-liberal speakers.

The last 25 years of urban unrest in America, and around the world, show how rapidly domestic tranquility can collapse when law enforcement steps aside.

Cities that have experienced violent unrest often feature police departments that do not have the trust of the people they serve. The visceral reaction to the excessive force used in the Rodney King arrest didn’t happen in a vacuum. It spoke to deeply held public feelings about police behavior. Similarly, in Ferguson, Missouri, the police department had been enlisted by city government as a revenue tool, collecting arcane fines and fees from the residents under the threat of arrest for nonpayment. This practice severely corroded community-police relations.

In Los Angeles, the law enforcement environment was further compounded by the fact that 1992 was the worst year for violent crime in the region’s history, with a record 2,589 homicides occurring in Los Angeles County, compared to 649 in 2015. Rampant lawlessness made it far more difficult for police to do their jobs.

Lastly, it is instructive to note that during every significant episode of urban unrest there is a cadre of professional agitators in the shadows urging people on to violence and revolution. In 1992, they had no apparent success, although not for the want of trying. With the weaponization of social media by terrorist groups, it is likely that domestic radicals have had some recent effect in deepening and prolonging unrest.

Three months after a state jury’s acquittal of four LAPD officers led to the deadly L.A. riots, a federal grand jury indicted the same men on charges of violating King’s civil rights. A year later, a federal judge sentenced two of those officers to prison for two-and-a-half years.

While the judge acknowledged the appearance of a double jeopardy prosecution—the officers were convicted of civil rights violations, not use of excessive force of which they were acquitted—the rule of law prevailed. Holding our government, including our police, accountable can be a step toward healing the divisions that can develop in any community.

How Expecting Police To Be All Things To All People Can Fuel Violence,"Fifty-two years ago, in Watts, California, two officers pulled over a black motorist who they believed to be drunk. A scuffle began, and things turned violent. By the time the violence ebbed, 34 people had been killed, and $40 million worth of damage had been done.

Twenty-five years ago, the story seemed to repeat itself: another drunk driver, another police beating, another race riot in southern Los Angeles that claimed dozens of lives and left neighborhoods smoldering.

If riots were earthquakes, LA would be due for another. A recent poll suggests that Angelenos are bracing for exactly that. A quarter-century after Rodney King, these stories still feel uncomfortably contemporary. Race riots are back, and policing is still the main fuse. Over the past three years, violent demonstrations have hit Ferguson, Charlotte, Milwaukee, and other cities, even as homicide and gang violence become more prevalent across multiple American cities. We’re feeling the tremors. Is a major quake on the way?

We Have To Think About Our Expectations For Police

In a way, it’s maddening to find ourselves comparing riots to earthquakes. Humans, after all, are not tectonic plates. We have agency. No one benefits from a quadricentennial torching of civilized society. So can’t we just find a way to get along?

Reflecting on this sad state of affairs may tempt us to think in cosmic terms, viewing racial unrest as a fixed feature of our national character, perhaps derived from America’s Original Sin or deep-seated tribal loyalties. A finer-grained analysis may yield a less bleak (if more prosaic) diagnosis. It’s possible to keep order without creating unrest. The past few decades have in fact seen some remarkable innovations in crime control. If we can develop and implement them properly, it should be possible to maintain civic order without sacrificing Constitutional rights.

We may need to think more carefully, however, about deep tensions in the expectations we place on police officers.

The Man Who Professionalized Policing

Fundamentally, we want officers of the law to be three things: warriors, community workers, and sleuths. Fight crime, serve the public, and crack the case. These functions are not mutually exclusive, but choosing the right hat for the right situation can be a scramble. A mindset that supports one of these functions may not be optimal for another.

The King riots drew the nation’s attention to the shortcomings of a “warrior”-oriented model of policing. For decades before the fateful Simi Valley verdict, however, the LAPD had been the nation’s leading model of “professionalized policing.”

When the legendary Bill Parker took over the LAPD in 1950, he immediately began applying his experience as a decorated World War II veteran. Effectively, he made his police force into a kind of domestic military.

Seeing egregious problems with corruption and inefficiency, he slimmed down the force, creating an administrative structure that was meant to insulate his officers from political and public pressures. Parker wanted his department to set its own agenda, and he wanted his officers thinking of themselves as crime-fighting professionals, not on-call neighborhood boy scouts. On his watch, the sleek and imposing squad car replaced the friendly beat cop. His police academy trained recruits in tactics modeled on military peacekeeping efforts. Some credit the legendary chief with coining the term “thin blue line.”

How Professionalization Became Militarization

Parker was beloved for a reason. He made great strides towards reducing corruption and restoring the image of the LAPD. He was a fan of probity, and not overly enamored of the tough-guy police ideal. If you’ve ever watched “Dragnet,” you’ve seen his running commercial for the style of policing he wanted: upright, prudent, by-the-book.

Professionalization has its benefits, but there are downsides too. Parker’s protégée vividly illustrated this point across his 14 years running the LAPD. Undeniably talented, Daryl F. Gates’ passion for fighting crime was never adequately tempered by an appreciation of restraint. He is remembered today as the father of SWAT (originally meant to be the “Special Weapons Attack Team”), as well as for the thousands of indiscriminate arrests made under “Operation Hammer” in the late 80’s. After a lifetime of pursuing the bad guys, it was sadly ironic that Gates ended his career in a firestorm of criticism over his decision to attend a fundraiser just as the King riots were spiraling out of control. He spent his retirement making police-themed video games. Parker may have “professionalized” the LAPD, but under Gates, it was “militarized.”

We needn’t justify rioting to draw lessons from the King debacle. Realistically, we do need crime-fighters to be tough. At the same time, domestic policing is not warfare, and police can’t be effective when they’ve come to view ordinary citizens as enemy hostiles. Officers are at far greater risk entering neighborhoods where law enforcement is viewed with mistrust. They’re more likely to be targeted, and they can’t get the information they need to close crimes. Professionalization paid certain dividends, but the costs of that distancing were painfully evident on April 29, 1992.

How To Go Beyond Tough-Guy Policing

Is it possible to dial back the aggression and still maintain order? There are reasons to think so. The warrior needs to be balanced by his counterparts: the social worker and the sleuth. In the years since the King riots, two other models of policing have made significant strides in certain parts of the country, giving more space to these two other personae.

Community policing is a self-consciously demilitarized model that encourages officers to cultivate personal connections to the communities they police. In the years following the King riots, the Department of Justice actively promoted community policing, and most departments now incorporate certain elements. The goal is to help police become trusted, credible community members, not just specialized crime-fighters. Military tactics are de-emphasized, and developing community relationships is treated as part of the job. Officers are more extensively trained to recognize and respond to drug addicts and the mentally ill, exploring alternatives to violent force.

These efforts seem to be bearing some fruit in certain neighborhoods, among them the historically-troubled Watts, where LA’s first major riot began. Violent crime is down, and residents indicate that they feel safer. Apparently it is possible to defuse these longstanding tensions, though this does seem to require concentrated and sustained efforts of a sort that might be difficult to replicate in every neighborhood.

The Promise Of ‘Intelligent Policing’ For The Future

Problem-oriented policing (sometimes called “intelligence policing” or “predictive policing”) uses data, analytics, and a results-oriented managerial system to improve crime control without needless aggression. Many elements of this were incorporated into New York’s famous CompStat program, piloted by crime-fighting entrepreneurs like William Bratton. Taking charge of the NYPD’s Transit Police in 1990, Bratton recognized that he was not, for the most part, dealing with hardened criminal masterminds. Trained officers have a huge advantage in dealing with drug addicts, drunks, and gang-banging teenagers; they’re smarter, better-trained, and better-equipped.

With a clearer understanding of crime patterns, we should be able to deploy resources more efficiently, targeting particular problems without being unnecessarily invasive. Sweeping, indiscriminate arrests (such as Gates used) require tremendous manpower and create widespread resentment. Intelligence-based models aim to make policing smarter rather than tougher, and the results in New York and elsewhere have been impressive. They are probably a major reason why crime continued dropping across the late 90’s and early 2000’s.

We Haven’t Entirely Dissolved Unrest

Given these advances, why does policing continue to cause unrest?

Cell phones are one factor. In the early 90’s, frustrated LA residents were jubilant that at last there was real video evidence to substantiate their complaints. Cell phones now inundate us with videos of varying quality, and this “episodic transparency” is a public relations nightmare for police departments. The court of public opinion seems to grow hastier and less judicious with each passing year. Rodney King’s supporters at least waited for a verdict before taking to the streets; Black Lives Matter doesn’t usually offer that same courtesy. A long-term solution will have to involve better transparency and some restoration of public trust. In the short run, things are admittedly volatile.

Beyond the technology issue, the fact remains that a plethora of new theories and techniques won’t automatically translate into reliably good policing. Implementing any of these methods takes considerable time and effort, and they aren’t always easily compatible. Community policing methods are somewhat in tension with the more professionalized model, and the latter has started to seem more relevant again as counterterrorism becomes a growing concern. Intelligence-oriented models aren’t strictly incompatible with either, but they add a level of complexity to police operations that can complicate other efforts. It’s hard to be a warrior, a worker, and a sleuth, all in a single day’s work.

Police officers are expected to be many things to many people. Sometimes, under the pressure of a snap decision, they pick the wrong hat. As we consider the future of policing, we need to ask some hard questions. Is it reasonable to expect police to be tough enough for drug lords and terrorists, but also sensitive enough to deal with peevish teenagers? How many hours can we ask cops to log building community relationships, considering that we also expect them to be rooting out terrorist cells, chasing down muggers, and asking the guy up the street to turn down his stereo? Transparency is good, but we also need a realistic sense of the limits of law enforcement.

We Can Help Prevent Future Riots

Riots are not like earthquakes. Measures can be taken to forestall them. In our time, we need to be more judicious about our use of police power. Police officers should not be used as petty tax collectors, or as a go-to source of manpower for public projects. We should be especially careful about asking police to initiate potentially-violent confrontations with citizens (as in no-knock raids on civilian homes). Maintaining the balance between warrior, worker, and sleuth is hard enough without piling on extra burdens. Beware mission creep.

Finally, we need to work towards greater transparency in policing. In the present climate, it’s not enough just to ask people to support the police. Many people simply don’t trust law enforcement, perhaps for good reasons. Citizens do need to take an active interest in cooperating with police to solve neighborhood problems. Be willing to do more than just protest. But community relations are a two-way street, and better oversight is needed to ensure that abuses are seriously investigated, and that cops with a consistent pattern of problematic behavior aren’t simply allowed to go on terrorizing citizens.

Humans have agency. We can change. Let’s do what we can to prevent a sequel to the Rodney King riots.

Threat Shuts Down Public College After Students Go Postal On Professor,"A public college in Olympia, Washington, shut down yesterday due to a threat of violence telephoned to police after months of screaming sessions and angry accusations of racism precipitated by a college diversity coordinator’s call for white people to vacate campus.

Evergreen State College traditionally holds a “Day of Absence” in April, when nonwhite students would leave campus, “leaving white students to consider the importance of their fellow community members by sensing the real loss of their presence,” according to the student newspaper. This year, Director of First Peoples Multicultural Advising Services Rashida Love announced plans to “encourage” white students to leave campus instead, because identity politics groups “voiced concern over feeling as if they are unwelcome on campus, following the 2016 election.”

Biology professor Bret Weinstein objected to this in an email to Love that was later made public, prompting approximately 50 students to burst into his classroom on May 23, calling him a racist and demanding he resign, he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.

In the email students found offensive, Weinstein explicitly objected to racial segregation and volunteered to host a discussion about race “through a scientific / evolutionary lens,” a lens related to his academic specialty. But, he wrote, “On a college campus, one’s right to speak–or to be–must never be based on skin color.”

“There is a huge difference between a group or coalition deciding to voluntarily absent themselves from a shared space in order to highlight their vital and underappreciated roles…and a group or coalition encouraging another group to go away,” he wrote in the private email. “The first is a forceful call to consciousness which is, of course, crippling to the logic of oppression. The second is a show of force, and an act of oppression in and of itself.”

Weinstein says the Day of Absence went as planned. Its activities included “Radical Self-Care for Students, Faculty, and Staff of Color,” “Know Your Fascists,” and “Can White People Ever Be Woke,” and screenings of the LGBT-themed films “Moonlight” and “Major,” a movie about a black transgender activist.

More than a month later, an “angry mob” of students invaded his classroom, complaining about his private email, Weinstein wrote. Someone called the police. Students went berserk about the presence of police on campus amid their increasingly provocative behavior, and blocked the entrances of buildings they were occupying with furniture to impede police access. They then invaded administrative offices with demands for Weinstein’s resignation and more. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Weinstein gives a short summary of the sequence of events.

The events kicked off a series of groveling sessions with campus administrators. College President George Bridges ordered campus police to stand down even as students grew increasingly aggressive, forcing Weinstein to hold classes in a public park, because “the chief of our college police department told me she could not protect me on campus. Protestors were searching cars for an unspecified individual—likely me.” Videos show groups of students refusing to allow administrators to leave a conference room until they submitted to students’ “demands,” which included:

“Disarming Evergreen Police, with no expansions of police facilities or powers on campus

Sensitivity and cultural competency training for all faculty and staff

The creation of an Equity Center

The coordinator of Trans & Queer Center be hired in a permanent full time position

The creation of a permanent position dedicated to supporting undocumented students”

And “police services sell all of their lethal and less than lethal weapons and donate the money to manifestation of demands enumerated here”;

“Bret Weinstein be suspended immediately without pay but all students receive full credit.”

You can see more here in a video compilation of recent incidents around campus. The protesters have also demanded the college remove the video, and insist it was made by “white supremacists.” To be clear, colleges have no power over YouTube.

In objecting to what they call racism, students make statements and actions that if performed against minorities would probably be enough to bar the perpetrators from polite company forever. For example, students repeatedly shout “Black power.” What if it were “White power”? Also check out a sampling of the things they scream in this video, compiled by The College Fix, and imagine “blackness” or “black” or any other racial description substituted for “white” and “whiteness.”

— “Whiteness is the most violent f-ckin’ system to ever breathe!” — “I’m tired of white people talking about what black and brown people need.” — “These white-ass faculty members need to be holding HIM, and HIM, and ALL these people accountable!” — “I’m tellin’ you, you’re speakin’ to your ancestor, all right? We been here before you. We built these cities, we had civilization way before you ever had … comin’ out your caves.”

In response, Bridges gave a self-parodying public statement. Here’s just the opening.

I’m George Bridges, I use he/him pronouns. I begin our time together today by acknowledging the indigenous people of the Medicine Creek Treaty, whose land was stolen and on which the college stands. I would like to acknowledge the Squaxin people who are the traditional custodians of this land and pay respect to elders past and present of the Squaxin Island Tribe. I extend that respect to other Native people present. In response to Native Student Alliance requests, we commit to opening every event with this acknowledgement.

Bridger went on to tell students who shortly began to scream obscenities at him, “We are grateful to the courageous students who have voiced their concerns…we’ve been working on the concerns you’ve raised and acknowledge that our results have fallen short. We should have done more to engage students in our work on equity and inclusion. This week, you are inviting us into the struggle you have taken up. We share your goals and together we can reach them.”

Obviously Bridges does not get it, and neither does an Evergreen alumnus who works at an in-state paper and attempted to make apologies for the students in a recent column. Although his column is long, nowhere in it does Matt Driscoll give one single fact that justifies students’ menacing behavior. Search the article. The closest he comes to explaining why any adult human being ought to be allowed to act this way in a civilized society is: “When it comes to issues of race, equality, and social justice, there’s a lot going on at Evergreen — like so many college campuses across the country right now.”

Okay, what exactly is “a lot going on”? Did anyone use a racial epithet, besides the protesting students? Does anyone not have equal access to education facilities or activities based on race, except the white students on campus? Have police roughed anyone up, or really done much of anything at all? Seems not, given that professors and students must hide off campus so roving bands of punks don’t find and beat them up. I’m sure we would have heard any of these things if they had occurred. We haven’t heard, because they haven’t occurred. These students are protesting make-believe grievances.

Why would they do that? Because that’s precisely what they’ve been taught to do. They’re cultivated ground troops for the self-styled intellectuals who have chairs of this studies and that studies on their campus. Some of these intellectuals can’t believe that the kids take their preposterous theories about institutional racism and white privilege seriously. Others are in the hallways, egging them on.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/02/threat-shuts-down-public-college-after-students-go-postal-on-professor-objecting-to-racial-segregation/,2017-06-02
Photos From The Portland Clash Between Pro- And Anti-Trump Protesters,"Police arrested at least 14 people Sunday at a free-speech rally in Portland, Oregon organized by President Trump supporters that attracted an anti-Trump “antifa” protest, resulting in violence. Antifa is a loose coalition of self-described “antifascists” known for using violence and vandalism against their political opponents, including at the U.S. capital during President Trump’s inauguration in January.

Photographer Chelly Bouferrache attended the Portland rally and took the following photographs, including the eyewitness descriptions below. Warning: obscene language depicted and quoted.

We were walking up to the Trump Free Speech Rally and had to walk through protesters (many who were Antifa and anarchists) in order to get there. The person with the red kerchief was screaming at the police, “Fuck you, pig. I hope you motherfuckers die!”

Antifa protestors wore black, covered their faces, wore some kind of glasses and helmets.

Protestors across the street from the Trump rally in Chapman Square. The rally was surrounded by protests on three sides. The fourth side is a building that wouldn’t have room for a protest. So to get in or out of the rally the majority of people had to walk a gauntlet of protestors. They weren’t nice. ​

Police in riot gear walking into Chapman Square, just before they closed Chapman Park.

Three journalists. Two were outfitted in a lot of gear. Helmets and such. The woman in hijab was also a journalist I believe. She was approached by one of the III% United Patriots (a militia group). He talked to her and made sure she was okay, told her he wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and that if she needed anything or had a problem to find any of the people providing security and they would help her. I overheard this myself and talked to the man immediately after.

Police had started to clear protestors from Chapman Park using tear gas and flashbangs. ​​

Police in riot gear giving me the peace sign as they drove by. At this point we were trailing the protestors, who had decided to march the streets of Portland once they were kicked out of the parks. The police were coming in from several directions all at once.

Protestor and police square off. The march had been stopped at this point and the protestors were boxed in to one single block on a city street.

Policeman stopped people from leaving that area (in preparation to arrest some for disorderly conduct). Guy who wasn’t allowed to leave filming the officer.

Looking down on the protestors who were being detained by police. They had been boxed in to that single block.

Inside the Trump rally. Head gear and eye gear and protective vests were not quite the norm, but close. I asked a few wearing it why and the response was protestors like to throw projectiles. Bricks, rocks, soda cans, human feces, etc.

Some of the men from the group called the “Proud Boys.” I was informed they were anti-feminist, revere the traditional housewife, and think women belong in the home. Later I got a longer and much more nuanced explanation from the guy in the gray Proud Boys T-shirt. The one with the red beard I had talked to first and he seemed to be defensive. I believe he thought I was either a journalist or anti-Trump. I was just curious about the group and wanted to know what they stood for. That was kind of jarring.

The lady in the middle with the white shirt told me she was a great-grandmother. She also said that President Trump was going to make America great again.

The guy in the grey sweatshirt is Internet famous. I was introduced to him as “Based Stickman.” He was holding court — taking pictures with people and signing things and talking with people.

Based Stickman with the Gadsden Flag.

Trump rally during the speeches. Sure looked to be more than the 200 people Willamette Week reported.

Protesters of the Antifa variety running down the street with a Mercury newspaper bin. I don’t know what the Mercury ever did to them, but it must have been bad.

I told the guy I liked his mask and asked if I could take his picture. Also asked what he was planning doing with the bottle of red stuff. He said it was paint and he was going to spray Trump people with it. I don’t know if he did or not because I left right after. This is self-explanatory. Antifa on the march, after being kicked out of the park, before they got boxed in. This guy was with the fellow who was telling the police he wanted them to die (in the much earlier picture). I went up to him while his friend was screaming, introduced myself, and asked him why the uniform and the helmets. His explanation was they wanted to hide their identities because Trump supporters had gone after them in the past. The helmets were to protect themselves from violent Trump people and the police. I asked if they really wanted the police to die, pointing to his friend, who was still screaming obscenities at the police. He said “Oh no. We are just mad with how the police are treating our friends. We don’t really want them to die.” I asked if I could take his picture and he said yes. Asked his name and he gave me a pseudonym. What struck me was how soft-spoken and polite he was to me. Antifa burning the flag. I was amazed no one caught on fire. Some Parting Eyewitness Thoughts At one point I stood with a different photojournalist taking pictures of Antifa from the Trump side. I asked him some questions about the protestors. He explained that at some point Antifa would more than likely start throwing stuff and the police would then kick them out of the park. They had already thrown bloody tampons (I saw these) and feces (I smelled it and heard about it). While we were standing there the person with him noticed a woman holding what looked like a Molotov cocktail. Looking through the lenses it sure looked like it. They told the police and a few minutes later dozens more police arrived and announced the closure of the park. I have no idea if those two things were connected but one happened right after the other. Flashbangs and tear gas happened soon after. I was taking pictures of Antifa in the street and one of them, a woman, told me to stop taking pictures. I said “No,” and continued to take pictures. She took her backpack off and unzipped it, at which time my friend told me to watch it, that I was probably going to get maced. She pulled out an Antifascist flag and held it up to block my view. She continued to follow me around until I left the area. We followed another photographer friend as Antifa marched through the city until they were boxed in. Police then used tear gas (not exactly sure why). Some of them were trying to escape up into the parking structure and they threw tear gas into the stairwell. As I was bent over retching, wheezing, snotting, and sneezing, one of the protestors walked over to me and asked if I was okay. I explained I have asthma. She whipped out an inhaler and stuck it in my hand (I had left mine in the car) and insisted I keep it. She waited until I caught my breath and quit coughing, then pulled out a little plastic packet of Kleenex and insisted I take that. I asked if I could take her picture and she said yes. I asked why she was there. She said she was LBGTQ and really afraid of what was going to happen under Trump. Her name was Nika. I would have been done for the day and had a hard time getting back to my car if it wasn’t for her. Just a nice moment at an ugly time. This is her looking for the pack of Kleenex. The police I saw were absolute professionals. Amazing how they handled everything. Their job must seem, at times, so thankless.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/06/photos-from-the-portland-clash-between-pro-and-anti-trump-protesters/,2017-06-06

"Shooting At GOP Congressional Baseball Practice Leaves Several Wounded, Including Congressman","A gunman opened fire at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va. Wednesday morning where members of Congress were practicing for a charity baseball game, reportedly injuring Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and four others. Early reports suggest the shooter had a rifle and scope, and police now have him in custody.

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was shot in the hip and at least one other aide was also hit in the chest by a gunman with a rifle who opened fire at a baseball practice in Virginia Wednesday morning, Fox News confirmed. Police tweeted they “believed” the gunman was in custody. Sen. Mike Lee told Fox News, however, the gunman was dead. He said a staffer used a belt as a tourniquet to stop Scalise’s bleeding.

Rep. Mo Brooks described the incident on CNN:

Brooks said he was on deck at a practice for the congressional baseball team when the shooting occurred. Scalise, the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, he added. Brooks said there were a number of congressmen and congressional staffers lying on the ground, and at least one of them was wounded. The Alabama Republican said he used his belt as a tourniquet to help one of the victims.

Law enforcement said the incident appeared to be a “deliberate attack.” Helicopters were in the air on the scene for an hour after the shooting, at least one for transporting wounded to the hospital.

Alexandria police say they engaged the shooter “and returned fire.”

Rep. Brad Wenstrup treated Scalise on the field.

“I did what I did in Iraq,” said Congressman and Army Reserve officer, adding that Scalise was conscious and lucid the whole time he was at the field.

Scalise is now in surgery. A statement from his office said he was in “good spirits” before going in and had talked to his wife on the phone.

“He is grateful for the brave action of the U.S. Capitol Police, first responders, and colleagues,” the statement said.

Scalise’s injury is not life-threatening, a source told ABC.

Sen. Rand Paul told MSNBC he heard 50-60 shots fired. He thought the first shot was a shotgun, “which isn’t that unusual in the South. But then I thought, well, we are in the city, we aren’t in the country here.”

Because Scalise is among Congressional leadership, the team had Capitol Police with them, which Paul said prevented multiple fatalities.

“We finally heard a response from the Capitol Hill police. We’re actually very lucky they were there … One of the things that’s really fortunate — everyone probably would have died, except for the fact that the Capitol Hill police were there…If Scalise hadn’t been on our team … it would have been a massacre.”

Rep. Jeff Duncan and Rep. Ron DeSantis told media they spoke to a man they believed to be the shooter as they left practice at about 7:10, five to 10 minutes before shooting started:

Sen. Jeff Flake described to CBS being sheltered in the dugout, not knowing if they were surrounded. The shooting lasted at least 10 minutes, according to Flake, before the shooter was taken down. Rep. Joe Barton’s 10-year-old son was at the practice, and members put him in the dugout under a bench.

The Acquittal Verdict In The Philando Castile Case Is An Abomination,"It is a genuinely open question whether an American police officer can do almost anything without suffering criminal consequences. Americans have a profoundly stupid and misguided deferential attitude toward law enforcement, one which presumes that police officers—fallible, often incompetent, and frequently temperamental human beings—are worthy of some sort of extra-special benefit of the doubt about their professional behavior. American citizens have no problem suing doctors for their back molars on the flimsiest of pretexts, but we generally cannot bring ourselves to convict police officers for demonstrably inept and reckless behavior that often costs people their lives.

That is the lesson we learn, yet again, in the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez, a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer who last year shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop. At face value the incident is a perfect storm of a tragedy. Yanez thought Castile might have been a robbery suspect; Castile was carrying a pistol (for which he had a valid permit), and informed Yanez of this as he reached for his license. Yanez, allegedly believing that Castile was reaching for his declared firearm, consequently opened fire.

You can sort of understand Yanez’s hasty reaction—if you don’t think about it too much. Upon reflection there was no good reason for Yanez to have opened fire upon Castile. He had no indication there was any reason to do so. As the prosecutor in Yanez’s criminal trial put it, “Unreasonable fear cannot justify the use of deadly force. The use of deadly force must be objectively reasonable and necessary, given the totality of the circumstances.”

Acknowledging a Weapon Is Not a Crime

A man telling you he is permitted to carry a firearm while he’s reaching for his license does not, by any rational standard, give one “objectively reasonable and necessary” justification for shooting that man. It also beggars belief that someone with murderous intent would politely inform a police officer of his concealed weapon before pulling it out to use it. How many cop-killers give their victims a calm and friendly heads-up before opening fire?

Yanez should have known this. He was no fresh-faced rookie just out of the academy; he had been on the force for four years. The charges eventually leveled at him—second-degree manslaughter and two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm—were perfectly reasonable given the circumstances. Nobody was asking that Yanez be charged with first-degree murder and be given the death penalty; prosecutors simply asked that he be brought to justice for behavior that would have landed any one of the rest of us in prison.

But that didn’t happen, for the simple reason that we have a queer aversion to convicting police officers when they quite obviously break the law. A few years ago a police officer in South Carolina shot Walter Scott in the back as Scott was running away, an incident captured on video, leaving no doubt as to just what had transpired. Even the crystal-clear evidence of the officer’s criminal behavior, however, wasn’t enough to convict him. The jury ended up hung and a mistrial was declared.

Obvious video evidence of an officer putting five shots into a man’s back should lead to a slam-dunk conviction after about three minutes of deliberation. That it didn’t—and that this kind of thing happens, in varying degrees, all the time—suggests that Americans have a deeply dysfunctional and unhealthy attitude about what constitutes acceptable police behavior.

To its great credit, the St. Anthony Police Department has announced that Yanez will no longer be a part of their force. Call it a matter of politics, optics, or something else, but in the end it is a good thing that Yanez is off the streets. But it is still not enough. He should, by any sensible metric of justice, be behind bars.

Philando Castile is dead, and he’s dead because Yanez killed him for no good reason. This is not a hard nut to crack. We should not be afraid to prosecute and convict law enforcement officers for unjustly killing innocent people. The police, good as they can be, are not above the law. Nobody is.

Mom Ticketed For Neglect After Calling Police To Help Free Toddler,"A mother in Omaha paid a price for calling 911 this week. On Tuesday, a gust of wind blew the door of her SUV shut, locking her toddler inside.

According to the mother, her daughter had been at a pool with her aunt. When they arrived back at their home near 36th Street and Olin Avenue about 3 p.m., the aunt turned off the SUV and put her keys inside the car. The girl was in a child seat in the back of the vehicle. ‘When she exited from the car and opened the rear door, the wind pushed the doors closed and locked them,’ an officer wrote of the account from the girl’s mother in the report.

The girl’s mother said they tried to free the almost-two-year-old from the hot car using several tools for about 15 minutes and called a roadside assistance service, which said it would take another 30 minutes to arrive. They then called police, who arrived on the scene, broke the car’s window to free the girl, and ticketed the mother for suspected child abuse by neglect.

Wait, what? Yes.

The police department is defending itself in press and on social media against charges it overreacted. The temperature was in the 90s, and officers measured the temperature in the car at 97 degrees after the window was broken, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The toddler was taken to a local hospital, but was fine.

A police spokesperson had this to say: “We make decisions in the moment with all the information we have available. This can be a super dangerous situation. People die in these circumstances.”

It can be a dangerous situation. Cars heat up quickly on a hot day, sometimes beyond what a small child’s body can take. In the most tragic situations, small children are forgotten in cars and die.

But this child was not forgotten. Her relatives were trying to free her from the car and called the police for help doing that. They were in the very act of not neglecting her. The mother had a perfectly reasonable explanation for how it happened, corroborated by weather reports from the day showing wind gusts of 40 mph, and the child was unhurt.

Can’t we just leave it at that? Can’t we give parents in a scary moment even 20 minutes of grace? Like police, she was also making a decision in the moment.

That’s what this amounts to. Some will say the only correct response is to bash in the car window seconds after the child has gotten locked. Some will say they’d call 911 immediately. I’m in the camp that would likely try a few options before resorting to property damage and police, at least in part because I’m not really keen on breaking glass with force in the direction of my children.

But this is a difference of opinion and approach, not a criminal matter. Parenting is an endless stream of everyday judgment calls made in the moment. Parenting in public feels increasingly perilous when one’s fellow citizens seem more and more likely to report them to authorities if they disagree with one, and authorities seem more and more likely to punish people for common accidents.

Making every call with the worst-case scenario in mind is not a healthy way to parent or police, and our society does far too much of it in both realms. The “last resort” is called that because there are other resorts that should come before it. Let’s not dispense with them.

I am now less keen on calling the police in a similar situation, which is not what any of us should want. The mother involved now has a case being referred to local prosecutors, who will decide whether they should file charges. One hopes common sense will prevail at that stage of the process, but it should have prevailed at the scene.

The police spokesperson added, “Don’t be afraid to call 911 for help.” Tell that to the woman being charged for the wind’s actions.

It’s Time To Allow Concealed-Carry Permits In Washington DC,"In the wake of the targeted shooting of Republicans at baseball practice and the heroic efforts of capitol police to apprehend the shooter, it’s time we revisit an ineffective, unconstitutional law that bans adults from obtaining concealed-carry permits inside the District of Columbia.

Not only do our representatives and other government officials deserve to feel safe while doing their civic duty on our behalf, but the rest of us who enjoy DC regularly have a right to protect ourselves while visiting a hotspot for crime.

More Guns Save Lives By Democratizing Force

If any area of the country should expand gun laws, it’s Washington DC, where power is centralized, crime is rampant, and more guns will save lives. As the hub of political activity where our political leaders gather and work, there’s often hardly enough police or security to go around for representatives and their aides. Many work, attend meetings, and travel accompanied by a staff member and no protection whatsoever.

In the case of the Alexandria shooting, armed police were only on-site because a member of congressional leadership was also, which allowed a quicker resolution to an awful situation as they immediately returned fire. But what if Majority Whip Steve Scalise hadn’t been present? More people would likely have been injured or killed.

Although crime, particularly homicide, is down in the District, violent crime is still higher than the national average and the city, along with nearby Baltimore, is among the top murder capitals of the nation. Recently while at my favorite kid-friendly restaurant on Capitol Hill, I asked a cop what it was like to try to stop crime there. He shook his head and said they often reprimand the same perpetrators over and over. What about loosening gun restrictions? “They never will,” he said with a sigh. “This city is too liberal.”

The Nation’s Gun Control Mecca

Washington DC gun laws are far too strict. Currently, buying and selling handguns is illegal in the District. Residents and non-residents can apply for a concealed-carry permit, but due to a stay issued by a federal appeals court last year, “DC Just Cause” is in effect. That means folks seeking a permit to lawfully carry must go through an arduous process that includes meeting multiple requirements, “including demonstrated to the Chief good reason to fear injury to his or her person or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a pistol.”

Once the paperwork is filled out, granting permission is still at the discretion of local police. Should the police finally give permission for an individual who has demonstrated “need” to acquire his concealed-carry permit, there are still restrictions on top of that.

Even after that, a lawmaker who’s been threatened before and established his need for a permit can’t reload his six-shot revolver more than once on his foes as that would equal 12 rounds, the max amount allowed in DC. But isn’t the whole point of acquiring a concealed-carry permit to allow for personal protection or protection of defenseless around you? Limiting law-abiding citizens’ ability to protect themselves and others only makes innocents vulnerable to bad people, who have less regard for following the law. If you’re going to commit murder, you’re not going to be worrying about breaking a rounds restriction in the process.

The Second Amendment Is Constitutional, Ya’ll

Of course, fans of the Second Amendment already know the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia addressed this issue in his epic, must-read majority opinion for District of Columbia v. Heller, a landmark case overruling the District’s previous outright gun ban, for which the District has substituted an effective paperwork ban.

It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upperbody strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid. We must also address the District’s requirement (as applied to respondent’s handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.

Lawmakers in places like DC don’t want the average adult walking around with a concealed-carry permit because they too have bought into the absurd lie that more frequent bearing of loaded weapons would be a menace to society. This has been debunked so many times it’s hardly worth doing so here. Dozens of statistics show the more gun control decreases, the more crime does too. In other words, the more people possess guns, the less others commit crime. There are countless stories of people protecting themselves or loved ones with a legally purchased handgun.

I Just Want to Protect My Kids from Crazies

Although I live in Northern Virginia, as a mother of four who homeschools at least one history buff, we make regular, often weekly, trips into DC for various festivals, conventions, exhibits, or just to revisit an favorite museum or monument. I find every year my kids are able to glean more from the same exhibits they’ve seen dozens of times.

However, in the wake of so many terrorist attacks over the last five years, especially of “soft” targets, I’ve often wondered how I would protect myself and my four kids should tragedy strike while we are visiting one of the most targeted areas in the world. The National Mall, for example, is a wonderful place to learn and roam, but there’s very little shelter. If something tragic happened there, we’d have difficulty hiding or finding shelter, let alone actively protecting ourselves.

I’m a sane adult but don’t have an express vocational need for protection, except protecting the valuables my children represent. If I were allowed to possess a concealed-carry permit, I could rest a little easier knowing I could proactively protect my children and those around me in the event of sudden crisis. As Scalia said in Heller,

Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.

No, it is not. As a friend said to me in an e-mail, “The de facto ban on concealed carry is why I travel to D.C. as little as possible. I’m way more likely to get knifed or shot or robbed there than I am just anywhere else, and it’s the one place I can’t legally defend myself. Forget that.” So it’s time for the District to lift its tight restrictions on gun laws, allow reasonable adults to acquire a concealed-carry permit, and let everyone rest easier in our nation’s capital.

Police Video Of Philando Castile’s Death Confirms He Didn’t Have To Die,"The release of the video capturing Philando Castile’s death at the hands of police officer Jeronimo Yanez has confirmed what many on the Left and Right have stated about the incident from the start: the killing cannot be justified.

After Castile was pulled over, he carefully announced to Yanez that he was legally carrying a weapon, and was only reaching into his jacket pocket for his drivers’ license. Yanez told Castile not to pull out his gun. Castile confirmed he was not going to do so, then continued reaching into his jacket pocket as he had been instructed. Yanez warned him again, shouting this time, then opened fire.

We will never know for certain what was going through Yanez’s mind as he pulled the trigger, but the information we have indicates that his fear, real though it may have been, was not reasonable, and unreasonable fear can never justify the use of force.

Philando Castile Did Everything He Should Have

Reason compels us to acknowledge that it was unlikely that Castile, a school cafeteria worker who had no history with Yanez, had it out for him from the start. A man with nefarious intentions toward Yanez would also be unlikely to state openly that he was carrying a gun, as Castile did.

It is far more likely that Castile was doing exactly what concealed carriers are instructed to do in his situation: he let Yanez know he was carrying a weapon for the express purpose of avoiding escalating tension. Yanez, after all, would have been taken aback if he saw the weapon without knowing it would be there, and Castile assuring him that he was reaching for his wallet, not his gun, would keep Yanez from deciding he had to shoot to protect himself.

Even the measured wording of Castile’s statement—“Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me”—suggests a conscientious attempt to clarify what is happening far more than it does a threat. Contra Yanez’s peculiar contention, marijuana odor does nothing to change this calculus. Merely stating that one has a weapon, even to a police officer, in the absence of any real indicator of danger, is not a crime in a country that guarantees its citizens the right to bear arms.

Not only was Castile’s carrying a weapon and making Yanez aware of it not a crime, it was legally protected. The danger present in being a police officer—and I do not underestimate how real that danger is—does not trump the law or constitutional rights. Indeed, the opposite must be the case in a free society.

Police Power Is Not Unlimited

Police officers are empowered to act upon reasonable fear of imminent danger to protect themselves, with reasonable being the operative word. Fear itself is not sufficient, as it can be based on just about anything—including, yes, skin color. The fact that distinguishing between reasonable and unreasonable fear is a heavy and difficult question is why it takes a noble person to be a good police officer.

Proper law enforcement requires both courage and wisdom to stare down danger and continue to uphold the law while doing so. Men placed in this position of power who do not have the ability to judge these situations well will harm innocent people, and when this happens those responsible must be held as accountable as anyone else.

Even if Yanez’s fear was real and not at all informed by prejudice, it was still not reasonable, and it still caused him to wrongly shoot a man who had committed no crime, for the simple fact that the man’s legal exercise of a constitutional right made him uncomfortable. For that he should be facing jail time. It is hard to fault those who demonstrate in protest. This sort of affair has been sparking outrage in this country since 1770, and I don’t think even John Adams in all his honor and skill would have found it in himself to defend Yanez in this instance.

Our Rights Are Meaningless If Not Protected

This is an event that conservatives and libertarians, if we are true to our principles, must speak on. Castile committed no crime. He was, by all accounts, a decent man whom his community loved. Indeed, he seems to have been exactly the sort of man that our Second Amendment exists to protect and empower—a “good guy with a gun.” And he was killed for it. He was killed simply because a police officer believed his lawful possession of a handgun to be too dangerous for his own liking.

If this standard goes unchallenged, and we establish the legal precedent that a civilian’s possession of a weapon makes him a threat that can be countered with the highest level of force, then it matters not what happens in our legislatures in the debate over gun rights. The right to bear arms will be meaningless, a mere sentiment that can be blown away by the state at any time its agents like.

The Second Amendment’s guarantee of a fundamental right to self-ownership and self-defense, including against a tyrannical state, is necessary. But if it does not protect citizens like Castile from having those rights violated, or hold accountable the agents of the state who violate those rights, then it means nothing and protects no one. The assault on Castile’s rights—to his life, his liberty, and yes, his right to bear arms—is an assault on all of us.

"One Year After Philando Castile’s Death, 4 Black Leaders Remember","In a season when Americans celebrate our freedoms, questions surrounding the fate of one man’s life and liberties remain unresolved. A beloved son and local school cafeteria worker, 32 year-old Philando Castile was fatally shot in small-town St. Anthony, Minnesota on July 6, 2016—one year ago this week.

During a traffic stop, with Castile’s girlfriend and her daughter in the vehicle, police officer Jeronimo Yanez shot the young black man five times at point-blank range. Dash-cam video footage released on June 20 led to renewed outcry across the political spectrum including in National Review, “The Daily Show,” and The Federalist.

Following a week of deliberation that hinged on the officer’s testimony, a jury of 12 Minnesota citizens found Yanez not guilty of two criminal charges: felony manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm. Yanez was soon released from the police force. Ten days later, on June 26, the City of St. Anthony reached a $3 million settlement with the Castile family to resolve any civil claims.

“The death of Philando Castile is a tragedy for his family and for our community,” read the joint statement by the city and Castile family. “No amount of money could ever replace Philando… The family will continue to deal with their loss through the important work of the Philando Castile Relief Foundation.”

In such a flashpoint of racial tensions, we can learn much by listening well to wise leaders in the black community. Now, black voices from across America offer their views on this tragedy, and what we can learn as we share in the family’s grief.

When a Four Year-Old Tries to Comfort Her Mom

A speaker and writer based in Connecticut, Christina Marie Bennett believes the best lens to see this story through is the eyes of a child.

“Finding out Officer Yanez was acquitted from all charges regarding Philando Castile was tragically perplexing,” she states. “I felt genuinely confused as to how any jury could come to that verdict. Later, when I saw the video of Diamond Reynolds’ 4 year-old daughter comforting her as she was handcuffed in the police car, I was brokenhearted.”

In the viral video, the young girl assures her mom: “I can keep you safe.”

“I assumed that footage of a precious girl in pain would move even the hardest heart. I was wrong. Some people were so caught up in who was right or wrong that they couldn’t connect with the cries of a child. I don’t know what we can learn from an injustice like this, but I know how we can respond. Coming together in empathy and compassion is not an option—it’s something we must do,” Bennett implores.

“We argue about #BlackLivesMatter, #PoliceLivesMatter, and #AllLivesMatter, but beyond the social media fights lies a needed truth. We are all human and we should all be able to look at the footage of that sweet girl asking for a safer world and weep. Along with our tears of grief, we must act by works of justice to make that child’s request a reality.”

Philando Castile Shows Our Justice System is Broken

For Nicola Menzie, pursuing justice in the Castile case and others like it has become all-consuming. Her career as a religion reporter in New York City landed her stories on the Religion News Service and The Christian Post. Yet she noticed that coverage about communities of color, particularly in the Christian press, often lacked depth and authenticity.

This past January, she launched Faithfully Magazine “for people who aspire to do good, obey God, and stay woke.” Menzie and her team have written extensively on Castile’s story.

“Evangelical Christians should not entertain excuses as to why compliant, non-threatening civilians ‘deserve’ to die in encounters with inept police officers. If a jury’s refusal to hold a cop accountable for taking a man’s life and endangering an unarmed woman and child does not alarm you, then you are fast asleep,” states Menzie.“It is a travesty Philando Castile’s life was taken in such a way; a travesty his mother is expected to console herself with money; and a travesty a child is forever scarred by witnessing a cop shoot a man to death.”

She concludes: “I grieve this miscarriage of justice and pray we act to change a broken system.”

When ‘No Comment’ Says Much More

One published author, a mother of three sons, felt she could only address the situation indirectly. Requesting to remain anonymous, she sent on an excerpt of a message to her prayer partners.

“There is a risk whenever anyone speaks in less-than-glowing terms about a split-second decision a law enforcement officer makes. It’s even riskier for a person of color to do so. The truth is, I am afraid. In this day and age, actual persecution on American soil is more likely than it has been for decades for people who look like my kids and me. Surely the fear and intimidation I’m experiencing hinders the cause of Christ,” she confesses.

“Though I would never write anything harsh, because of my color I’d better be extra careful. After all, it’s no exaggeration that I could be shot, in my car, buckled in, with my kid there, totally complying with the officer’s request, with two different video clips of the encounter, no alcohol, no police record… and still the officer who shot me would be found ‘not guilty.’ This makes people like me want to shut up and stay out of it as much as humanly possible.”

“I know I should write a response,” the author concludes to her small circle of praying friends. “But this climate has made me afraid to, which comes straight from the pit of hell. Will you pray for me? Encourage me?”

We Cannot Lose Hope, Says One Black Pastor

Will Ford, an author and teacher who co-leads a church in the Dallas area, sees a big picture view of race relations. He begins, “I agree with David French, the Harvard-trained lawyer, veteran, and leading thinker who stated that the Yanez/Castile verdict was a great ‘miscarriage of justice.’ Yet we have to be careful how we handle this as pastors and leaders.”

“This tragedy can drive a bigger wedge between us,” Ford cautions. “We struggle with many questions: was Castile reaching for his gun or for his wallet? With the way the law is written, if Yanez feels he’s being threatened does he have the right to shoot? All those things come into play. But we can’t see inside that vehicle. And we can get consumed with this case in a way that’s going to bring more division.”

“One Scripture passage has become my playbook for all this,” says Ford. “It’s Second Timothy chapter two, which says in part: ‘The Lord’s bondservant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition…’ As a Christian, I embrace being a bondservant of God—not a bondservant of either the conservatives or the liberals. We are going to be held accountable, that we respond differently than the world.”

“Our nation has actually come farther on racial issues than we ever have before. We cannot let this one case be a defining moment that says, This is how all police are or This is how black lives will always be devalued. We have to keep the dialogue going. We have to be the ones who contend for healing,” he says with hope.

“We also contend for justice, dealing with the bigger issues—because systemically, it’s a complex situation when you look at how class and race tensions play into these incidents. My prayer is that God would use this crucible that we’re all in right now to bring us closer together, that we’d become more united rather than divided.”

Lena Dunham Epitomizes Our Self-Enforcing Police State,"Lena Dunham had a delayed flight and was walking through the airport when she overheard two American Airlines employees having an unapproved private conversation about transgender children. So she did what you naturally do when you are a well-known “liberal” who believes in free speech and distrusts big corporations: she ratted them out to their employer on Twitter.

Not gonna call out the airline who delayed cuz shit happens BUT I did just overhear 2 @AmericanAir attendants having a transphobic talk. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) August 3, 2017

What took this from being merely bullying and repressive to being creepy and totalitarian in style is that Dunham didn’t just make a general complaint. She then posted what looks like direct messages or text message between her and the American Airlines account, in which she enthusiastically provides detailed information about exactly where the conversation took place.

Well this night just keeps evolving pic.twitter.com/gYfXadYBUH — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) August 3, 2017

Saying “I overheard a conversation” but giving no specifics might prompt American Airlines to send out a general notice to its employees to watch what they say while in the terminal—which is a little unsettling in itself. But giving specific information only has one purpose: to help the airline locate, identify, and punish these specific employees for holding politically incorrect views.

It’s the hashtag #acrossfromthewinebar that sent chills down my spine. Dunham is acting like an informant working for a totalitarian police state—but boastfully, in public, on social media. With a hashtag.

Undoubtedly, someone will point out that this isn’t really totalitarianism because these are all voluntary actions by private citizens and organizations, not the government. Dunham isn’t a paid stooge of the police, but a citizen acting on her own initiative. American Airlines isn’t doing this because the government told them to, but because they’re terrified of bad press. (Which they are still going to get, but from the other side.)

Yet somehow this makes it all worse, because it implies we are being trained to internalize the ethos of the police state—and to enact it voluntarily, on our own initiative, without having to be coerced. We’re building a self-enforcing police state.

Recently, I warned that The New York Times is trying to rehabilitate Communism. When the Left finally succeeds in resuscitating totalitarianism, we will already know all about how to inform on our neighbors by way of Twitter.

There are three substantial ways in which this incident shows how we are preparing ourselves for totalitarianism. One of the hallmarks of totalitarianism is that the officially approved truth was capricious and unpredictable, and that was on purpose. They wanted the approved ideology to change so quickly that there was no way to comply with it by sincere personal conviction. The only way to comply with it was out of a habit of obedience.

Now, let’s apply that to the substance of the conversation Dunham was reporting, which she reports to American Airlines in highly specific and intellectual terms: “I heard 2 females attendants walking talking about how trans kids are a trend they’d never accept a trans child and transness is gross.” The idea that “gender identity disorder,” which has now been renamed to the more politically correct “gender dysphoria,” is not a mental illness but instead a valid lifestyle to be encouraged and humored is relatively recent, working its way into the mainstream in the past ten years. The idea of transgender children—of taking a child’s normal confusion about gender roles, encouraging it, magnifying it, and using it as the basis for irreversible medical treatments—would have been considered a form of child abuse to most people until about last year. For many of us, it still is.

But why wait for the process of changing mores and attitudes to work their way through the culture and bring people around to your side? After all, if you wait for people to be convinced, there’s a chance that they won’t be. It’s like what Stalin said about elections: the problem is that you don’t know ahead of time who’s going to win. Intead, people have to immediately update their views to be consistent with the Current Truth, subject to change without notice.

Now let’s look at Dunham’s reaction. She hears two people saying something she disagrees with, and it never occurs to her to talk to them directly, to attempt to persuade them or to listen to their point of view and engage with it. She might have changed someone’s mind or least gotten to understand the reasons for their views. But why wait for persuasion when you can use fear? Why engage individuals directly, as if they are fellow human beings with equal rights, when you can go over their heads and use your fame and influence to pressure their employers?

While reading about this story, I was reminded of this scene from “The Lives of Others,” based on life within the oppressive police state of East Germany.

Apparently, the same rules apply now. Better watch what you say, or powerful person might ask for your employee number and your life will be ruined.

Finally, consider the role of the employer. When the Czech dissident Vaclav Havel formulated his ideas for how to resist Communist tyranny, he noted the role of the small business or employer who agreed to enforce the rules and post the propaganda of the regime out of fear and conformity. Well, that’s exactly what we’re up against now.

If the proper response for Dunham was to converse with those flight attendants directly (or maybe just to mind her own business), then the proper response of American Airlines was to tell Dunham that it is not in the business of policing the private conversations of its employees. But that’s another way we’re being prepared for the police state. While the Left blusters about how they don’t want big corporations to tell us what we can think, their actions say otherwise. They absolutely do want employers to be responsible for the private views and political activity of their employees—so long as the views they are enforcing are politically correct.

So all the elements are being put together. We have a dogma propagated from the top down, a cadre of informants who are proud and eager to report their fellow citizens, and private institutions that are cowed and co-opted, ready to deprive dissidents of their livelihoods.

It’s no mystery why, despite loud protestations that things will be different this time, socialism always ends with the midnight knock on the door. By the time government begins arresting people, the public will already have the mentality needed to accept and cooperate with the police state.

When we talk about and celebrate the fall of Communism, we frequently focus on the positive role of “people power.” When the oppressed people of Eastern Europe chose to reject and resist Communism en masse, it collapsed seemingly overnight. But we don’t like to think too much about the flip side of that coin. Totalitarian regimes came into existence, and maintained their existence, not just because dissenters were killed or kept in a state of terror, but also because the regimes enjoyed the active complicity of a large segment of the population. East Germany’s Stasi, after all, had a lot of employees.

The recent exploits of Comrade Lena are a warning that the new police state will have plenty of its own enthusiastic enforcers.

"For Fear Of Leaks, Google Cancels All-Hands Meeting Over Firing Fiasco","What is actually happening in tech right now? Accounts vary. According to The New York Times, “the alt-right” has found “a new enemy in Silicon Valley.” From a different standpoint, however, the reverse seems closer to the truth.

But the mania around the recent firing of an elite tech employee on “anti-diversity” grounds suggests that presenting the conflict as Tech vs. Pepe obscures far more than it reveals. American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Hoff Sommers provocatively cast the reverberating ordeal in terms that will be familiar to my readers. “Google,” she told the Heritage Foundation’s Daily Signal, “excommunicated James Damore for crimes against the Pink Police State.” What would it mean for this to be true?

A good place to go in search of an answer is the structure of today’s economy. Responding to journalists’ “1st-Amendment hot takes on the Google memo,” novelist Jake Bacharach tweeted dryly: “Y’all really need to get real jobs and learn about Human Resources.” Rather than a smug ideological attack on freethinkers or alt-righters or whomever, this rejoinder ought to be read as a plain reflection of fact about the way work has been institutionalized in our time.

Diversity and Inclusion Are Sociological Practices

As I have been cautioning since 2009, “the utter dominance of Human Resources departments over the businesses and industries that host them” is the defining feature of the workplace today—especially the “knowledge work” that exerts such dominance over our economy, and, within the realm of knowledge work, especially the elite sector of monopolistic technology corporations that includes Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon.

Lost in the unfolding culture war over how much “science” is on the side of diversity and inclusion is the simple point that the logic of human resources control is objectively a central, even founding feature of economic life—no less than the place of “compliance” in the financial services and related industries, which has come to supersede the practice of capitalism.

Although as far as ideal types go, the Pink Police State is provocative by design, I have taken care to emphasize that its power is analytical first and ideological a trailing second. “The 1st Amendment,” as I noted in 2014’s Pink Police State series, is “blind to the state’s current interest in establishing a secular, not religious, creed. This is key to understanding the absolute importance of ‘diversity and inclusion.’ These foundational ideas are not best seen as ‘ideological values.’ They are sociological practices essential to the functioning of the new regime.”

That regime, in turn, arose less from the machinations of a revolutionary vanguard than from the breakdown of the socioeconomic structures that defined the workplace from the New Deal through the postwar era. It all came to a head during 1999’s Battle in Seattle, when the architects of the global liberal order realized that the truly existentially threatening ideology to arise after the Cold War was internal, not external, to that order.

The rise of the Pink Police State, I concluded, is “a so-far successful attempt to use the kinetic energy of spreading, deepening equality to therapeutically resolve the geopolitical anxiety of the elite on the one hand and the deep disenchantment of the people on the other. It is the rise of a somewhat forcibly negotiated settlement between the imperatives of the contending forces whose war was announced at the Battle of Seattle—the elite technocratic order and its popular erotocratic opposition.” Today’s economic structure is the fruit of that uneasy peace.

This Brings Us to James Damore

This is why the swiftness of Damore’s firing and the shock waves it continues to spread are so noteworthy. Google’s all-hands meeting designed to put a stop to the turmoil was cancelled at the last minute out of fear of leaks.

Google CEO: some of you are worried that you cannot speak out at work freely. pic.twitter.com/T8FSvwRHf4 — Scott McGrew (@ScottMcGrew) August 11, 2017

This strongly suggests that not just the gentler enforcement mechanisms of the current regime, but in fact the structure of the regime itself, is breaking down, in a way that could accelerate dramatically or hit a sudden tipping point. For if not even the most prestigious and powerful instantiation of the knowledge workplace can operate any longer without disruptive challenges to its foundational ideas, what does that say about the weakness of the subaltern parts of our socioeconomic superstructure?

The deepest lesson to be learned from the Damore affair goes well beyond considerations of class or gender, whether from a “social-justice” standpoint or an “alt-right” one. As Bacharach’s quip intimated, today, if you are an employee, you are, as a matter of institutional economic design, not free. The structure of employment in the global liberal order is predicated on not merely an absence of freedom but on an affirmative servitude, a slavery of conscience that can always reach to the deepest levels of moral principle.

Neoliberals and progressives will insist that tremendous social and economic gains have resulted on net from this arrangement—and they will be right! Demonstrably so! In large part for this reason, younger people have gravitated away from self-employment and entrepreneurialism, flowing like lemmings or pilgrims toward the absolute “top tier” of metropolises, there to pledge fealty to those who exact conscience compliance from their human resources in the production of goods and services capable of forestalling anti-“capitalist” revolution.

But some younger Americans—and not just Americans—know well the freedom of conscience and thought that employment negates today, and their counter-Pink Police State worldview is developing around patterns of thinking deeper and more sophisticated than the kinds of resentful nostrums that are so often attributed to the alt-right. Some of those inside the emerald cities of Silicon Valley, who still intuit the freedom they have sacrificed, have been watching and waiting to see how the Damore affair plays out. Some are beginning to look for the exits. Others are reaching for pitchforks.

Employment, it is safe to say, will never die. But its current animating spirit may not be long for this world. Place your bets: Will the Pink Police State live to celebrate its twentieth birthday?

Charlottesville Shows Once Again Why Blue Lives Matter,"The white supremacist rally that erupted into violence in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend showcased the absolute worst parts of humanity. The media deemed the men and women who marched in the streets of this sleepy college town and onto the University of Virginia’s campus as the “alternative right.” That’s a label too kind and undeserving.

The hateful individuals promenading with tiki torches and swastika signs while chanting “blood and soil” shouldn’t belong to any political party in the United States. In fact, they should have no place in society, period. They were extremists. They were Nazis. One could even describe the congregation of Klu Klux Klan members and white supremacists as terrorists, because driving a car into a herd of innocent people that resulted in one death is an act of terrorism.

Stop politicizing these fanatics by calling them the Right. They are as dangerous and irrational as Antifa, the extremist group associated with the far Left. These radical groups, or anyone who identifies with them, do not belong in any kind of rational political discourse—for either side.

Another source of heated conversation has been our law enforcement. Frequently, police officers in this country receive criticism for an often-dangerous job that, quite frankly, not many would have the bravery to do. As we witnessed in Charlottesville, it’s not just a question of physical danger; it’s mental as well.

A photo went viral during the protests on Saturday. In the picture, a black police officer is seen standing guard in front of a congregation of men waving Confederate flags and giving Nazi salutes. He understandably appears disappointed, listless even. Yet still this man bravely stood in place and fulfilled his oath to protect and serve the community, even while parts of that same community openly shunned him.

At the time the photo made the rounds, nobody even knew this man’s name. Just like the subject of the photo, its photographer was unidentified at the peak of going viral. It wasn’t until posting the picture myself on social media that the man’s identity was brought to light. His name is Darius Ricco Nash, and that photo was actually taken during a similar protest in July. It had nothing to do with the Charlottesville protest and everything to do with it at the same time.

Not once, but twice, this man had to protect those who hated him. Thousands of Twitter retweets offered him the utmost praise. It was praise that he and thousands of other police officers deserve regularly. But why did it feel too little too late?

Our justice system is far from perfect, but Democrats are the first to label cops as quick-to-pull-the-trigger racists. For all the public scrutiny our law enforcement officers have received over the past year or so, officers of every race risk their lives to keep order and peace. Why did we need a photograph, albeit poignant and impactful, to remind people of that?

When Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem at football games to protest police treatment of black lives, did he ever think about the black lives serving in blue? When Kaepernick wore socks depicting police officers as pigs, did he think about brave men like Nash? As evidenced in that one picture and demonstrated hourly, police officers literally put their lives on the front line, not on the sidelines.

Nash is an American hero for his service, and we should admire his patience to stand his ground in a sea of white supremacists. But it shouldn’t take a photograph for people to realize that. It shouldn’t take the lives of five police officers murdered in Dallas a little more than a year ago for people to understand police are sometimes the only thing holding the seams of this country together.

No amount of punditry can make sense of what happened in Charlottesville. It won’t bring back the life of Heather Heyer, the 32-year old woman run over by a car in the street. It certainly will not erase the violent images displayed around the world from what ordinarily is a relatively safe city.

But let Nash’s image give us all hope. The next time an American wants to generalize and paint all police officers negatively, think about that image of him. Remember that in chaos and fear, police officers like Nash might be the only thing that can unite us. Blue lives do matter, and in Charlottesville we saw one of the many reasons why.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/14/charlottesville-shows-blue-lives-matter/,2017-08-14
What Happens When Police Stand By During Vandalism And Violence,"Let’s start with a review of the basics. Racists, and others with repugnant views, have a right to be repugnant and express those views in public in this country. We protect their right to free speech because if we fail to, we could very quickly endanger less repugnant views. As the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted this weekend, “The same laws used to silence bigots can be used to silence you.”

Counter-protesters, including Antifa, which has a history of violent tendencies, also have a right to protest gatherings of people with whom they disagree. Both sides are protected in this country, regardless of the content of their message. Things that aren’t legal and protected: assault, murder, vandalism, and all-out street battles between these two groups. Charlottesville wasn’t the first time they clashed, and it won’t be the last. So, how to keep one from becoming the other?

Charlottesville’s police force was criticized for letting protests devolve over a day and a half with little intervention. There will no doubt be better information about how exactly that happened after the city investigates the events that led up to the murder of 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injury of 20 others at the hands of a white nationalist who plowed his car into a group of protesters. Let’s leave the most complex and controversial model of policing from this week aside until we have the “extensive review” ordered by Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

But a similar meeting of protest and counter-protest happened in Seattle, and a gathering of protesters in Durham, North Carolina devolved into mob action that brought down a statue on public property. These two events were policed in very different ways.

Police forces are absolutely vital to protecting the outer limit of freedom for political speech while preventing a breakdown into brawling. This is a really, really hard job in an ever-changing environment sometimes animated by two sides with significant elements that desperately want to fight, and police often do it while being called a bunch of names or threatened.

In Durham, a crowd gathered around 6 p.m. Monday and grew from 50 to more than 100 over two hours. It started with protesters sharing stories of personal experiences with racism, carrying signs, and chanting “No cops, no KKK, no facist USA.” This was all well within bounds of free speech and protest, the most egregious offense being some seriously Orwellian use of the English language: “We are going to find fighting avenues to be on the right side of history,” said the march’s organizer and emcee. “We are going to love like we mean it.”

Okay.

Then it moves into vandalism:

A ladder was brought out, and placed in the back of the pedestal. A protester climbed the ladder and slipped a yellow, bungie-like cord around the soldier’s head and arm. A group of people pulled the long yellow cord. Within seconds the soldier fell, the metal collapsing as the statute did a somersault against the stone pedestal. Protestors cheered and started to kick the crumpled mass.

Here’s how law enforcement reacted:

As the crowd moved toward the statue, members of the Durham County Sheriff’s Office videotaped the rally… The line of protesters walked back to the old courthouse. Some took photographs with the fallen statute. Sheriff’s officials continued to take video.

No arrests were made that night. What message was Durham sending? That the speech rights of this group of people extend to damaging public property in front of law enforcement with impunity? Which other laws would this group have been allowed to break? Which other groups might get such lenience?

How long before someone tests that boundary? We shouldn’t allow “righteous” protesters of Confederate monuments to lawlessly trash them with impunity because someone else who thinks they’re righteous could come along and use their righteousness as a reason to trash pretty much anything. Days later, after criticism of the department for inaction, the Durham sheriff’s office arrested one protester.

On the other hand, we have Seattle—a place, it must be stipulated, with a rich and troubled history of navigating the line between free speech and rioting, police protection and police overreach. In Seattle’s case, there was a gathering of Patriot Prayer, a pro-Trump group, and a gathering a counter-protesters and Antifa forces.

The two gatherings were planned before the violence in Charlottesville, and were held blocks apart, but police did not allow counter-protesters to march all the way to the pro-Trump gathering because they worried about “a small group within the larger march that were clearly, in my experience, clearly there for violence,” said Assistant Seattle Police Chief Steve Wilske.

“If I would have allowed that entire march to go there, there is no way I’m going to keep those people from fighting,” Wilske said. “And once that fight starts, you’re going to have, potentially have, Charlottesville. You’re going to have what happened in Portland in June. And I can’t.”

One Seattle city councilmember is questioning the decision, but Wilske was undeterred: “If I have to do that to keep people from getting hurt, then that’s my responsibility.”

At the end of the day, both groups had marched, with no property damage or injuries reported. Local press reported the “Solidarity Against Hate” marchers challenged the police line, a few threw fireworks at officers, and the police pepper-sprayed part of the crowd. Police made three arrests and confiscated several makeshift weapons.

Were both groups given pretty decent leeway to express themselves? Yes, although I understand the counter-protesters’ desire to get close to the other gathering to make their presence known. Local coverage and pictures of the pro-Trump event suggests plenty of counter-protesters made it to the park in which they were gathered, just not en masse, as an organized march.

But Seattle sent the message that law enforcement will take pretty reasonable measures to ensure that tense situations don’t explode into violent situations. That’s important to citizens attending the protest, and all those who call the city home. It’s a better message than Durham sent, where freedom of speech was protected, but the rule of law and protections against criminal action weren’t.

This Charlottesville Map Indicates Police Allowed Violence,"The availability of credible information has made it difficult to know what went wrong with the police response that failed to prevent rioting and murder in Charlottesville last weekend. We all know that the mainstream media is biased. One way to combat that bias is to check twice as many sources to tease out facts that the various sides inadvertently agree upon.

That begins to build a picture of what actually happened. Information coming out of Charlottesville is compromised. If you can’t trust the data going in, the data coming out is worthless. So I don’t know what happened and I don’t expect to find a credible answer soon.

Both sides came looking for a fight and got one. The police were judged marginally effective. However, partisans on both sides will blame the police to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions. The police will bow to their political masters, take their licks, and hope the price of their silence was worth it.

What the Permit Should Tell Us

Best I can tell, the Klu Klux Klan (KKK) had a permit to demonstrate at Charlottesville’s Lee Park for a specific period. Another crowd showed up to oppose the demonstration. The issuance of a permit represents a leg up for the police. They get to make rules, or they don’t issue the permit.

We don’t know what rules were made or what information the police had, but I would expect the following:

The number of KKK members expected to participate.

An estimate of the number of supporters.

An agreement from the organizers for a parking area far removed from the protest site. Arrangements would be made to transport KKK protesters and supporters to and from the site.

A limitation on acceptable and unacceptable items allowed at the protest site: no baseball bats, no poles on protest signs thicker than one-half inch, no pointed or metal-tipped poles. No chains, slingshots, prohibited knives, or weapons.

Police would provide an escort to enter and exit the site to minimize the chances of confrontation.

This is all long-established protocol for how to manage a demonstration. Law enforcement will typically assign assembly points and routes to the event. They try to make sure that the points are sufficiently removed from one another so the groups won’t reach critical mass and explode. The police line the routes to maintain peace along the way. There will always be rabble-rousers who try to disrupt the process.

The left-wing opposition group Antifa, and associated groups such as Black Lives Matter, did not have a permit. This means the police had no prior agreement with and very little control of left-wing protesters. Given prior examples of Antifa protests, law enforcement would have been justified in setting up a controlled area and an exclusionary zone. The exclusionary zone apparently was the curb line of E. Market Street, shared with the Lee Park. Since the only entrances to the park were along E. Market Street, then, confrontations were guaranteed.

What the Police Should Have Done

The police missed an opportunity by not setting an exclusionary zone for a one-block radius around the park. By exclusionary zone, I mean a no man’s land occupied by the police and cleared individuals, the press, and people whose intent is to join the rally. No hanging around outside, they are going in or leaving.

The purpose of the control area is to give law enforcement the opportunity to relieve the participants of baseball bats, two by fours, one and two-inch dowel rods affixed to signs, and slingshots, plus any garden-variety prohibited weapons. They can keep the sign. People armed in such a manner give up these implements, leave the area, or, depending on the nature of the item, face arrest.

Each group winds up at its assigned demonstration point, and they do their thing without interacting with one another. Protestors have a right to free speech, but that doesn’t mean that police have to provide the audience. The ultimate irony, of course, is Antifa complaining that their right to free speech was infringed while they engaged in a protest to deny another group the right to free speech.

Declaring civil disobedience is an admission that the protestor is going against established norms and may violate the law in doing so. It is an admission that the violator may be arrested and is willing to take that risk. It is not civil disobedience to beat somebody whose views you oppose about the head and shoulders while refraining from calling the person a “motherf-cker.” That activity is called aggravated assault and is a felony.

What the Crowd Is Comprised Of

Police and protestors know that estimates of crowd size are meaningless. I am not sure what the press knows. A protest crowd has four components without regard to the issue: The leader organizers, a relatively small cadre. They are committed to the cause. Then, more and more there are hired guns committed to whoever hires them, and they are geared towards violence.

Then there are the supporters, and they come in two flavors. There are the true believers, and the “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine” types. There are just so many causes and not enough time, what with soccer practice and the dog needing to visit the vet, so what’s an activist to do? Bundle. The “Save the Whales” folks agree to show up at the “Stop Autism in Dogs Demonstration” if the Stop the Autism in Dogs group can make the Save the Whales protest. Neither group has the least interest in a cause outside their interests, but numbers are numbers.

The vast majority of people who show up at demonstrations are the Me Toos. They don’t know what the cause happens to be and don’t care. They have been told, “Dude, there’s gonna be a killer band,” “Chicks dig guys who protest, maybe we can get laid.” They are curious and looking for entertainment. For most, assault is not entertaining.

One final component of the crowd are the opportunists. Mostly criminal in inclination, they go where large bodies of people are because you never know.

Now for the Critical Question

Question: How many protesters will stand and fight if not given an outlet to escape?

Answer: All of them.

Given the opportunity, at the first sign of trouble, most of the crowd will leave. This means an estimated crowd size of 4,000 dwindles to 400. Among the first to leave are the planners and organizers, leaving the mob without direction.

One of the key considerations in handling confrontations at protests is what to do when the party is over. The police may time the rallies so they end at different times and they can move the crowds out. With good prior planning, police move opposing sides off in different directions. Officers try to channel opposing groups away from each other. It is one thing to walk the gauntlet with 50 of your buds, but it’s something else entirely to do it alone.

Look at the picture above again. The police could have moved the KKK and supporters to the back of the park and loaded them on buses. Even without the buses, the KKK folks would have had a block-long head start. Instead, the Klan was pushed out onto E. Market Street, where Antifa was waiting. There seems to be some debate as to whether the rally was shut down early with an immediate order to vacate the premises. I don’t know. It seems at this point the cops just stood back and didn’t escort either group or attempt to direct their movement. And that is when everything went to hell.

What the Operations Order Would Reveal

Given the number of police agencies and officers involved, I would be interested in seeing the operations order. There are probably several hundred copies floating around. The operations order would lay out the chain of command and lines of communication. It would describe the overall operation, its goals, and contingency plans. It would define the area of operations. It would probably describe various triggering events. If this, then that, and so forth.

Another item of interest would be the recording and log of activities and events maintained in the command post. With information from those two sources, it would be possible to see how the actual events varied from the plan and who gave the order to deviate from the plan.

If what happened at Charlottesville was just bad luck and poor communication, then I would expect that some law enforcement elements would have stuck with the original plan while other elements implemented the new plan and charted a different course. But that didn’t happen.

Round up the usual suspects. While doing so, ask yourself: has there ever been a state police agency that would roll over so completely for a small-town mayor? (The answer is no.)

Paul Battaglia is a retired police officer who lives near in San Antonio, Texas. As a police officer, he spent 15 years assigned to narcotics, with an additional three years as a police academy coordinator. He developed and delivered training in officer survival, tactical operations for narcotics enforcement, SWAT, and a variety of search and seizure and investigative topics. After that, he spent 12 years in patrol.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/17/charlottesville-map-indicates-police-allowed-violence-either-accident-purposefully/,2017-08-17
There's No Evidence For Michael Bennett’s Claim Police Were Racist,"As the NFL kicks off another season this weekend, we’re reminded, yet again, the biggest storylines surrounding America’s most popular sport aren’t actually on the field.

Technically, attention will still direct itself onto the field—its sidelines—as certain players, some who’ve already declared their intentions of varying demonstrations, take up the cause Colin Kaepernick pioneered. Last year, the former 49ers quarterback sat during the national anthem. Then, after extreme backlash, Kaepernick opted to kneel in protest of police brutality towards African Americans and other minorities.

That cause, championed by Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett, has a new rallying cry thanks to… Michael Bennett. On Wednesday, Bennett claimed Las Vegas police officers handcuffed and detained him on August 27, without cause, outside of a casino where a shooting was believed to have taken place.

In Bennett’s statement, titled “Equality,” Bennett accused the police officers of using excessive force and wrote, “The officer’s excessive use of force was unbearable. I felt helpless as I lay there on the ground handcuffed facing the real-life threat of being killed. All I could think of was ‘I’m going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin color is somehow a threat.’ My life flashed before my eyes as I thought of my girls.”

Apparently another thought later crossed his mind: How this story fits neatly into his decision to kneel for the anthem. Now equipped with personal experience, Bennett vowed to continue Kaepernick’s protest this season. Additionally, Bennett said he had hired Oakland-based civil rights attorney John Burris to investigate the case.

But there’s one problem when a famous professional athlete takes on an entire profession and city’s police department: video. Once Bennett shared his story, and social justice warriors lapped it up without any proof, the Las Vegas Police Department began their own investigation, and the meager results so far contradict Bennett’s story.

What the Videos Show

On Thursday afternoon, LVPD’s labor union released a statement asking NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to “conduct an investigation, and take appropriate action, into Michael Bennett’s obvious false allegations against our officers.” The union said Bennett hid from officers behind a slot machine before bolting outside and hopping over a four-foot barrier wall, which could fairly be construed as suspicious behavior during an active-shooter scenario. Bennett allegedly continued to hide from officers there until they discovered him.

Once a story goes viral, and there’s video to accompany it, there’s no stopping it. This writer speaks from personal experience. Nothing can ruin a person, a story, or a false claim more than video. It’s a reality of a world of click-bait digital media. According to the LVPD, they have more than 120 clips of video of Bennett’s incident, which they promised to closely examine.

The union’s statement to Goodell concluded with, “Michael Bennett’s claim that our officers are racist is false and offensive to the men and women of law enforcement. We hope you will take appropriate action against Michael Bennett.”

Here’s what we saw in released footage so far, just a few of the 120 clips recorded: The LVPD body-camera footage shows many African-American casino patrons were in the officers’ vicinity. Thus, it’s difficult to imagine one person in that crowd being singled out solely for the color of his skin. In fact, Bennett’s attorney told Matt Markovitch of KOMO-TV that race wasn’t a factor in Bennett’s arrest but lack of probable cause was.

In a press conference, Las Vegas Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said “I see no evidence that race played a role in this incident.” Yet Bennett’s original tweeted statement centered on racial profiling as reason for detainment, saying Las Vegas police officers singled him out for “doing nothing more than simply being a black man at the wrong place at the wrong time.”

If police officers are responding to a possible shooter and detect suspicious activity from an individual, it’s not only natural, it’s part of their job to track down anyone acting erratically. Should police officers let anyone just run away from the scene of the crime if the person is not Caucasian?

What Bennett Says Versus What Police Say

Bennett’s story does afford plausibility. The arresting officer did not turn on his body-camera, so we have no idea what all was communicated to Bennett. Without that video, it’s hard to confirm or refute Bennett’s allegations that the officer “forcefully jammed his knee into his back.”

Bennett also claimed he was handcuffed so tightly his thumbs grew numb. It is not uncommon for officers to use force when detaining suspects, but the extent of what’s appropriate is difficult to determine without witnesses or other evidence. However, a main sticking point in Bennett’s allegations of excessive force is that the arresting officer held a gun to his head and threatened to blow it off. The LVPD statement did not deny Bennett’s gun to the head allegation. Yet, again, even if officers did use excessive force, so far there’s no evidence it was related to race.

McMahill informed the media the police held Bennett for 10 minutes. Bennett’s time in the cop car and treatment is what his attorney, Burris, said he intends on exploring through all evidence available. Burris told the Seattle Times that a lawsuit is “imminent, just not today.”

As a reporter with experience covering Bennett, it’s difficult to discredit his accusations. Bennett was vocal and bluntly honest with the media whether it came to his play, the Seahawks, or his views on life (both serious and zany). At 6’4 and 274 pounds, Bennett is a larger-than-life persona, both literally and figuratively. If even he would feel helpless in that situation, there’s no doubt we all would. Being held to the ground after fleeing for safety from a possible shooting is traumatic for anyone, including the strongest gladiators of our favorite sport.

But in today’s society so few people want to apply the same logic or understanding to law enforcement. Unlike our judicial system, the social media mob’s mentality is guilty before proven innocent, especially with police officers. The frequent assumption is that every cop racially profiles, and if someone tries to counter that argument he’ll hear some variation of “the police department will just try to protect its own.”

If civilians want “good” cops to step forward when a fellow cop acts violently or inappropriately, then they must also accept those same cops will come forward to defend their own when unjustly accused. This apparently is what the LVPD believes based on the evidence it has.

We Don’t Want Knee-Jerk Judgments Against Either Side

The hatred towards law enforcement that’s grown in our country is a sad phenomenon. The system isn’t perfect: Philando Castile and John Crawford’s deaths are proof of that. But how often do law enforcement critics bring up the fact that five police officers died in Dallas last year? Police officers can suffer gunshot wounds and other injuries just doing their job. Where’s the outrage then?

Officers see the athletes they help protect on game days kneeling to protest them.

Police put their lives at risk for salaries that dwarf in comparison to the million-dollar athletes or television personalities who scorn them. Don’t you think the officers of the LVPD would rather be in the safe, comfy confines of a studio? They would probably love to talk sports for a living with bank accounts incomprehensible to the average American.

But they don’t get that luxury. Instead, they come home after putting their lives in danger to hear talking heads condemning their very existence. Officers see the athletes they help protect on game days kneeling to protest them. Go ahead and point out the protests are just about the “bad” ones. But every man and woman wearing a uniform is forced to see it and be under suspicion by association.

In the end, we may never truly learn who was in the wrong between Bennett and the LVPD. Unfortunately, to many in the quick-to-judge crowd, it doesn’t matter. Innocent or not, those police officers never stood a chance. The vitriolic public perception of law enforcement is as great a problem facing our society as the racial inequities within our justice system. One fuels the other, and the only result is disparity and hatred.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/07/theres-no-evidence-back-michael-bennetts-claim-police-roughed-hes-black/,2017-09-07
5 Problems With The NFL’s National Anthem Protest,"At a Friday rally in Alabama, President Donald Trump criticized football players who protest during the national anthem:

Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b-tch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’ You know, some owner is going to do that. He’s going to say, ‘That guy that disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ And that owner, they don’t know it. They don’t know it. They’ll be the most popular person, for a week. They’ll be the most popular person in this country. Because that’s a total disrespect of our heritage, a total disrespect of everything we stand for. I know we have freedoms and we have freedom of choice, but it’s still disrespectful.

He went on to say that ratings are down because the game itself has gotten boring, but also because “When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they are playing our great national anthem.” He suggested that fans simply leave the stadium when this happens.

In response, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement that said, “Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.”

Then in a move that should have surprised no one, Sunday became a national anthem protest day around the league. Many players took a knee during the anthem, some stood with raised fists. Entire teams remained in their locker rooms during the national anthem. And Bills running back LeSean McCoy, who was on my fantasy football team years ago when I still cared about the NFL, took the opportunity to stretch out during the national anthem.

Here are five reasons the NFL anthem protests are not going as well as the media would like to think.

1. Vague And Unclear Protest Goals

One of the keys to a good protest is to have a clear goal. If the discussions on Sunday were any indication, nobody is entirely clear what is being protested when athletes kneel during the national anthem. CNN said yesterday’s display was about opposition to Trump:

The opening paragraph in the Los Angeles Times story on the protests said they were about “the relentless vortex of controversy that surrounds President Trump, as players from London to New England to Carson knelt or linked arms Sunday while others stayed in the locker room during the national anthem.” Later the story said the protests during the national anthem were meant to “draw attention to racism and social injustice.”

The national anthem protests began last year, before Donald Trump was elected the first time, when then-professional quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee for a variety of reasons.

Kaepernick, who has sat and knelt during the anthem, has said he refused to honor a song or ‘show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.’ He also referenced the shootings of black men by police as one of reasons for his stance.

As for the latter claim, Mary Katharine Ham noted on CNN yesterday, disapproval of Black Lives Matter has gone up from 20 percent in 2016 to nearly 60 percent in the August Harvard-Harris poll.

Even in Kaepernick’s lengthy press conference last year, it was a bit unclear what the goals of the protest action are, or what it would take to declare victory and cease protesting. At that press conference, Kaepernick unfortunately wore a T-shirt of photos commemorating Malcolm X meeting Fidel Castro. As the better half wrote last year:

The biggest problem here is that Kaepernick is seemingly unaware of Castro’s legacy. Aside from Castro dragooning and executing Christians and gays, Castro’s record on racial justice is decidedly not ‘woke’, as the Internet likes to say. While Cuba’s legacy of racism predates Castro, it’s safe to say overt racism against individuals of African ancestry there remains far more pronounced than it is in the United States. In fact, racism is kind of an unstated official policy.

In other Kaepernick fashion news, he also wore socks with pictures of pigs dressed like police officers. In any case, if the goal was an end to police brutality against black men, the movement seems to have gone off the rails a bit. Surely lack of awareness is not the problem regarding police officers and the killing of unarmed black men. What is the protest movement accomplishing other than increasing opposition to Black Lives Matter and bothering fans?

2. The NFL’s Utter Inconsistency

Goodell and NFL owners were adamant this weekend that players had the right to express themselves without fear of any retaliation. This even though there are rules that the NFL could apply to stop protests of the national anthem. Yet, as David Marcus wrote last year:

After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers in July, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society. When the Cowboys wanted to send the message that police officers should not be hunted and assassinated, the NFL gave a clear answer: no.

There were rules the NFL chose to apply to stop the wearing of decals to commemorate the murder of five Dallas police officers working to protect the people at an organized protest of police brutality.

The NFL fines players for dancing in the end zone. It threatens fines for 9/11 tributes. It shows leniency for other issues, such as domestic violence, but it needs to show more consistency about on-field behavior.

3. The Terms of Debate Couldn’t Be Worse For the NFL

The media were thrilled by the protests on Sunday, which they perceived to be against Trump. But the way many Americans viewed these protests was not nearly so favorable as it was to people in New York and DC newsrooms.

Some of the national anthem protesters took their knees before a game in London, on foreign soil. The players followed that by standing for “God Save The Queen.” If you don’t know what’s problematic with that show of respect for a foreign country’s anthem while protesting your own on foreign soil, I doubt it could be explained to you.

For many people, in part because of the vagueness of the protest goals, these national anthem knees simply come off like people being jerks about the national anthem because they don’t like Trump. Which, it turns out, is not a great way to get the public on one’s side.

As president-elect, Trump proposed jail for flag-burners. We barely remember the outrage cycle that ensued on the part of the media, because in fact punishment for flag burning is far more popular than people in newsrooms realize. In his rally, Trump positioned himself, and his supporters, on the side of the flag and patriotism. This wasn’t difficult for him to do, because many Americans have been viewing these as protests against a country they love.

For the NFL owners to take the bait and up the ante was not the wisest response to Trump’s rhetoric on Friday.

4. The NFL Can’t Afford the Struggle

The NFL is facing a ratings slide, with much less fan engagement than they’d like. While many of the league’s problems have nothing to do with politics, the anthem protests are causing some problems, according to a July CBS Sports story:

According to a recent survey from J.D. Power, national anthem protests that originated with Colin Kaepernick led a list of reasons people tuned out of NFL games last season. The poll consisted of 9,200 people who attended a football, basketball or hockey game, and asked them if they tuned into fewer games and why. Per the poll, 26 percent of viewers cited the protests as the reason. Coming in second, 24 percent said that it was because of the league’s off-field image issues, such as domestic abuse, and general game delays, such as penalties. Twenty percent said that it was because of excessive commercials…

The league also faces problems with the high levels of brain injury players face:

Frontline reported on numbers from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University, where researchers studied the brains of 165 people who played football at the high school, college, or professional level. They found evidence of CTE in 131 of them—79 percent. Of the brains studied, 91 of them belonged to former NFL players, and 87 of those 91 (96 percent) had signs of CTE.

5. The Media Fan Flames, Stupidly

Another problem for the NFL is that a fight between celebrity football players and a celebrity president is ratings gold. So expect nonstop coverage that inflames the issue in a way that benefits the activist extremes and the president, but few other people.

Journalists went to their favorite Trump line of attack:

Yes, because if there is one thing that we know about Trump, it’s that he never criticizes any white people. He is not known for insulting Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, or Megyn Kelly. Nosiree.

There are so many legitimate lines of critique against President Trump, including that he sure seems to pick culture war battles when he’s failing politically. Or that it’s untoward for a president to weigh in on employment and speech issues, though recently we seem to have presidents who do just that. Even on that score, the media tend to be ignorant of any problem associated with the immediate past president, as some of these exchanges indicated:

Imagine a very religious group of Catholic nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor had to engage in a costly seven-year legal battle to keep the Obama administration from forcing them to pay for abortions against their conscience or pay fines that would end their work. Imagine that. It shouldn’t be difficult to imagine since they’re still waging this battle on account of onerous regulatory mandates from the Obama administration. Of course, this violation of First Amendment freedoms didn’t include a cuss word, so I guess it’s less newsworthy.

The president is exploiting fan disappointment with the NFL and a general public dissatisfaction with divisive protests that lack clear goals. Despite the fame and wealth of players and owners, the NFL is not as well positioned here as its media defenders seem to think.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/25/5-problems-with-the-nfls-national-anthem-protest/,2017-09-25
France’s Terrorism-Prompted Restrictions On Civil Liberties Make Sense,"Although it didn’t receive a lot of press, on Sunday in the main train station of the southern French city of Marseille, a man who reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” stabbed one young woman in the stomach and slit the throat of another before being shot by police. Both the victims died. ISIS claimed responsibility.

France hasn’t had a large-scale ISIS attack since last summer, but it has experienced numerous small-scale attacks like this. These smaller attacks often result in no casualties and, because they frequently involve knives and cars rather than bombs and guns, receive relatively little media attention here in the United States. In France and across the European continent, such attacks are becoming almost quotidian.

Yet it’s important not to forget that regardless of how poorly equipped or trained the men and women who launch a terrorist attack might be, it is their intention to do as much damage as possible. It’s also crucial to remember that the Muslim followers of ISIS and its religious ideology aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. That’s something the French government, at least, isn’t having any trouble remembering.

Just two days after the Marseille knife attack, the French parliament assembled to vote on a new and controversial counter-terrorism bill proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron. The fast-tracked bill is meant to provide a way for France to end a state of emergency that was first put into place in November 2015, after the attack on the Bataclan music venue in Paris. The state of emergency has since been extended five times.

A Permanent State of Emergency

Under the state of emergency, police have the ability to search homes and properties without a warrant, put individuals under house arrest, impose curfew in certain areas, or forbid gatherings. All this can be done without judicial oversight, in the name of national security.

Macron has promised to end the state of emergency by passing legislation for a new counter-terrorism law. But that bill, which the lower house of parliament passed Tuesday, has received serious criticism. The problem is that the law would simply shift many of the temporary provisions of the state of emergency into permanent ones, making the move largely one of optics rather than substance.

The Human Rights Watch argues the new law will perpetuate the human rights abuses it says have occurred throughout the current state of emergency. United Nations human rights experts say that normalizing emergency powers “has grave consequences for the integrity of rights protection in France, both within and beyond the context of counter-terrorism.”

What specifically worries these groups is the possibility that French security forces will disproportionately and unfairly profile and target Muslims in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks. That’s because the law would allow the police to assign areas as security zones if authorities perceive a threat, then limit movement within and through that area, as well as carry out searches. Since many of France’s Muslims live in concentrated neighborhoods, especially on the outskirts of cities, it would be easy for police to clamp down on them as it sees fit. What’s more, French police could shut down mosques if they think religious leaders there are inciting violence or encouraging terrorism.

A Perpetual State of War

But that is not, apparently, how French lawmakers by-and-large view the matter. To them, France is under attack and must protect itself. France’s Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told France Inter radio, “We are still in a state of war. We have foiled numerous attacks since the start of the year that would have led to many deaths.” As if to prove his point, police arrested five men in Paris on Tuesday who are suspected of being involved in a failed attempt to detonate a bomb in a swanky apartment building in the 16th arrondissement.

The way Macron and his government see things, the emergency powers are what allowed for preventing another large-scale attack. Without them, France would find itself more bloodied than it already is.

Moreover, France’s problem can’t be solved by travel restrictions because it is largely homegrown. The country is home to the largest Muslim population in Europe, mostly from its former colonies in North Africa, and the relationship between French Muslims and the rest of France is strained, to say the least. Both because of their ostracization and self-imposed segregation, an alarming number of French Muslims have proven open or vulnerable to the Islamic State’s violent mission to attack to the West.

Macron’s new legislation certainly does give the police sweeping powers that could easily be abused, and given human nature, most certainly will be. But French leaders finds themselves in a terrible position. They know that the majority of security threats come from sections of the Muslim population and from some, although not all, of its mosques. France has to be able to address that risk through increased scrutiny and the power to intervene when necessary. At the same time, France is supposed to be a liberal democracy that protects basic civil rights.

Safety Versus Freedom

So how does a nation like France balance a desire to be free with a desire to be safe? It’s the same question that many Americans are asking in the days following the Las Vegas shooting—is our safety worth stripping Americans of their Second Amendment rights? Right now, many on the Left are saying “yes,” as they have been for years. It’s also a question America has had to deal with on surveillance in the years following 9/11 and the 2001 Patriot Act.

But when it comes to Muslims, terrorism, and national security, the United States and France have had very different reactions. While France is moving toward stricter scrutiny of mosques and increased police powers, the dominant U.S. narrative, especially in the media, is that Muslims shouldn’t be scrutinized any more than any other religion is for national security.

We saw this phenomenon manifest itself in the uproar over the Trump administration’s series of travel bans that targeted Muslim-majority countries. It’s also why you often see grandmothers and small children being thoroughly patted down at the airport, as if they represent just as much of a security risk as any other demographic. For better or worse, the United States has thus far resisted the urge to engage in racial profiling, no matter the security risks.

But the United States is not France. It doesn’t have the same perspective or the same experiences (nor, obviously, the same laws or constitutional protections). France has also borne the brunt of ISIS attacks in Europe since the group emerged on the international scene in 2015, and has seen more than 240 people killed by the group’s followers on French soil. Every time a new attack takes place, accusations fly about how the security forces should have seen this coming.

That’s what Macron is trying to fix with this new counter-terrorism bill. The fact is, in the age of ISIS the constant threat of terrorist attacks, both large and small, has become the new reality for Europe. Americans might express their disapproval of the strict measures Macron is proposing, but it’s worth remembering that we in the United States don’t face the steady, seemingly endless stream of attacks that Europeans do today.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/04/dont-quick-condemn-frances-terrorism-prompted-restrictions-civil-liberties/,2017-10-04
Supreme Court Considers If Police Can Arrest People On Assumptions,"The U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) is set to hear several blockbuster cases this fall that they pushed off following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, knowing the court would likely be deadlocked. They will hear a case involving whether government can search cell phone records, and the well-known case involving a rare blend of questions about free speech and free exercise of religion, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission.

SCOTUS is hearing another case today that’s not infamous but still important, as it involves the complex and often-misinterpreted Fourth Amendment: District of Columbia v. Wesby.

The case goes something like this: Nearly ten years ago a bunch of friends had a bangin’ party in a Washington DC neighborhood—except the owner of the home wasn’t there. As the party became raucous, police arrived and, although they found women scantily clad and offering “lap dances” to the smell of marijuana, nobody could determine whether these folks had actually been invited into the home. SCOTUS blog reports:

Some of the partygoers told the officers that they had been invited to the house, while others told the officers that they had received permission to be there from a woman whose name was either ‘Peaches’ or ‘Tasty.’ But ‘Peaches’ gave the officers conflicting stories about whether she had permission from the owner to use the house. When police officers eventually talked to the owner, he confirmed that he had not authorized anyone, including ‘Peaches,’ to be at his house.

(Surely this is the first SCOTUS case involving a woman named “Peaches.” If only Justice Scalia were alive to inject his incisive humor.)

The officers assumed the partygoers were trespassing and arrested based on that assumption. Even though they were right, the officers technically didn’t have that piece of information at the time of the arrest. So the partygoers later went to district court arguing police never had probable cause to arrest them. The court agreed and the police had to pay attorneys’ fees. The case has since worked its way up to the Supreme Court.

With partygoers insisting police didn’t have probable cause to arrest them and police claiming they did and that, anyway, the police can’t be sued (a.k.a. “qualified immunity”), this is a fascinating case involving the Fourth Amendment. That amendment reads: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”

SCOTUS blog concludes:

The partygoers may see the case as straightforward, but it’s not clear that the Supreme Court (at least so far) agrees. The justices considered the case at nine consecutive conferences before finally granting review. That kind of extended consideration often signals either that the court is preparing to summarily reverse (that is, reverse without briefing on the merits or oral argument) the lower court’s ruling or that a justice is dissenting from the denial of review. We likely never know what was going on behind the scenes, but we will learn a lot more about the justices’ current views after the oral argument.

With a new justice on the bench, Neil Gorsuch, it’s difficult to conjecture what the justices will rule on this unique case. Even if Scalia remained on the bench, this would have posed an interesting intersection for him on privacy rights and security issues.

Last November at the Federalist Society Convention in Washington DC, an annual conference for typically more “conservative” lawyers, the group honored Scalia’s legal legacy. One panel was dedicated to his views on national security law, an irony because he had written few opinions on the topic. However, the Fourth Amendment came up repeatedly.

Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, was on the panel. She observed, “The Justice had a solicitude toward privacy rights. He was considered a friend to liberals and libertarians on privacy. In the Kyllo case he said the Fourth Amendment protected people’s privacy. He emerged as a champion of privacy rights. He might have been concerned about the NSA’s surveillance programs.”

She continued later, “In United States v. Jones he relied on the narrow ground that attaching GPS was an invasion of property. However, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t use the word ‘privacy.’ He also didn’t like squishy standards; he liked rules. It lends itself to results-driven analysis.”

It will be interesting to see how the new court rules on issues as important as privacy and probable cause.

Why Aren’t NFL Players Kneeling Over This Pennsylvania Cop Shooting?,"On November 17, a police officer was killed during a routine traffic stop in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. His name was Brian Shaw, and he was only 25 years old.

According to reports, the suspect, 29-year-old Rahmael Sal Holt, fled his car after he was pulled over, and shot Shaw during the subsequent chase. Officials said Shaw did not appear to have fired his gun, while Holt fired at least six times, landing at least once in Shaw’s chest. Shaw lay in the street gasping for air before dying in a hospital that night. After several days on the lam, Holt was captured and arrested November 21 with Shaw’s handcuffs.

CAPTURED: Rahmael Holt was arrested in Hazelwood this morning and placed in Officer Shaw's handcuffs. #wtae pic.twitter.com/4kjxd6efWY — Kelly Brennan (@kellybrennan412) November 21, 2017

No NFL players kneeled on Sunday to protest the brutality that occurred to Shaw. No national cable channels dedicated expansive coverage of the incident, if some even included it at all. It required a Google search to learn about the kind-hearted residents who lined the streets of the small Pennsylvania town holding American flags while firefighters stood in uniform paying their respects during the funeral procession.

This young man received an outpouring of love from his neighbors and community, but he deserved respect from all of us, too. So many times, we hear about Black Lives Matter and other protesters advocating for young men like Alton Sterling, who was shot and killed in Louisiana last summer, or Philando Castile, who suffered the same fate when a Minnesota police officer shot him in July. These were tragic events that understandably reverberated and divided communities by race—especially when the Caucasian officers in question were not charged and acquitted, respectively.

But the narrative that cops are always the “bad guys,” deserving condemnation and shame across the board, is simply not true. Some cops abuse their power. Others use it to do their duty. Like the five Dallas police officers killed in 2016, Shaw put on a uniform to serve and protect his community. Yet the NFL forbade the Cowboys from wearing special decals on their helmets to honor the fallen Dallas officers, while allowing its players to continue protesting law enforcement.

No superstar athlete has spoken out about Shaw’s murder, although he too was once a football player, at Slippery Rock University. Every Sunday, Shaw likely watched a sport he loved only to see a plethora of NFL players kneeling against men and women wearing the same uniform as him.

But that’s forgotten in an anti-police narrative en vogue among many. It’s no wonder there’s an absence of coverage over Shaw, when police fatality statistics across the country are hardly ever discussed—a shame, given the recent uptick.

A 2016 report from the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund found a 56 percent increase in firearm-related deaths of police officers in the previous year. Sixty-four officers were killed in firearm-related incidents in 2016, compared to 41 the previous year. It was the highest tally of firearms-related deaths on record since 2011. So far in 2017, 115 police officers have fallen, and 41 of those deaths were caused by gunfire.

Are these statistics ever mentioned during the debate over America’s justice system? For every Colin Kaepernick GQ cover or celebrity rant on social media, there are officers like Shaw, who do not display an abuse of power in the discharge of their duties. So often during the NFL anthem protests, you hear players vow it has nothing to do with the U.S. military or police (although a lot of Americans are getting just that message). But it seems they have no problem disrespecting the officers who are paid to ensure players get from their cars to the stadium and back to the parking lot safe and sound. Our justice system isn’t perfect, and we should work to redress all injustices no matter their victims’ identities, but that shouldn’t detract from the many police officers who do their dangerous jobs well.

Men like Shaw risk their lives to do right by their community. Men and women leave their loved ones every morning, not sure if they might come back again. For that, we should take a little time to realize how worthy of respect many police officers are, and temper our complaints about isolated injustices with recognizing they don’t represent the norm, and that injustice the other way exists, too.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/22/arent-nfl-players-kneeling-pennsylvania-cop-shooting/,2017-11-22
Alton Sterling's Family To Reconcile With Widows Of Slain Police Officers,"Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, was shot and killed by two white police officers who had pinned him down outside of a convenience store on July 5, 2016, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The deadly encounter was captured in a cellphone video that shocked the nation and spurred protests across the country. The next day, Philando Castile, a 32-year-old black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota. His death was captured in a Facebook live video.

Their deaths prompted demonstrations across the nation, including a protest organized by Black Lives Matter in Dallas, Texas, where 12 police officers were shot and five were killed by a gunman perched atop a parking garage. The gunman, who was shot and killed by officers after hours of negotiations, said that he “wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.”

Several days later, a 29-year-old gunman ambushed and killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana after penning a three-page-long suicide note explaining that he intended to kill “bad cops as well as good cops,” and police officers who were “black or white … as long as they had a badge.”

Today, the widows of two Baton Rouge police officers who were slain in the aftermath of Sterling’s death will meet and have a sit-down- conversation with Andricka Williams, the mother of three of Alton Sterling’s children in Dallas, Texas.

The conversation between Williams and Tonja Garafola, the widow of East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, and Trenisha Jackson, the widow of Baton Rouge Police Officer Montrell Jackson, is part of a larger event organized by the Urban Specialists to mark what would have been Martin Luther King Jr.’s 89th birthday.

Dr. Bernice King, the daughter of the civil rights leader who was slain 50 years ago, will also attend the event, as well as Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.

The reconciliation will be moderated by Pastor Omar Jahwar, who told the Federalist he’s hoping this event will trigger a nationwide source correction and change the way we talk about race and police brutality.

“People get overwhelmed by senseless violence and think they can’t fix it, but they can reconcile and heal and forgive,” Jahwar said. “What they think is they’re the only ones dealing with it, when you see others who are fighting through it, it gives you certain assurance that you’re not alone. That gives you strength to keep fighting.”

Could The Police Legally Do No Wrong In The Parkland Shooting?,"The revelation that the police officer assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School resigned under investigation for failing to enter the building while a shooter killed 17 people is the latest shock in this tragic story. Those outraged may wonder whether the survivors might be able to sue the former officer or the Sheriff’s office.

The answer, even after an investigation establishes a fuller picture of what occurred during the shooting, is unclear. And one reason for that murkiness is something called the public duty doctrine, which limits the government’s responsibility to protect individual citizens.

The public duty rule is grounded in the principle that the duty of the government entity to preserve the well-being of the community is owed to the public at large rather than to specific members of the community. As a result, the doctrine holds local government entities owe no duty to individual members of the general public to provide adequate government services, such as police and fire protection.

To the layperson, this might sound like sovereign immunity, the idea that the King can do no wrong. Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases where courts (including Florida courts) have confused them. But they are historically and conceptually different.

Consider a typical negligence lawsuit, such as a medical malpractice case. To establish negligence, a plaintiff must show the defendant, maybe a doctor, owed the plaintiff a legal duty, such as a reasonable standard of health care under the circumstances, and that the failure to meet that standard caused damages to the plaintiff.

So the the plaintiff has to prove a special duty — some sort of relationship between the plaintiff and

When considering such a claim against a government officer or agency, the public duty doctrine establishes that the plaintiff must prove a special duty. In the case of the Parkland shooting, that would mean the school would have to prove the officer assigned owed the students and faculty there a special duty, above and beyond what the government owes the public generally.

The doctrine may seem more reasonable if you consider situations other than this particular school shooting. For example, if I am mugged, can I sue the police for failing to catch the mugger for the value of what was stolen? Or if the local police all respond to a report of a school shooting and someone across town makes a 911 call regarding a home invasion, can she sue the police if she is raped due to their failure to respond?

Given these types of concerns, the public duty doctrine is the prevailing law in the vast majority of states, although it’s not followed in jurisdictions of seven states — Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Kansas.

The Florida Supreme Court has provided a “rough” guide to the type of activities that either support or don’t support the recognition of a duty of care between a government actor and an alleged tort victim. The court established two general areas in which the government would owe a general public duty as opposed to a special duty to an individual. The first is in legislative, permitting, licensing and executive officer functions, and the second is in the enforcement of laws and the protection of the public safety. The response to a school shooting arguably falls within the second category, which would suggest that the police did not owe a special duty to those inside the school. But the matter may not be quite so clear cut.

In a prior Florida case, the state’s supreme court ruled that Sheriff’s deputies who responded to a 911 call undertook to determine a woman’s safety, thereby assuming a duty of care, and could be sued for negligently increasing the risk of harm that the woman faced by failing to summon an ambulance. In that case, the officers affirmatively rejected the 911 caller’s suggestion that the woman might be in a diabetic coma and assured concerned third parties that she was simply asleep and did not need medical attention. (The woman died several days later without ever regaining consciousness.)

In the case of this Parkland shooting, it will be important to discover what is meant by the officer being “assigned” to the school. He reportedly had been a school resource officer at Stoneman Douglas since 2009. An investigation may support the argument that the police had undertaken a special duty to students, faculty and staff at the school.

If such a duty were found to exist (and a breach of that duty contributing to the deaths were established), any potential government defendant still may be able to argue sovereign immunity as a defense. (This highlights the difference between the public duty doctrine, which addresses the elements a plaintiff must establish to show a valid claim, and sovereign immunity, which would be a potential defense to that claim.) The issue might then become whether that immunity was waived based upon a wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.

For the sake of completeness, in addition to noting that I am not licensed to practice law in Florida and that none of this should be considered legal advice, lawyers representing the survivors would also probably consider a federal civil rights action. However, the case law in this area similarly tends to revolve around the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.

Officer’s Hesitation To Stop Shooting Fits A Pattern Of Police Cowardice,"My uncle John is a retired Los Angeles police officer. He doesn’t like to talk about it, but if I buy him enough drinks, he’ll tell how he captured an armed bad guy on the streets of LA, although my uncle was off-duty and unarmed.

The story involves car chases, foot chases, and a shotgun—and the guy holding it wasn’t my uncle. Fortunately, everything worked out that day, and a dangerous criminal was off the streets because my uncle risked his life—off the clock.

I think about my Uncle John every time I read an all-too-frequent report like this one: “The armed school resource officer assigned to protect students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took a defensive position outside the school and did not enter the building while the shooter was killing students and teachers inside [all emphasis added] with an AR-15 assault-style rifle, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Thursday.”

Most Americans are astonished and outraged to hear this. How can a police officer—how can any person—stand around listening to innocent kids being shot?

Most Americans don’t know this happens all the time. Remember the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando?

As the largest mass shooting [at that time] in modern U.S. history began to unfold, an off-duty police officer working at a gay nightclub exchanged gunfire with the suspect. But three hours passed before one of the nation’s most revered SWAT teams stormed the building and brought the attack that left 49 people and the gunman dead to an end.

The ISIS-wannabe was in a shoot-out with a cop before he even got in the building. But for some reason, the cop didn’t follow him in. Shots fired inside. Nothing. Then SWAT waited outside, even as shots rang out from inside the building.

Remember Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut? “Newtown officers arrived at the school while the gunman was still shooting but did not enter the building for more than five minutes, according to a prosecutor’s report.” The state police conducted a comprehensive review of events that day, but “didn’t interview any Newtown police officers who were the first responders on the scene.” Newtown police didn’t do their own after-action report, either. What’s to review, right?

This list goes on and on. Up in Canada during the 1989 massacres at Ecole Polytechnique: “As officers stood outside in the snow, [the shooter] moved through the corridors looking for more women to kill.” Out west in Columbine, as in Orlando, the cops exchanged fire with the killers, then waited outside as 10 people were gunned down. The police waited outside. Listening.

The sinking feeling we have as we read these stories isn’t anger. It’s betrayal. Our police are supposed to be better than that. We honor them, we tell our kids to look up to them, we buy them lunch, donate to their charities, we believe in them. That’s because we believe they’ve made a commitment to endanger their own lives to protect ours.

Only not everyone is in on the deal, apparently. Over the years as a radio talk host, I’ve had a dozen or so callers claiming to be cops who angrily insisted that, as one put it “Our first job is to make sure we go home to our families safe at night.”

My response was to suggest that, somewhere, there was a mall missing a security guard. For real cops, if someone is going to get shot—either an innocent civilian or themselves—their job is to take that bullet if they absolutely must.

So why do so many cops stand outside and do nothing while kids are being killed? Well, cowardice, for one thing. No, not all cops are cowards, that’s ridiculous. I know from personal experience that’s not true. But they’re not all heroes, either.

Ask yourself this: Could you stand outside and listen to high school kids get shot and do nothing? Particularly if you had a gun and the training to use it? Wouldn’t every cell in your body scream for you to run inside and kill that SOB?

So why do good cops wait? Training. It’s part of a tactical approach currently debated by police departments across the country. Before Columbine, everyone pretty much waited: Set up a perimeter, wait for SWAT, go in with mass firepower and a strategy to reduce civilian casualties. That doesn’t work if all the civilians are already dead.

So the strategy changed—or was supposed to. But as we’ve seen again and again, in some places, it hasn’t. This brings up the conversation nobody wants to have: It’s a lot easier to police good people than bad ones.

Sheriff Scott Israel, whose department had dozens of encounters with the Parkland shooter before the massacre but failed to take action, was on CNN insisting that the solution to gun crime is out of his hands. So he wants to get guns out of yours. He’s demanding restrictions on the gun rights of lawful citizens.

He couldn’t figure out how to get the information about the Parkland psycho into the background-check system, which would have stopped an actual bad guy from legally buying a gun. Instead, he wants to stop everyone. Why? Because law-abiding citizens abide by the law. We do what they’re told. We’re easy to police. So his failures are apparently on us to solve by giving up our rights.

The same with suburban teenagers posting crazy stuff on the Internet. Israel also wants police to have the power to detain people without a warrant, take them in against their will, and give them a government -authorized evaluation of some kind—all based on a police officer’s opinion that you’ve posted something “disturbing” on the web. Hey, there are plenty of angst-ridden teen boys out there to roust, and cops like Israel are more than happy to do it.

Scaring dopey teens and banning AR-15s is easy. Following up on truly dangerous people, building a case about their mental health, getting the evidence a judge needs to act—that’s hard work. So is going into a building where shots are being fired. Cops aren’t heroes for doing “easy.” They are heroes—and most of them are—for doing the hard stuff.

Parkland: Pay For Garbage Government While Doing Its Job Ourselves,"Each day Americans wake up to hear new revelations of government incompetence that enabled the Parkland, Florida school shooting. First it was the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s failure to follow existing protocols to investigate a highly detailed tip that the shooter was planning and had the means to do exactly what he did. The FBI and local police received at least four separate tips warning of the shooters’ plans and means, and local police had received 45 calls summoning them to the family’s home since 2008.

Then we learned of the police officer — the only person initially onsite able to return the shooter’s deadly force and tasked by his salary-paying community with doing precisely that — hesitated for approximately four minutes to enter the high school as students lay dying. Then local sources told reporters three other Broward County police officers joined that onsite officer in hiding behind their vehicles until police from another jurisdiction showed up. Reports say the Broward County police didn’t even follow the others inside.

Then it was that police didn’t know they were watching the wrong security tape, putting them off the shooter’s whereabouts by 20 minutes, leaving a mass murderer to endanger more people longer. To add insult to literal injury, the hesitating onsite school police officer, Scot Peterson, was allowed to resign and will receive a lifetime public pension of approximately $60,000 a year plus benefits.

This kind of government employee incompetence with horrific consequences is by no means limited to the Parkland killings. Instead, it is endemic to U.S. government at all levels, with consequences big and small. For example, my colleague Rachel Stoltzfoos reports that government incompetence failed to prevent a slew of recent high-profile mass killings:

Law enforcement protocols already in place also might have stopped the Texas church shooting in 2017, and the Charleston church shooting in 2015. The gunman who carried out the Texas massacre had a history of domestic violence that should have prevented him from legally buying a gun. But the Air Force conceded after the shooting it had failed to enter his name into the federal database that would have prevented his gun purchase. Similarly, paperwork and communication fumbles between the FBI and local law enforcement resulted in a background check error that allowed Dylann Roof to buy a gun in South Carolina, which he later used to massacre congregants at a Charleston church.

If government agencies can’t follow existing violence-prevention laws and procedures, how can they be trusted to effectively implement additional rules that wild-eyed partisans insist will “do something” to prevent mass murder?

This point contains two related threads: U.S. government forces citizens to support a layer of incompetent fat that impedes our best interests; and government failures force us into a burdened mode of self-government. We have to both pay for government to not perform basic functions like protect citizens from criminals and carry out justice, and accomplish those same ends ourselves if we want them done at all.

As Charles Murray says, government has become an “insurable hazard,” but only to the small proportion of Americans with the requisite money or connections to secure such insurance. The rest of us are sitting ducks. And we know it.

Some Police Aren’t Doing the Job Their Benefits Reward

On the premise that police put themselves at risk of maiming and death on our behalf, we compensate that with gold-plated benefits, early retirements, and huge family compensation packages. Yet what we too often get in exchange are not people who put themselves at the risk they signed on to carry and have accepted high compensation for, but officers whose attitude is more “Let me know when the danger is over and then we’ll come out of our cars to clean up the carnage.”

Now, I understand that attitude in situations like gang or drug warfare, where there are no innocent combatants, but not in active-shooter-massacres-innocents scenarios like Parkland. As Michael Graham points out, the “protect police before civilians” approach is an active policy in some locales. It logically leads to more spirited citizens demanding the power to handle government-dominated activities themselves, such as the power to protect themselves on the spot with concealed-carry licenses.

I think self-defense is every citizen’s responsibility, not exclusively for police and military, but as William Voegeli points out in “Pity Party,” it’s strikingly strange that people who think defense is exclusively government’s job apparently don’t care about making sure government is effective at it, or just about any other functions they want government running. Government ineffectiveness deeply undermines their public case for government-run everything. Americans are noticing that, and responding by opting out of the system they are forced nevertheless to support. Applications for concealed-carry permits and gun-training registrations spike after just about every publicized shooting.

Government Is Failing At Its Largest Pursuits

It’s not just in self-defense, either. Homeschooling increased 62 percent from 2003 to 2012, the most recent years numbers are available. Over the past decade, enrollment in public charter schools — choice schools that can be run by local boards of parents and community leaders instead of school districts — has tripled. Enrollment in private school choice programs has skyrocketed in the past decade, and seven in ten parents say their first choice is not their kids’ assigned public school.

Or look at health care. Sales of short-term health insurance plans have jumped, because those are exempt from burdensome Obamacare (and other) mandates that spike costs. Since Obamacare passed, the number of people who have chosen health-cost-sharing over insurance has doubled. That’s basically an arrangement where participants pool their money to cover members’ health expenses, which are not 100 percent guaranteed to be paid. They’re opting out of a system government ruined.

Military and police, education, and health care by far dominate government spending, and in all these sectors the half of Americans who do pay taxes sponsor inept systems that don’t serve us well. We haven’t even mentioned the myriad ways in which the U.S. military has gone off-mission from securing clear national defense interests, such as sending people on junkets in Germany in exchange for free college tuition, spending billions meddling in random countries, and boosting the egos of social activists who want to normalize mental illness.

We haven’t talked immigration policy, which in practice often preferences noncitizens above citizens (how many Americans have legally secured free public education in a foreign country?). We haven’t talked how Congress reinforced intelligence agencies’ spying power despite revelations indicating those agencies used it to advance partisan politics at the expense of Americans’ constitutional rights. Neither have we mentioned Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, where today’s productive people are forced to fund other people’s social welfare that will implode before our chance to “benefit” from their substandard offerings.

We pay both directly, through these transfer programs, and indirectly, in their market-warping effects. For example, Medicaid or Medicare typically doesn’t pay full price for care despite hiking the price of that care through artificially inflating demand, so doctors raise prices on everybody else to make that money back to stay in business. The people who pay their way plus everybody else’s get stuck with an escalating cycle of inflated prices and worsening care, exemplified by Obamacare’s death spiral. Gee, thanks, government!

All this makes it no mystery that public trust in government remains near record historical lows. Government does not deserve our trust. It fails at making websites, it fails at educating children, it fails at increasing access to quality health care, it fails to use public resources on the public contributing those resources, and, worst of all, it fails to keep disturbed people from murdering children.

While it’s disgusting we have to shoulder these important responsibilities while paying for a massive apparatus of people who are supposed to do the exact same things yet consistently fail, it’s also a push in the direction of self-government, a uniquely American habit in sore need of exercise. We should all be managing our our own health care, preparing for our own old age, and assuming responsibility for our children’s education. We should also be ready to defend ourselves and others until the police can show up. This is what self-government means.

The Vicious Cycle of Downplayed Failure

The real indignity is having to pay for and wade through a bureaucracy intent on undermining our self-government so they can live off our productivity while not upholding their end of our social compact. When we do their jobs ourselves, it highlights their incompetence and our lack of need for their systems. That erodes the justification for their sinecures and power to frustrate our choices. Proving our capacity to run our own lives is an existential threat to their way of life.

This is why bureaucracies almost always respond as Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has to revelations of his department’s incompetence: “Of course I won’t resign…I’ve given amazing leadership to this agency.” Instead he argues for depriving citizens of the most efficient means to fight back against criminals his deputies won’t fight themselves. In other words, he wants to take away the workarounds Americans have for his corrupt and ineptly run system.

Americans clued in to our government’s persistent betrayals of its promises — a group that expands with every major bureaucratic failure such as Parkland — will only respond by gripping their guns, kids, and cash-pay doctors tighter. Instead of heeding the people’s frustration, the bureaucrats and their sympathizers and enablers have largely reacted with more dramatic demonization. Instead, they need to do what will end this escalating cycle: admit failure, drop fantastical promises of utopia on earth, and slowly but surely establish more-limited public services that actually materialize.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/27/parkland-underscores-americans-pay-garbage-government-job/,2018-02-27
New School Policing Info Marks Scott Israel An Ayn Rand Villain,"The shooting in Parkland, Florida, was supposed to be yet another morality tale about the evils of private gun ownership, showing us why we need to surrender our weapons to the state. It has ended up being a massive story about government incompetence and indifference, centering around Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. It just goes to show you. The moment I write something nice about the office of sheriff, a sheriff has to go and bring discredit to that office.

But here’s the aspect of the aspect of the story that stands out for me. It’s not just that Israel’s record of incompetence keeps piling up. It’s that he responds to the resulting disaster by asking for more power.

Literally, those are his exact words. In his first press conference after the shooting, he called for more police authority to put people in jail over “disturbing” social media posts, declaring, “We need to have the power.” He also asked for more money for sheriff’s departments.

As more information has come out, we have discovered that both local and national law enforcement received abundant tips about the shooter and failed to follow up on them or effectively use any of the power they already have. Yet they say they still they need more. At that notorious CNN town hall last week, Israel doubled down on that.

The Broward Sheriff’s Office, we received tips, numerous tips on this killer. We—some we answered by phone, some were out of state, some we went out there. Our command staffer is actually looking into some of these tips to make sure we did everything right. If we made a mistake, I’ll act accordingly and deal with it. The person responsible is the agent or the detective, or the person who received the tip and didn’t exercise their due diligence and took it where they needed to be. All that being said, what I’m asking the lawmakers to give police all over this country is more power.

He reiterated the point later on, insisting that “the power of police is not as great as it should be.”

You know who Israel reminds me of? He reminds me of Wesley Mouch, one of the villains in Ayn Rand’s novel “Atlas Shrugged,” the classic dissection of the big government mindset. Mouch is a DC hanger-on who fails upward into the position of chief economic planner, and every time his blundering interventions lead to disaster, he has the same response: “I need wider powers.” It’s his signature line.

In other news, I occasionally get people who tell me that Rand’s novels are not realistic. So why do people in real life keep auditioning for roles in it? I’m going to start calling Israel “Sheriff Wesley Mouch.”

The Parkland shooting was a failure of government at every level. The FBI received a tip that the shooter was photographing himself clothed in the garb of an ISIS fighter—and failed to follow up. The shooter was well known to local police to be mentally unstable and repeatedly threatening to kill people, and they pretty much ignored the problem. And that was all before the actual attack occurred and sheriff’s deputies waited outside rather than confronting the shooter.

But wait, it gets worse. Sarah Rumpf just did some invaluable reporting on Broward County’s slipshod approach to law enforcement in the schools. What she found is a scheme Israel pushed to reduce juvenile crime statistics in Broward County through the simple expedient of not arresting juveniles when they commit crimes. The theory is that going easy on minor and non-violent offenses would pull kids out of the “school-to-prison pipeline” and keep them from being permanently held back by youthful indiscretions.

In practice, it functions like broken windows policing in reverse. The idea behind the broken windows approach is that if you crack down on minor crimes, criminals are deterred from committing bigger ones. They are not emboldened by the “broken windows” of a neighborhood that has been abandoned by the police. Sheriff Wesley Mouch’s approach in Broward sent the opposite message, both to juvenile delinquents and to his own deputies, that anything goes because the police don’t really want to enforce the law.

This is the context in which the Parkland shooter repeatedly came into contact with the police and was simply bounced around inside the school system. As Rumpf sums it up:

Sheriff Israel said that he instructed BSO deputies to issue juvenile civil citations, not arrests; The BCSD’s own written policy encouraged handling even criminal activity ‘outside the criminal justice system’; The BCSD’s own written policy did not actually require arrests, even for felonies and serious threats to school safety; Cruz’s behavior included repeated disruptive behavior, violent outbursts, threats, and physical assaults on other students; and Cruz was never expelled or apparently arrested for this behavior.

During Israel’s tenure in office, she calculates, juvenile arrests have decreased by nearly half—but there is no evidence that actual violent crimes by juveniles have decreased. They’re just not being arrested for it. So Israel needs “wider powers”—and, of course, more money from the government—so he can ignore more young criminals.

The power of government is limited partly because it should be limited to protect our freedom, and partly because government cannot centrally plan evil and insanity any more than it can centrally plan the economy. The FBI receives more than a million tips a year and isn’t always going to be able to winnow through them to determine which are real threats. A lot of people are constant troublemakers but never quite do anything for which they can be locked up or deprived of their civil rights.

Uses of force are complex and confusing events, and even armed and trained police can be paralyzed by fear or befuddled by the fog of war. All of that is true before we take into account the levels of incompetence and corruption that are normal for government employees with powerful unions and untouchable pensions.

All of this makes the case for why we need private ownership of firearms so we can defend ourselves. Because we sure don’t want to have to depend for our safety entirely on Sheriff Wesley Mouch.

4 Things We Can All Do To Stop The Next Shooting,"“Did you see that story on the news today?” my dad asked when I was about 11 years old. “A man caught his wife and kids trying to leave him. He came home, and they were packing up their things. He went in the house and got his gun. First, he shot the kids, then he shot the wife, and then he shot himself. They all died. You won’t ever leave me, will you?”

This was how my dad ensured my silence and submission. And my dad knew how to use his gun too. He proved that when he shot a neighbor kid’s dog right in front of me, from thirty feet away, just for the fun of it. I can still hear the dog’s yowls. They weren’t yelps, like you’d expect from a dog. They were screeches of pain and terror.

About a decade later, my dad once again threatened to murder my entire family. He didn’t threaten frequently, but I can recall a handful of occasions. He usually posed the threats as a joke or cloaked them in the context of a news story. This time, I was engaged to be married. I feared that the stressor of losing control of me might be the straw that broke the demon’s back. I stole his gun. I hid it, unloaded and wrapped in a towel, in a box of chintzy craft supplies, knitting, and fashion accessories I’d accrued as a teenager. It was the last place he’d look.

I left the ammo in his dresser drawer. It was my way of mocking him, as if to say, “I’ve taken your power, but left the bullets so you can play marbles with them.”

I never told the police about my dad’s abuse; his sexual perversion, murderous threats, or violent assaults. I loved my dad. I feared my dad. I still do. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I also didn’t want to risk being stuck in the same house with him if the police failed to arrest him. As a survivor of 20 years of domestic violence, I fully support my right as a mother to arm and defend myself should anyone ever threaten me or my family again.

My dad is not a school shooter. As far as I’m aware, he’s never shot anyone, although there is a family story that he once stabbed his sister in the hand. Nevertheless, he could have become a shooter and I didn’t tell a soul. I am certain that he is just one among thousands of violent offenders who slip under the radar because no one ever reports them. I suspect, like me, most don’t report because they both love and fear their abuser. No one wants to believe that their dad, brother, son, mother, daughter, or friend, could be the next monster on the five o’clock news.

Peter Langman, Ph.D., is a respected authority on mass shooters, particularly youth and school shooters. He has conducted extensive research and published works regarding the psychology of adolescent murderers. In a harrowing and fascinating study, “Rampage Shooters: A Typology,” Langman divides school shooters into three basic categories: Traumatized, Psychotic, and Psychopathic.

Traumatized Shooters come from dysfunctional families. Each of these shooters in his study experienced physical or sexual abuse. They all had at least one parent who abused drugs or alcohol or who had a criminal history. “Among the traumatized shooters … all three had father-figures who engaged in criminal behavior involving the misuse of firearms,” notes Langman in his report. “In two of these cases, the fathers engaged in armed stand-offs with police.”

Psychotic Shooters come from intact families with no history of abuse, parental addiction, or incarceration. They exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia or a schizotypal personality disorder such as delusional paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and auditory hallucinations. “The psychotic shooters were misfits in their own families,” Langman states, “and the differences between them and their siblings were obvious to their parents and teachers.”

Psychopathic Shooters also tend to come from intact families with no significant dysfunction. These shooters exhibit narcissism, sadistic behavior, little to no empathy, and a lack of conscience. Langman notes that, “the psychopathic shooters successfully recruited followers to join them in their attacks … Thus, the presence of peer support may have contributed to their decision to commit a school shooting.”

Langman’s career has involved researching manifold cases, but this specific paper focuses on 10 school shooters who were all teenagers, with the exception of one, who was 23. The youngest was only 11. Together, these young shooters murdered 69 people and injured 92 between 1997 and 2007.

For any person, abused or not, to progress to a state in which they are capable of such profound cruelty, requires a process of moral and emotional deterioration which would be marked by increasingly aberrant behavior and attitudes. How did people miss the red flags that preceded these heinous crimes? How does a person grow violently abusive without someone noticing or intervening? How can a teenager manifest schizophrenic or sociopathic behaviors, yet no one sees?

Based on my experience with an abusive dad, I would suggest to you that many people saw.

In the case of the Parkland school shooter, there were 23 police reports warning the Broward County Sheriff’s Department that he was a dangerous threat. These reports include accounts of him hitting his adoptive mother, throwing her against a wall, fighting with his brother, exhibiting suicidal behavior, and threatening to shoot up the school on social media. There were several occasions where it seems he should have been hospitalized or arrested, but nothing was done. At one point, he called the police to tell them that he was deeply troubled. One woman even reported him to the FBI, stating that he was “going to explode,” and her worry about him “getting into a school and just shooting the place up.”

Stories are emerging of an angry and disturbed teen who held a gun to the head of his mother and brother; who assaulted several people, including the son of Roxanne Deschamps, the woman who took care of him and his brother following the death of their adoptive mother in November, 2017. In a chilling 911 call, Deschamps warned police that she believed he might shoot her and her family. Nevertheless, the police did not intervene. Notes were taken, reports were logged, but no apparent effort was made to provide for his mental health or the safety of those around him.

This is every abuse victim’s worst fear: That they’ll report abuse, but the police will do nothing, and they’ll be left alone with an abuser who knows that they reported them. Unfortunately, this seems to be exactly what happened in Florida. Broward County Sheriff’s Department has demonstrated to the nation that being disbelieved or abandoned by law enforcement is a reasonable fear. Abuse reports across the U.S. will now likely decrease as gun purchases for self-defense skyrocket.

While the shooter is an abuser, it’s safe to say he falls under Langman’s “traumatized” category, if not others. His biological parents died, he was adopted, and then his adoptive parents died. According to police reports, he has a history of being bullied, bullying others, and fighting. Whether he suffers a schizotypal illness or psychopathic dysfunction is something for his doctors to decide. While reports assert he was diagnosed with disorders such as ADHD and OCD, these are not the type of diagnosis that would or should ever raise red flags. On the other hand, his suicidal behavior and murderous threats should have warranted medical evaluation.

But this isn’t the first time that school shooters have been enabled by neglectful family, friends, educators, physicians, or law enforcement officers. The following is a list of school shooters, most of whom were not included in Langman’s paper.

A 23-year-old killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 using two semi-automatic pistols. An investigative panel later criticized educators and medical professionals who failed to notice his deteriorating mental health. It also noted gaps in Virginia’s mental health system and gun laws.

In 2005, a teenager murdered nine people, including his grandfather, before committing suicide at Red Lake Senior High School in Minnesota. The shooter was born into a broken home. His mother was an alcoholic who abused him. His father had a criminal history and committed suicide by shooting himself during a police standoff.

A six-year-old brought a gun to Buell Elementary School in 2000 and killed his classmate, Kayla Rolland. “I don’t like you,” he told her before he shot her dead. The boy’s father was in prison for dealing cocaine. He had been living with his abusive, drug addicted mother before moving into his uncle’s crack house. Just a few weeks before he murdered Rolland, the boy had gotten into trouble at school for bullying and hitting other students, including for stabbing one little girl with a pencil.

Another teenager killed two and injured 13 at Santana High School in California in 2001. He had allegedly been bullied and abused by classmates. On two occasions he told people about his plan to “pull a Columbine,” but no one ever reported his threats to police.

In 2003, a teenager murdered 15-year-old Seth Bartell and 17-year-old Aaron Rollins. During his trial, three mental health experts diagnosed him with schizophrenia, while others diagnosed major depression and emerging personality disorder. The families of the victims later sued the school district, the principal, and the shooter’s family, alleging that they knew what he was planning during the days preceding his crimes. The lawsuit was settled out of court for $200,000.

Yet another teenager murdered three of his fellow students and seriously injured two others in 2012 at Chardon High School in Ohio. He had a criminal history including domestic violence and disorderly conduct, and posted death threats on social media accounts prior to the shooting.

Also in 2012, a 20-year-old murdered 20 children between six and seven years of age at Sandy Hook elementary school. The shooter had been diagnosed with multiple mental health issues. A report from the Office of the Child Advocate noted his “severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems … combined with an atypical preoccupation with violence… [and] access to deadly weapons … proved a recipe for mass murder.”

“It is fair to surmise that, had Lanza’s mental illness been adequately treated in the last years of his life, one predisposing factor to the tragedy of Sandy Hook might have been mitigated,” the report concluded.

Each and every one of these perpetrators manifested traumatized, psychotic, or psychopathic behavior in the weeks, months, and years leading up to their crimes. And each one was surrounded by people who failed to report or intervene when they witnessed disturbing red flags. Whether the people surrounding them were parents who were negligent, absent, or abusive; teachers, counselors, and school officials who ignored warning signs; law enforcement who failed to press charges or follow up on reports; or bystanders who failed to notice or report troubling behavior and threats, the people who surrounded these shooters enabled tragedy by either neglecting to speak or failing to act.

The Parkland shooter’s friends and acquaintances had the courage to report him to the authorities. They recognized the danger and they did exactly what they should have done. The fact that law enforcement failed them so miserably is something that will haunt every abuse victim who is thinking about picking up the phone. The damage that the FBI and Broward County Sheriff’s Office have done to the psyche of crime witnesses and victims across the nation through this catastrophic lapse is incalculable.

The words of Sheriff Israel and his repeated denial of blame for the inaction of his department, typifies an unfortunate culture of irresponsibility. “Deputies make mistakes. Police officers make mistakes. We all make mistakes,” Israel told Jake Tapper on CNN. “But it’s not the responsibility of the general or the president, if you have a deserter … Jake, I can only take responsibility for what I knew about. I exercised my due diligence. I have given amazing leadership to this agency.”

How many times have we seen stories of teens eating Tide Pods, but instead of asking where their parents are, people blamed Tide for looking too much like candy? How many times have we seen people blaming television, video games, or social media for the bad behavior of children, rather than examining that child’s parental figures or educational environment?

Most people don’t want to intervene into the mess of another person’s life. Most of us are happy gossiping and gawking at celebrities, but don’t even know our next-door-neighbor’s name. Most of us, when we see evidence of familial or mental dysfunction, think, “Oh well. Somebody else will do something about it. It’s not my responsibility or place, and I’m sure everything will turn out fine.”

But too often, we see that everything does not turn out fine. If we want to stop the next school shooter, there are a few practical things we must do.

1. Foster a culture that of emotional investment in relationships

We must foster a culture where people are aware and involved in each other’s lives. We must branch beyond Facebook and Twitter and talk to friends face to face. When we’re involved with each other on a personal level, we’re more likely to notice when things aren’t going well. We’ll see the black eye, the distracted stare, and hear the private worries of a stressed mind. People facing struggles will be more likely and better able to seek help, and children being neglected will be less likely to fall through the cracks. This is one area where small family-oriented churches play a vital role in keeping our culture emotionally healthy and physically safe.

2. Reestablish and reinforce a healthy family ideal

A large percentage of the violence in America would vanish within a decade if we focused on eliminating child abuse, child neglect, and domestic violence. Broken homes lead to broken communities, broken culture, and a broken nation. If we heal the family, we can fix the future. A large percentage of school shooters and violent criminals in general, report having had dysfunctional childhoods.

3. Diligently prosecute criminals

We must enforce existing laws that combat crimes, such as child abuse laws and the unlawful possession of guns. With few exceptions, it is illegal for a person convicted of a felony (such as domestic violence or drug possession) to purchase a gun. If criminals are prosecuted for their crimes, and entered into the national database, it will become much more difficult for them to acquire guns. The recent school shooting in Parkland could possibly have been averted had the shooter been prosecuted for domestic violence or assault. Had he been convicted, he would never have been able to purchase a gun.

4. Take care of the weak and the sick

We must make sure that people suffering from mental illness and emotional challenges receive the care they need. When a teenager calls the police to tell them he’s disturbed, that teenager should never be ignored. We must maintain a system that efficiently and comprehensively addresses the needs of people exhibiting depressive, delusional, psychotic, or psychopathic behavior. This is vital for their own happiness and health, as well as for the safety of our communities.

There is no question that every criminal owns complete responsibility for his or her actions. However, we as a society must also take responsibility for protecting each other, supporting one another, and providing for the very weakest and underserved among us. Our boys and girls deserve safe schools. Our kids deserve whole families. Our young adults deserve mental health care. Our teenagers deserve our love. We must promote a culture that fosters strong families, reinforces healthy marriages, nurtures tightly knit communities, encourages involvement in church and other familial organizations, treats individuals as dignified and valuable, and supports stay-at-home parenting and involved moms and dads.

We need to get back to the basics and love our neighbor. That is how we stop the next school shooter.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/01/4-things-learned-abusive-father-can-stop-next-shooting/,2018-03-01
"MSU Students Are Right To Oppose Spencer, But Their Method Is Wrong","More than 500 protesters shouted “Nazis, go home” and “F-ck the police” outside Richard Spencer’s speech on Michigan State University’s campus Monday. Their motivation is sound, but their method is faulty.

With faces covered by bandanas and combat boots on their feet, many of the protesters seemed primed for violence. Police in riot gear had to escort individual speech attendees into the building, crouched around them to protect them from the rowdy crowd. Every time a cluster of police would appear with an attendee nestled in the middle, a mass of screaming protesters would surge forward, only stopping at the line of riot officers. Some protesters would hurl rocks and other items at the groups as they hurried away. Occasionally protesters would confront the lines of police, spitting in their faces and asking who they served.

By the end of the protest, MSU Police had made 25 arrests, ranging from misdemeanors to felonies. Some involved weapons.

Richard Spencer says terrible things, but people who want to hear him speak shouldn’t have to wade through a mob to do so. These protesters — in all their sign-wielding, “f-ck the police”-chanting, Nazi-chasing glory — have ultimately created a third group of people. They’re not with Spencer, but they’re not with the protesters, either.

One example is Daniel Bailo, 31, who stood alone about a block away from the protest by several police cars. Bailo, a self-declared libertarian, didn’t know it was necessary to have a ticket to attend the event and was unable to enter. He said he was standing by the police cars because he didn’t feel it was safe to stand by the protesters. Since he was dressed in khaki pants and had fair skin and cropped hair, he suspected the protesters mistook him for a follower of Spencer.

“I wanted to see who actually came to these events,” Bailo said. “I’d love to be in there to ask a legitimate question.”

Bailo had been standing outside for more than 40 minutes, waiting for his sister to come get him. Protesters passing by hurled insults at him, admonishing him for standing by the police.

“There’s swarms of people who hate anyone who looks like me,” Bailo said.

Bailo’s hesitation to even be near the protesters not only shows the breakdown in discourse, but is an indicator of a third group: The group that would possibly join the protesters if they curbed their violence and kept their anger directed at the actual subject.

This is the group that values hearing opposing ideas, even if only to understand how to better argue against them. This group understands that being willing to hear the other side does not necessarily mean they agree with it.

Encouraging conversation and exposure to opposing ideas is important to the university environment, and cussing someone out or calling them names is not an argument. Protesting a speaker shows dissatisfaction, but chasing attendees only bolsters their narrative by victimizing them. And screaming in the faces of police officers, who are there to protect both protesters and attendees, only isolates those who value that protection.

The protesters at MSU had momentum behind them. Some had even travelled from out of state. Their movement was well-organized and had a noble cause. But by creating a violent atmosphere, they exclude people from that cause, hinder actual conversation, and paint themselves as out-of-control children.

If these protesters want to be taken seriously by the third group, they must make more efforts to curb their violence, properly direct their anger, and fight with arguments, not screaming matches. It is not enough to just be angry or to wave signs. Protesters must be willing to engage in actual debate and to value those who believe in exposure to a variety of ideas.

Keep the motivation, change the method. Then we’ll talk.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/06/msu-students-are-right-to-oppose-spencer-but-their-method-is-wrong/,2018-03-06
Five Questions On The Eric Greitens Indictment That Must Be Answered,"Three members of the Duke lacrosse team were accused of rape in 2006. Tried in the court of public opinion and hung out to dry by their university, the boys were later declared completely innocent. After the fact, it was called a “tragic rush to accuse,” and it left the boys’ reputations ruined, a prosecutor disbarred and jailed, and a country reckoning with how it fell for the narrative the media pushed.

It’s worth keeping that case in mind as another graduate of Duke, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, stands in the crosshairs of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner. Greitens was indicted for felony invasion of privacy, in a case with dynamics that seem strikingly similar to the Duke lacrosse case — a prosecutor who may have brought an indictment based more on politics than facts, and a public that may be judging too quickly.

It is my personal opinion that Gardner may be guilty of malpractice and malfeasance on par with the Duke lacrosse case, but with potential to do far greater harm to our nation. Her misconduct is of such a magnitude that she should be investigated and possibly disbarred. If she is found to be guilty of malfeasance, like the infamous prosecutor in the Duke rape case, she too should face criminal charges.

I know Gov. Greitens. I wrote a review for his book, and as a fellow military officer I developed a deep admiration for him. I co-presented with him at a school safety conference in Missouri. I also train police in all 50 states, and I have provided training for all federal law enforcement agencies. My books are required reading in many federal and local law enforcement academies. I have had articles published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Civil Policy and many leading law enforcement journals, and I have been inducted as a “Life Diplomate” by the American Board for Certification in Homeland Security, and a “Life Member” of the American College of Forensic Examiners Institute. From all these perspectives — as a fellow military officer, a law enforcement trainer, and an American citizen — I am simply outraged by what appears to be partisan political bias and egregious injustice represented by this prosecution.

Five questions about the legitimacy of this case demand an answer.

1. Where is the police report?

Our legal system typically works like this: someone commits a crime against someone else. The victim calls the police, who file a report and conduct an investigation. A prosecutor uses the police documents to get an indictment, and a trial begins.

That’s how the system is supposed to work. But in this case, the indictment came down without a police report. It came without a full investigation. And — astonishingly — it came without a victim seeking justice. We know, from prior reporting, that the person who the Circuit Attorney has alleged is the victim never went to the police and never brought an action against Greitens. Indeed, her only complaint has been that this case was brought into the public to begin with. She asked for privacy, and the prosecutor gave her a circus.

Remember how this case first came to light: An aggrieved ex-husband recorded the victim without her consent or knowledge. A television station, Missouri’s KMOV, had shabby enough editorial standards that they chose to run that recording on the nightly news, even as other news organizations passed on it. And that, it turns out, is all that was used by the prosecutor to bring a charge: a secret recording by an angry ex-husband, and a news report.

That’s hardly the stuff of which felony indictments should be made.

2. Where is the evidence?

Gardner’s allegation depends on one question: did Greitens take a compromising photo of the alleged victim in the spring of 2015 and transmit it? Through feints and hints in the media, the prosecution claimed to have such a photo. Some in the media believed them. Not so. Based on discovery delivered to the defense just a few days ago, the prosecution was forced to admit that it has no photo. The damning piece of evidence — the keystone for their entire case — doesn’t exist.

So what other evidence do they have? None. Yes, you read that correctly: There is no other evidence in their possession. The prosecution admitted as much in testimony before the judge this past week. They pleaded with the judge to allow their office to let them have the summer to “gather the evidence.”

Sorry, but Gardner has it backwards. Evidence is supposed to lead to an indictment, not the other way around.

3. Why did the FBI, the U.S. Attorney, and the police refuse to look into this case?

In words she must surely want to take back, the spokesman for Gardner’s office admitted to the St. Louis Post Dispatch, when asked about other law enforcement agencies who looked at this case, “The police, the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office declined to investigate for various reasons.”

That’s telling: The indictment and takedown of a governor is a big deal for any law enforcement agency. And yet no one bit. Gardner shopped this case to other agencies, and those agencies saw no evidence of a crime and decided not to investigate.

That’s also important because those institutions, particularly the U.S. Attorney and the FBI, are responsible for dealing with public corruption. In fact, they have a whole unit devoted to just that. Had there been evidence to suggest a crime by a high state official, surely they would have brought action. That none of them have is an important signal.

4. What’s the deal with the private investigators?

For reasons unknown, Gardner’s office did not use police detectives or even its own office investigators to look into the Governor’s actions. That’s highly unusual. Standard operating procedure for a public prosecutor is to use public resources to conduct an investigation. What Gardner did instead was pay a Michigan-based firm $10,000 to come to Missouri and look into the matter.

There are a few troubling elements to this. First, why an out-of-state firm? Surely there are Missouri-based private investigators who could have been contracted to do this work just as well. Second, were these individuals sworn in? That’s done when using private investigators in this sort of action; it ensures that the people doing the question-asking bear a responsibility to the court and to the law. Third, who was paying them? If taxpayer dollars were paid to these individuals, the public has a right to know. And if they were paid for with private funds, that’s an even bigger red flag.

Finally, why did those investigators travel to Jefferson City, the state Capitol, to talk to politicians? The investigators were first introduced to the public because politicians in the state’s Capitol admitted that they had spoken to them. That begs, even screams, the question: What would politicians in Jefferson City have to say about the facts of a felony indictment about an incident that took place three years ago in St. Louis, before the governor was even in office? These politicians had nothing to do with this case, and what’s worse, many of them have already revealed their biases against Greitens.

Who these investigators are, what they were doing, how they were paid, and why they were used in the first place are all important questions. Already a complaint has been filed about this matter from the association that oversees private investigations in Missouri. Hopefully that complaint yields the answers that haven’t yet been delivered by Gardner.

5. Why did the prosecution want so badly to delay the trial until the fall?

Here’s a final and critical question: Why is the prosecution dragging its feet on the trial date? Just this past week, they asked the judge to delay the trial for several months. One likely answer: They just aren’t ready for trial. As mentioned above, they have plainly admitted they need time to gather the evidence and make an actual case against Greitens.

But the real reason may be more nefarious. The prosecution specifically asked the judge to delay the trial date until just before the mid-term elections on November 6th. Why does that matter? Because it means that Democrats running for office throughout Missouri will be able to use the trial to campaign, fundraise, and win votes. As any Democrat knows, dragging this news on through the summer could pay huge political dividends. As an elected Democrat, Gardner surely knows that.

Thankfully, Greitens attorneys reminded the court that the right to a speedy trial is enshrined in our legal system. The judge denied the prosecution’s request, and thus, denied them the political hay they hoped to make.

These five questions matter.

Had they been asked in a rigorous way about the Duke lacrosse case, those young men might have been spared the humiliating, expensive, and unfair treatment they endured. Once accused of rape, a cloud of suspicion forever hangs above their heads, no matter what announcements or restitutions are made after the fact. That case still angers many people — and with good reason.

Let’s also remember: Someone did go to prison in the Duke lacrosse case. The prosecutor, Mike Nifong. Disbarred and jailed, he was also slapped with a multi-million dollar civil suit. So clear were his political motives, so aggressive was his pushing of a narrative in the media, that nothing could save him once it turned out the whole story was fabricated.

The Duke case teaches a vital lesson for the Greitens case: In the rush to judge a governor by a scandal, let’s not lose sight of the facts. Or in this case the complete lack of facts. It is vital that sober-minded people — in the media, law enforcement, and in the legal profession — continue to ask these questions. I believe that the answers could demonstrate a level of partisan character assassination that would enrage any citizen who believes in our legal system and our way of life.

One public safety official has described this case as simply “nuts” and “unlike anything I’ve ever seen in all my years of law enforcement.” If Gardner is successful in harming a state governor with what turns out to be a malicious, politically motivated prosecution, then every politician and all American citizens should fear the harm that can be done to our nation and to our way of life by such “weaponized” prosecutors with a politically-motivated agenda of prosecution and persecution of elected officials.

Why The Greitens Prosecutor Could Be The One Who Ends Up In Jail,"It didn’t take long for the wheels to start coming off the wagon of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s prosecution of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens.

An indictment with dubious origins and few facts has led to a trial with almost unbelievable moments of legal comedy. There was the initial hearing, when the prosecution admitted to the judge that they don’t have evidence to win the trial. Then there the moment when the prosecutors had to tell the defense that they didn’t have the photo that is supposedly the reason for the indictment in the first place.

And last, but most certainly not least, there was the moment when the prosecution allegedly broke the law by bringing on a prosecutor who was serving elsewhere as a criminal defense attorney. Yep, that’s a crime in the state of Missouri, and the prosecution allegedly committed it. Whoops.

It’s been my experience, after decades in law enforcement, that prosecutors tend to know the difference between what is and is not a crime. Most of the time, that is. In the case of Kim Gardner, I’ll admit: I’m not sure she does. Because in her action against Greitens, she appears to have missed the boat on what a crime is. In this case, she has no victim, very little evidence, no legal standing — and given all that, almost no hope of conviction. The slipshod work by the prosecution led one high-level member of law enforcement in the state of Missouri to call this “a clown show prosecution,” and that opinion is widely shared in legal and law enforcement circles in Missouri.

Obviously, Gardner probably didn’t think it would go this way. She was probably thinking this case against a high-profile, popular, sitting Republican Governor would make her name. Now it might ruin her career. Here’s why: It’s almost certain, at this point, that the case will either be thrown out by the judge or that the governor will be found innocent. But there might be more fallout to come — for Gardner, that is. What if the Greitens team files a civil suit against Gardner, one that could cost her millions in damages? What if citizens in the city of St. Louis file complaints with the police or Missouri’s attorney general about Gardner’s conduct, leading to a criminal investigation? Ironically, a case that began on illegitimate grounds could end with the quite-legitimate investigation of the prosecutor who started it.

Five new facts have emerged in the course of the trial that point to this being a real possibility. Together, they tell the story of a seemingly malicious and reckless prosecution driven by politics, ignorance, and ego, rather than a pursuit of justice.

1. It appears that Gardner began preparing the paperwork for the indictment prior to conducting any investigation.

Take a look at the bottom right hand corner of the indictment Gardner filed in this case. Notice the date: 12/22/2017.

That appears to be the date on which this document was first created. And it’s an interesting timestamp. Why? Because according to a letter released by the circuit attorney’s office, Gardner did not launch her investigation of Greitens until Jan. 11, 2018.

That means the indictment paperwork was apparently begun by the circuit attorney’s office a full 20 days before that office publicly became involved in this case. In other words, Gardner (or someone on her team) began writing out an indictment document before evidence of a crime was ever brought forward, before her office conducted any kind of inquiry, and before a grand jury ever sat. You don’t need a law degree to be bothered by this: Why would you prepare an indictment about a crime weeks before investigating that crime?

Answer: You wouldn’t. Unless of course the evidence didn’t matter to you, because you were just looking for any crime that fit and any jury that would indict.

Now, Gardner might claim this date screwup was a simple administrative oversight, a mere clerical error. If that’s the case, it’s just as troubling: Who makes mistakes like that when they charge a sitting governor with a felony? Did Gardner’s office just boot up a computer and decide to grab whatever indictment popped up most recently? And why not double-check a document like that before submitting it? What other “mistakes” of this kind have been made during the course of her investigation and indictment? Or worse: What mistakes has Gardner made prosecuting other cases, where the stakes for the people involved are just as significant?

Getting an explanation for this “12/22/2017” date is important. It seems Gardner was either plotting this indictment since late December, prior to gathering any evidence, or she and her team have been careless, reckless, and flippant about the documents and procedures involved in something as serious as charging the state’s leading official with a crime. Either possibility is damning.

2. Gardner allegedly broke the law in the course of her prosecution.

According to Missouri law, a prosecutor in the state cannot also serve as a criminal defense attorney. It’s a section of the law that Gardner would have done well to read twice before inviting Professor Ronald Sullivan of Harvard University to join her prosecutorial team. Greitens’ lawyers allege in a motion to disqualify Sullivan that when she offered, and he signed, a $12,000 per month contract to join her prosecution team, Sullivan committed a misdemeanor offense — and Gardner became party to a crime.

Gardner’s spokeswoman has rejected the allegation, claiming it’s legal because Sullivan does not have any pending litigation against the state of Missouri, but there’s really very little room for gray area here: Sullivan allegedly committed a crime, and his boss, Gardner, likely should have known better. She’s a prosecutor, one of the leading law enforcement officials in the city of St. Louis.

There’s another issue with the hiring of Sullivan to assist the prosecution, according to the motion filed by Greitens’ lawyers. They claim the deal Sullivan struck with Gardner allows him to hire whoever he wants to assist him, and that those people can be paid for with private funds. The way Gardner set this up, Greitens’ political opponents can apparently pay to prosecute him. In other words, the contract between Gardner and Sullivan essentially “privatizes” prosecution. We now have a bizarre case of what appears to be a weaponized and privatized prosecutor, a potential abuse of authority that should deeply concern all citizens.

There is a reason Missouri doesn’t allow this kind of thing: because it’s flat-out wrong. Our system of justice depends on public prosecutors, paid for by public funds, with their work, their methods, their sources, and their funding made public for all to see. The fact that Sullivan was apparently given such wide latitude to use private money to assist the prosecution — and the fact that he was brought aboard in the first place — represents a threat to the legitimacy of the judicial system.

3. Gardner’s assistant prosecutor allegedly misled the grand jury about the indictment.

Already in this case, the prosecution has struggled to show evidence of a crime. They have to depend on the testimony of an aggrieved ex-husband and a copy of a secretly recorded audio tape that ex-husband made — a taping done without the alleged victim’s consent or knowledge. That’s basically all they’ve got.

And that might explain why, during the grand jury proceedings, Gardner’s assistant prosecutor, Robert Steele, allegedly misled the grand jury to get them to indict the governor. That’s right: He gave a “false and misleading” statement about the statute the governor is alleged to have violated, according to Greitens’ defense lawyers. And he allegedly gave it in order to make the grand jury believe that a crime had been committed.

The defense’s opening two sentences in a recent motion make it plain what can happen if a prosecutor gives a misleading statement to a grand jury: “There are only a few actions by a prosecutor in presenting her case to a grand jury which can result in dismissal of the indictment. Offering misleading legal instructions is one of them.”

4. Gardner’s investigators were under FBI investigation.

A note to prosecutors: Beware the company you keep.

In my prior piece about this case, I covered the utter strangeness of a prosecutor using out-of-state private investigators to conduct an investigation of a public official. As it turns out, I was only scratching the surface. The out-of-state private investigators Gardner hired were led by a man who was once under FBI investigation himself. You couldn’t make this up if you tried: The private investigator, William Don Tisaby, worked for the FBI when he was accused of bigamy, and what’s worse, he allegedly lied to the FBI about it.

It was already odd to have a private investigative firm looking into a governor. Their work, as has been reported, was sloppy and irregular for a case like this. They weren’t allowed to write down any of the facts they found, and they were paid sums of money well above-and-beyond what a police officer would make for the same work. Now you add to that the fact that the investigators were being investigated, and you have another supporting fact for the countersuit that could await Gardner at the conclusion of this case.

5. Even the chief of police of St. Louis is demanding answers.

Another tip for prosecutors: Don’t pick a fight with the people who arrest the criminals you’re supposed to prosecute.

Gardner has developed a negative reputation among police officers in St. Louis. She’s looked the other way on cases into which they’ve poured time and energy; and she’s gone after police officers with more aggressiveness than she’s gone after killers and thieves.

That might explain why the new police chief in St. Louis, John Hayden, was so quick to point out to the press that the police had no involvement in the Greitens case. Not only did they not investigate, but the chief took issue with Gardner’s suggestion that the police had been asked to and didn’t: “It makes me frustrated because it’s as if she’s saying I failed to do something I’m supposed to do here, and that’s not the case at all. To date, nobody has tried to report this to the police department.”

Hayden went further and asked for answers, specifically why private investigators would be brought in to do an investigation given his police department’s decades-long history of, you know, conducting investigations. As Hayden put it, “This has all been oddly done to me as far as I’m concerned. She has to explain why she did what she did.”

Chief, when you said that, you could have been speaking for all St. Louisans — and indeed, all Missourians.

The Endgame

When prosecutions like this fall apart, they don’t go quietly. It is very possible that Kim Gardner will not only lose this trial, but that the process by which this case was handled will prove a case study in how not to prosecute someone. She could lose her bar license, and it is possible that a countersuit by the governor and his defense team would lead to millions in damages and fines. If the police or FBI or US attorney begin looking at her conduct in this case, she could even end up serving time herself.

Because of the stakes, here is how I suspect this will play out: The prosecution will get desperate. They will start grasping at anything, any shred of an attack on the governor, the better with which to support their failing case. So don’t be surprised if they begin to poison the well in the press, even more than they already have. They may make more outlandish claims about what the governor did or did not do to the alleged victim. They may even try to indict the governor on some other charge, as a way of distracting the public from the flimsiness of the first one. Already subpoenas have been issued from Gardner’s office on matters unrelated to the first indictment. Another ludicrous indictment is likely to come for a prosecutor who needs to dig her way out of the hole she made.

A story making the rounds in St. Louis police circles speaks to just how far the prosecution is willing to go now that their core case has begun to fall apart. As word has it, on Tuesday of this week, Gardner invited someone she knew from her school days over to her office. The gentleman was a cop. She told him to come to her office, a chance for old friends to catch up.

When he came into the office, he was brought in to sit with Gardner — and with the lead investigator on the Greitens case, William Tisaby. Quickly, Gardner and Tisaby began pressing the cop for details on the security procedures at the Chase Park Plaza hotel, where the woman who the governor had the affair with worked. Were there tapes available of people’s comings and goings in the hotel that they could get their hands on?

The cop was, correctly, bothered by their questions. This wasn’t why he had come to her office. He asked if he needed to bring in his department representation. Presumably he knew, as the police chief himself stated, that the police were not involved in this case. He told them nothing. Sensing that her “source” was not going to cooperate, Gardner is said to have excused herself, and the meeting ended.

That story reveals the great lengths to which the circuit attorney may be having to go to find evidence: deceiving police officers in order to get help in her investigation that appears to be falling apart. And, perhaps worst of all, she’s said to be wasting a cop’s time by involving him in a case about the personal lives of private citizens (the governor was a private citizen when all this took place). St. Louis had one of its bloodiest weekends in a long time just this past weekend. And our circuit attorney is said to be busy asking about hotel rooms at the Chase Park Plaza.

But we now have ample evidence to suggest this is just how Gardner does business. And if she sees the inside of a jail cell or watches her bank account go to zero because of her actions against the governor, then she will simply reap what she has sowed — and what many in law enforcement believe she has deserved since her earliest days as circuit attorney.

"A Crank Called Police To Shutter Kids' Lemonade Stand, And It Worked","There is nothing more American than little kids in the neighborhood running a lemonade stand. It’s not a European thing, nor is it a Chinese thing. Only in America. For generations, lemonade stands have become a staple of summer and, like apple pies, one of the best things to demonstrate the American spirit: earning your own spending money through entrepreneurship.

That’s why Jennifer Knowles, a Denver mom of three boys, thought it was a good idea to have her boys run a lemonade stand in their Stapleton, Colorado, neighborhood this past Memorial Day. She hoped to teach her boys lessons she learned when she had her own lemonade stand as a little girl — entrepreneurship, responsibility, and the value of running your own business.

Her boys decided to take it a step further: they planned to donate all proceeds from their lemonade stand to a charity organization called Compassion International. More specifically, the boys picked a little 5-year-old boy from Indonesia through Compassion International, for whom their proceeds would help provide necessities including clean water.

On Memorial Day, the weather was nice and hot. The three boys set up their lemonade stand with mom’s help. Two cups of lemonade for $1. The 6-year-old even brought his toy cash register and he got good practice in addition and subtraction. All three boys got good practice in customer service. Many people stopped by and praised the boys for doing a good job. The boys were feeling pretty good about themselves. Unfortunately, half an hour into their first business venture, police showed up.

Apparently, someone called the police to complain that the boys were running a lemonade stand without a permit. So the police showed up to shut this little illegal operation down. According to Jennifer, the boys were “crushed and devastated.” Her 4-year-old heard what the police were saying and started to cry.

Colorado doesn’t have any specific rule that either prohibits or protects a child-run lemonade stand. Yet what kind of sick person would call the cops on a hot sunny day to complain about three little kids and their lemonade stand? Why didn’t the police tell the person who complained to take a hike? Shouldn’t the valuable and limited police resources be better spent on something like catching a drunk driver? Why did the police respond and why did they feel it was the right thing to shut down a perfectly innocent lemonade stand and to scare little kids who were trying to do something good and honorable?

It turns out local wars against kids’ lemonade stands have been going on for some time. A CNBC report in 2015 documented the kind of bureaucracies that aspiring and entrepreneurial American kids are up against. On August 6, 2010, county officials of Portland, Oregon, told a 7-year-old girl that she would be fined $500 if she continued selling lemonade without first obtaining a $120 permit to do so.

On August 8, 2013, police in Queens, New York, shut down a lemonade stand run by 9-year-old Nora and 11-year old Jameala, citing that anyone who operates any food stand is required to get a permit from the Department of Health with no exceptions. On May 18, 2014, San Francisco police shut down two adolescents’ lemonade stands. One of those stand owners, an 11-year-old, was told that simply giving away the fudge brownies and lemonade the police forbade her from selling would result in a $1,500 fine.

As you can imagine, obtaining a food permit is costly. Getting one from local authorities usually costs around $120 per year. A similar permit from the Department of Health costs $388 for two years. In addition, there is a $70 application fee, a $25 endorsement fee and a $43.3 technology fee. This means those would-be young entrepreneurs will be roughly $500 in red before they even set up their little operations. Given that fact that a cup of lemonade is usually sold for $1, these children will have to sell a lot of lemonade just to break even.

Even some adults realized that they have gone too far. The State of Utah passed a law last year to legalize lemonade stands and other businesses run by kids, which means cities and counties cannot require a license or permit for any occasional business operated by a minor. It’s sad that lawmakers have to use legislative resource to address something that should be dealt with common sense. Yet kids in Utah should consider themselves lucky, because what happened to Jennifer Knowles’ boys in neighboring Colorado is the latest testament that war on lemonade stands is still on.

For more than 200 years, entrepreneurs of all skin color and backgrounds have been the engine of the U.S. economy and their grits and hard work have created America’s enormous economic success. But by 2016, the new business creation rate in the U.S. is at nearly a 40-year low. Consequently, new jobs come from new businesses that are less than a year old reached new low too. It peaked in 1999 — about 4.7 million jobs came from startups. in 2015, only 3 million came from startups,

If you wonder why we don’t have more people like Jeff Bezos and why today’s young people seem not to have the similar appreciation for hard work like previous generations did, look no further than the missing lemonade stands that have been busted by adults who seemingly lack better things to wage their power at. When bureaucracies stop American children’s ambition and use government power to turn something sweet into something sour, we as a nation are walking down a path of a self-inflicted decline.

The Last Antifa Altercation May Forecast Worse In Portland This Weekend,"On June 30, I attended a rally in Portland, Oregon, put on by a group called Patriot Prayer, at which Antifa and other militia-like groups congregated and fought. Patriot Prayer has said they will continue marches in Portland until everyone who wants to can march safely, because Antifa has threatened and carried out violent responses to others’ attempts to exercise free speech.

On August 4, people are going to come in from all over the United States for another rally, and I’m worried about what might happen given that police did not prevent violence last time. I have attended several of these marches over the last year up and down the west coast. It feels like the violence and lawlessness is increasing, especially due to lack of police action as protesters brawl.

For the June 30 rally, Patriot Prayer worked with the Department of Homeland Security and the Portland Police Bureau to get the permits needed and to plan a march that they hoped would be safe for the participants. The police, under supervision of DHS, established a no-weapons zone and searched the participants and all who entered the park. No guns, mace, bear spray, Tasers, or anything that could be used as a weapon.

All of the flag poles I looked at were hollow PVC pipe. Anyone found with a weapon or banned item at the checkpoint was arrested.

Another group, Proud Boys, came in to provide protection for the march participants. Both local and several out of state chapters attended the event. While the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled them an alt-right hate group, they contend that they are not at all alt-right and accept people regardless of race or sexual orientation.

What happened at the last rally, in my estimation, was preventable. The police made sure the people attending the rally were disarmed (not even mace) and all of those people readily agreed to the conditions knowing they would be arrested if they did not comply. It was obvious that no one surrounding the park — i.e., Antifa — would face similar searches and could be carrying an assortment of weapons.

Because of this, it was imperative that the police provide protection on the pre-planned march route, because the marchers had voluntarily disarmed. The police didn’t. A police escort flanked the marchers on the east side and used moveable barricades on the roads intersecting on the west side. Antifa and black bloc anarchists just went around to the side streets and attacked from there.

Below is the story in pictures.

This was the entrance into the park, a federal plaza. Security inside and around the park was through DHS. To get in to the park you had to submit to a search of your things and if it was found you were carrying any kind of a weapon you were subject to arrest.

Originally, the attendees were told they could bring mace in quantities of less than two ounces. Rules were changed once they got there. For anyone wondering why they would want to carry mace or pepper spray, several people have been attacked on the way out of rallies while returning to their vehicles. They were allowed to keep helmets, safety glasses, and protective gear.

Portland Police guarding the northwest corner of the Federal Plaza. Across the street is Chapman Park, where Antifa and black bloc were gathering.

There was a significant amount of police in and around the park. I saw officers from DHS, the county sheriff, and Portland Police. The park was secure and free from violence. The protestors on the other side were yelling epithets and sometimes throwing things, but you could easily avoid interaction with them by stepping away from the barrier.

People mingled and waited for the speeches and music to start. There were people from Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

I walked around the borders of the park to take a look at the outside. These three were at the entrance to the plaza with the woman doing all of the talking. She yelled at the police about their jobs (she thought police were a waste of her tax dollars) and about the racist people inside the park and how guarding them was a waste of the public’s money. Remember these three, as we encounter them a few photos down.

While walking to Chapman Park, I came across these people, who were masking up to join Antifa and black bloc there.

In Chapman Park. Protestor stands with her sign facing away from the Federal Plaza.

Antifa hanging out on the backside of Chapman Park.

Police in riot gear wait for the march to start.

Remember these three? They moved down the front of the barricades closer to Chapman Park, where most of Antifa was waiting and continuing to argue with officers who then began to ask them to leave.

This man appeared in front of me as I was walking back towards the Federal Plaza and the Patriot Prayer gathering. He wouldn’t say anything when spoken to, just held up his sign higher. I am not sure who or what he represents other than the usual Keep Portland Weird scene.

Here we are again. These three. The woman decided to engage this Proud Boy. Conversation went along the lines of race and race betrayal. Both held their own until they were asked to leave the barrier.

Shortly after I took the picture above, one of the two men outside of the barricade, who was asked to leave, refused. He was then arrested. It was one of the few arrests of the day.

Back inside Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza, the rally begins with speeches and songs.

Patriot Prayer founder and Washington state U.S. Senate candidate Joey Gibson called on everyone to bend a knee for prayer. It is the only thing, he said, that you should bend a knee for.

Gibson addresses the group before they left for their march.

Getting ready for the march, Joey pumps up the crowd with words of encouragement. A large contingent of Proud Boys were at the front and rear of the marchers to provide extra security. They would be needed.

Proud Boys traveled from several states to be a part of this rally and to provide security.

Someone started yelling out “I pledge allegiance…” and the crowd jumped in and finished with him.

Attendees started the march and were greeted on the corner with this scene. Antifa and other protestors swarmed over from the park into the street screaming things like, “Racist mother-ckers! Go home, Nazis! Lights out, alt-right!”

Antifa and other protestors swarm out into the street at the back end of the protest. They were taking pictures, using airhorns, and screaming at the marchers.

A few seconds into the march someone (the guy in the middle) threw firecrackers and Antifa and black bloc surged forward even more. It made me nervous so I started to retreat.

As I was retreating, DHS, or maybe Portland Police, started firing pellet guns for crowd control. It got very loud, very quick. According to Antifa’s social media posts several of the crowd was hit. They pulled back and the tail end of the marchers got safely past with the police following behind them.

As the Patriot Prayer contingent marched forward there were other protestors screaming “Racists!,” “Bigots!” “F-ck you!” and taking pictures of them.

These people ignored police orders to get back from Patriot Prayer.

The police start to load up onto their vehicles to follow the marchers from behind.

​This is the moment the march turned the corner and were confronted with the sight of Antifa coming up the side street. Antifa had taken down barriers and were pouring up the street in large numbers. Shortly after this some kind of explosives were thrown and detonated in the middle of the crowd here.

The moment the two sides met up.

​I talked to the Proud Boy in the helmet above and asked what was happening. He said he was pulling that person off of someone to separate them. There were dozens of brawls going on in this street at that moment. Antifa tossed at least three different homemade improvised explosive devices into the crowd in this block as well as spraying copious amounts of pepper spray. The groups eventually separated and the march resumed.

This is the next block up on the march that had been closed off by police with barricades. Antifa just went around it and came towards the march again.

The two sides meet up again: Antifa and a Proud Boy. Immediately after this, fights started on every side of me and all up and down the street. The man with the red scarf in the back is holding a weapon of some sort under his arm. Remember, anyone attending the Patriot Prayer event had been disarmed of anything that even resembled a weapon.

These are Sharps/black bloc/Antifa. The man in the denim vest (also giving the finger in the picture above) in the middle of turning away had just been punched in the face by someone from the march.

Here’s the brawl that started a moment later. I was surrounded on all sides by brawls.

​Police in riot gear clearing the streets and breaking up the fighting. Portland police held everyone there for around five minutes and then on a loudspeaker told everyone to return to the plaza. The march had been declared a riot and permits were revoked.

Streets are cleared and everyone started the walk back to the park a few blocks away. Medics started attending to the injured across the street.

I took some pictures of the injured at the park. Many people had been pepper-sprayed repeatedly by Antifa. The telltale sign is the milk of magnesia that they wear from rinsing their eyes and skin. Looking over my pictures later, I discovered a discarded can of wasp spray as well.

Pepper sprayed.

Hit in the head with an asp.

Pepper sprayed.

Pepper sprayed and hit in the forearm with a blunt object.

Pepper sprayed and hit in the head with a blunt object. At this point I ceased taking pictures and was trying to figure out my exit from the park. Antifa and black bloc were still at the exit to the park and the Department of Homeland Security was clearing the park and demanding that everyone leave.

Most people had nowhere to go, as they had taken a chartered bus in from Vancouver in an effort to prevent their tires from being slashed, which has happened in the past. While I knew I could leave the park and walk to my car, I didn’t want to be followed. Eventually police used flash bangs to disperse the crowd of protestors so people from Patriot Prayer could leave safely.

The one thing that always sticks with me when I attend these events, especially as I look at the images I took, is the hatred and anger from the people “protesting” Patriot Prayer. It is disconcerting to look at all the faces, even through the protection and emotional distance of a camera lens, screaming and spitting and throwing things. They are enraged, and use foul language. They hate you, and want to physically harm and intimidate you.

In following up I asked Portland Police about how they managed the march, why they changed the route, and did not keep the two groups separate. I also asked about the explosions I heard and felt. This was the response I got from Portland Police’s public information officer:

The Police Bureau attempts to ensure a safe environment so community members may exercise their First Amendment to free speech and assembly, as well as ensure safety for community members not participating in events. The Police Bureau assesses multiple aspects of an event and determines the best course of action after careful assessment and understanding of the capabilities of the assets available at an event. It was the Police Bureau’s desire to have the pre-planned route followed. The Police Bureau cannot limit access to public areas based on a person or group’s political ideology or past behavior. Events, like the event on June 30, 2018, are extremely complicated and difficult to ensure for the safety of all those around. There are people that arrive at events that have the intention of participating in criminal behavior. I do not know that we have located and investigated the specific types of fireworks being thrown during the event; however, I am aware that officers reported hearing items that made loud booms during the event. Sergeant Chris Burley Public Information Officer Portland Police Bureau

Kathryn Townsend of Patriot Prayer said the march had been planned with the police, who had promised to keep the two groups separate. “We were supposed to have a police escort in front, in back and on the sides. In fact, the police told David [the march organizer] to get the permit SO they could help us. They said they couldn’t protect us UNLESS we got a permit.”

She went on to say, “I trusted the safety plans so much, I even told people not to worry, [that] Antifa will be [kept] away from us. It feels now like a set up.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/03/pictures-last-antifa-altercation-may-forecast-worse-portland-weekend/,2018-08-03
Charlottesville In Panic Over Nazis Who Might Not Even Show Up,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — A year after violent brawls and a vehicular homicide marked a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the town is shutting itself down for three days. Is this because the Nazis are coming back? No, it’s because they might come back, a speculation that is spinning a fair number of people around here into a full-blown panic.

I realized this when I discovered that the gym I usually go to is shutting down for the whole weekend, because it’s sort-of kind-of not very far from the site of last year’s riots. Maybe they decided to do it because basically the entire downtown of the city is going on lockdown.

The Daily Progress reports:

The city … has banned anything that could be construed or used as a weapon, from glass bottles to camera tripods. Police will either block off or man blockades at all downtown intersections between High Street and Water Street, from McIntire Road/Fifth Street to Avon Street. Only two police-manned checkpoints will be available for pedestrians seeking access to the Downtown Mall and Market Street and Court Square parks. Police have said they will confiscate any banned items. An estimated 700 Virginia State Police personnel are expected to join more than a hundred local police and up to 300 Virginia National Guardsmen are in the area or ready to be mobilized.

Why this massive police-state crackdown?

Although white supremacist organizations have not officially scheduled any events in the area, police and activists have expressed concerns that some may show up on the anniversary.

Sure, maybe this is just an abundance of caution on the part of state and local police who utterly failed to prepare for last year’s rally and to keep the two violent sides separated. But then how do you explain stuff like this: “Throughout the day on Thursday, reports surfaced from concerned citizens who believed they saw persons resembling Nazis and white supremacists in locations from office supply stores to coffee shops.”

Who is a “person resembling a Nazi?” How do you define that? I just got a really short haircut, because it’s 95 degrees out. Would that make me “look like a Nazi?” Probably not, because I’m not a hipster, so I had my barber blend the sides. I’ll avoid coffee shops and office supply stores, just in case. But the suspicious haircut thing is a real hysteria, and people calling the cops because they saw a guy with an undercut gives you an idea of the kind of “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street” paranoia going on here.

It’s all misplaced. I know everyone has been eager to use last year’s riots to demonstrate how brave they are to oppose Nazis, seventy years after it took any real courage to do so. But what last year actually proved is that in all of North America, the most you can gather together are about 300 white nationalists. Richard Spencer couldn’t get audiences to show up for his college speaking tour. His only talent is a flair for the theatrical, and he knew what kind of photo would end up on the cover of every newspaper in the country. But all he managed to do was to manipulate the press into amplifying a tiny movement that is probably best allowed to fester in obscurity.

Maybe some Nazis will show up again this weekend. But if there are any clashes, they are more likely to be between this massive police presence and leftist counter-protesters with nothing to counter-protest, than to involve Nazis.

‘Last year, I was terrified of violence from the Nazis, and this year I am terrified of violence from the police,’ said Lisa Woolfork, associate professor of English at the University of Virginia and an organizer with Black Lives Matter Charlottesville. … ‘This state of emergency is an over-compensation for the failures of the state last year,’ said the Rev. Brittany Caine-Conley, an organizer with Congregate Cville. ‘We know, statistically, historically and anecdotally, that state repression and violence overwhelmingly affect marginalized communities. This militarized landscape will only do more harm to those who have been most significantly wounded in the past year.’

So I guess the message is: clamp down on the Nazis, just don’t use the police to do it. Liberal activists are also upset at the quartering of troops in university housing, which would probably set off the Third Amendment lobby, if not for the fact that the dorms were already empty for the summer.

It would be a supreme irony if the only news out of Charlottesville this weekend turns out to be scuffling between two groups—the police and Black Lives Matter or Antifa—who are both there to guard against the empty specter of neo-Nazis.

It’s already clear that we’ve worked ourselves into such a frenzy of paranoia that the Nazis don’t even need to show up to disrupt the whole town. This is a reflection of the bigger picture, in which we have let a few hundred creeps exploit our bitter political divisions to disrupt the entire country.

"This Year, There Was Finally Only One Side Left In Charlottesville","So the mainstream pundits are finally right. They said there was only one side behind the violence in Charlottesville last year, despite extensive reports of black-clad, far-left “Antifa” eagerly brawling with the white nationalists. This has since been cemented as an article of dogma among mainstream “liberals,” who seem determined to run interference for Antifa, even though Antifa is likely to go after them first.

But this year it looks like it’s really true. There is only one side in Charlottesville. As The New York Times summed it up, “With no sign of white supremacists there, tensions were confined to interactions between the left-leaning protesters and law enforcement.” Or, as I speculated on Friday, “It would be a supreme irony if the only news out of Charlottesville this weekend turns out to be scuffling between two groups — the police and Black Lives Matter or Antifa — who are both there to guard against the empty specter of neo-Nazis.”

So far, it looks like no more than scuffling. With no Nazis to serve as an excuse — even at their event in DC, where they managed to get a permit and a lot of police protection, it looks like no more than a handful of white nationalists showed up — the far left in Charlottesville faced only the hard target of police in riot gear, so they mostly contented themselves with slinging hateful words.

Whom do they hate? Well, mostly they’ve been “screaming at police.” The Washington Post puts this in a way intended to excuse the protesters, describing it as “confusion over an extraordinary police presence” that “turned into anger,” but that doesn’t fly when you look at the protesters’ actual message, in which they “chanted slogans … against the police, against white supremacy, and against the University of Virginia. ‘Last year they came with torches,’ said a large banner in front of a monument of Thomas Jefferson. ‘This year they come with badges.'”

You can see that banner in a photo in the article, and it’s clear that this was not just thrown together as a spontaneous reaction to the police. It was the planned message of this year’s protests. “Dozens of Antifa members, who had come from chapters all over the country … held signs that condemned the university and the police, along with white supremacists.”

Actually, it would be more accurate to say that they denounced the university and the police as white supremacists, with one protest group insisting that the police are inherently racist because “the institution of policing was created from the system of slave patrols.” It appears that the history taught to today’s kids no longer includes Sir Robert Peel.

In addition to hating higher education and law enforcement, the far left also hates the free press. I hear that it’s a really bad thing when Donald Trump denounces the media, but he can take solace that he is joined in this contempt by Antifa, which spent its protests hurling obscenities at reporters, calling them “vultures” and “snitches,” and assaulting a camera crew for the local NBC affiliate.

Having the radical left as the only side at this year’s demonstrations clarifies a few things. It shows that this was never really about statues of Confederate generals. Those statues are still up, and the “statue burqas” covering them were removed months ago without fanfare and without the city exploding into conflict.

It wasn’t about the Nazis, either. “Antifa” and the far left don’t need the specter of white nationalists to condemn anyone and everything as racist. As one chant at Saturday’s Charlottesville protests put it, “Old Jim Crow, new Jim Crow, this racist system’s got to go.” They aren’t against Nazis. They’re against the entire American system of government, which they will tell you if you bother to listen.

The far left is not “anti-fascist” but pro-Communist, which makes them just another enemy of free speech, liberty, and the rule of law. That’s the broader sense in which there is only one side we need to worry about: the enemies of freedom, of which the far left and the fascists are just two sub-factions.

"Americans Should Learn, Fast, From Europe's Lawless Streets & Prisons","A curious little piece of news came out in the French press, which was picked up by a few sources but largely ignored: Amsterdam’s top police officer has warned the city in the Netherlands is incapable of dealing with rising lawlessness.

Amsterdam is one of the most liberal cities in the West, with open and free drug laws and red-light districts. That has resulted in the city becoming a den of chaos. Tourists come from all over Europe to take advantage of lax drug and prostitution laws. Many don’t respect local police, nor care about local customs, hygiene, or safety.

European police, including those in Amsterdam, are so neutered they are not allowed to carry weapons or use force. This results in miscreants freely defecating or urinating in public, even on police cars. European police are also gender-neutral, which has resulted in comical footage of three or four officers trying to capture one strong male suspect.

Other footage of miscreants overpowering female police officers is less comical and more horrifying. In Paris recently, a female cop was sent by her superiors to tackle an African migrant gang. Again, the result was exactly what one might expect (violence warning).

Violent crimes have increased. There are turf wars between drug gangs. Illegal taxis thrive, and street races are plenty. In the words of the officer, “the city centre becomes an urban jungle at night.” The officer added that the police are powerless to do anything.

Similarly, in a setback for libertarianism, England’s first privately run prison had to be taken over by the government after it emerged that there was total anarchy within. “‘Fearful’ staff have taken to locking themselves in their own offices after being targeted by inmates,” The Telegraph reported.

It appears prisons are better managed and manned by hardcore ex-armed forces with batons and tasers than with 50-year-old grandmas asking inmates to read Deepak Chopra for holistic development. In Sweden, in one night, gangs of “youths” torched 80 cars in social-media-coordinated, military-style attacks in several cities, leading to a hapless Swedish prime minister pleading on the radio for the violence to stop and asking, “What the h-ll are you guys thinking?”

No one asked him what Sweden was thinking when it accepted millions of military-age men from different cultures, while simultaneously turning its own forces effete and gender-neutral. Western societies in general and western conservatism in particular are undergoing a crisis of masculinity. For decades, the binding principle in the West had been tilted in favor of liberty, for good reason. Conservatives and libertarians came to a tacit compromise to face off the menace of totalitarian communism. That reality has changed, and the balance is lost.

As liberals merge with former communists to shift ever further left towards democratic socialism, the conservatives have lost touch with one of the cornerstones of conservatism: central authority and order against anarchy. Given that scenario of generic lawlessness, not just in the Netherlands but in Sweden, and the United Kingdom, it is understandable that Jordan Peterson’s book emphasizing personal responsibility and good boundaries is a best-seller.

Of course, one cannot spend a day without reading about the abuse of authority in totalitarian countries, such as in Chinese and Filipino anti-drug campaigns, or the Chinese crack-down on Islamic terrorism and Uighurs as a population. There’s an entire cottage industry in western media devoted to coverage of police over-stepping boundaries in non-Western countries.

Unfortunately, less importance is given to a massive backlash in the West against a liberal push for too much liberty, without authority or responsibility. The Western elite has largely doubled down on concepts of justice based on rehabilitation, and not punitive deterrence.

In the United States, for example, liberals are determined to abolish the authority of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and even prisons, which leads to electoral defeats. In the UK and Europe, the push against authority is even worse and has resulted in a complete neutering of police. Their uniform color has changed from what might inspire confidence or fear towards more comical fluorescent colors and gender-neutral uniforms, like baseball caps instead of helmets.

Naturally, in the complete absence of law and order, there’s anarchy in certain sections of society. As Hobbes once said, authoritarians rise in anarchy, which is evident in the rise of the far right and even some far-left parties, on the platform of law and order. Second, even within Europe, cultural difference is noticeable. In some conservative U.S. states, there’s a massive push by libertarians to legalize drugs and open borders. The old-fashioned concepts of nation states and guarded borders and stern men in uniform guarding law and order and meting out justice are anathema to this utopian view of society.

Unfortunately, conservatives face this Machiavelli’s paradox. In Machiavelli’s terms, rule by love has its limits, and too much liberty leads to chaos, which might turn citizens to the arms of a strong man who will bring back order. Hobbes echoes this idea, that sometimes the fear of righteous justice is needed in society, or else people prefer the Leviathan.

Common, civilized people like order and authority. It’s a natural inclination of humans to be governed, as David Hume wrote, to be in a system where they feel safe, and where the law is supreme. People typically prefer anyone and any system which provides them with safety.

The recent appeal in Europe for authoritarian political parties strict on law and order show how much the needle has shifted, as people realize that boundless liberty as a concept, without any responsible checks and balances, or punitive authority, is incoherent and more often than not, dangerous. It should be a lesson for American conservatives not to fall in that circle.

"If Police Put American Lives Ahead Of Theirs, They'd Hurt Fewer People","An 87-year-old woman was tased by a Georgia police officer earlier this month. Her story speaks to the need for cops to be brave and willfully self sacrificial in their work, not put their own safety and rights above that of the public.

Martha al-Bashara, a Syrian-born grandmother who speaks little English, was gathering dandelions for cooking in Chatsworth, Georgia. She had a plastic bag and what was described in the police report as a steak knife and by her family as a kitchen knife. Al-Bashara crossed into an empty lot near her home and began selecting the dandelions.

Someone who worked for the Boys and Girls Club that owned the property spotted her, and called 911. The caller told operators the woman was elderly, seemed to be picking something, and didn’t seem particularly threatening, but carried a knife.

When three cops arrived, a confused confrontation ensued. Al-Bashara, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen familiar to her neighbors, refused to drop the knife, and reportedly continued to approach Police Chief Josh Etheridge and two of his officers as they told her to stop and tried to get her to drop her knife. One of the officers eventually responded by firing his Taser at the woman’s chest.

This was a risky move, since people much younger than this woman have died as a result of being tased in the chest, which Taser advises against. While Tasers are a more humane alternative to guns, good evidence suggests they’re more dangerous than police departments and the maker of Tasers have claimed.

In this case, the 5’2″ 87-year-old lady seems to be physically fine, but her family says she was upset after spending several hours in jail then at the hospital, for fear she had caused her family trouble. Etheridge stood by the police’s decision to tase the woman, declaring that risking her life was the “least force necessary.”

He also claimed that if al-Bashara had forced the officer to back away, he might have tripped. “She could have been hurt just as easily, or even fell on the knife itself,” he said, or “held the knife in an aggressive manner, and then deadly force would have been used.”

The chief’s comments and the actions of his officer are completely wrong. U.S. police officers are a class of people with special rights. They bravely go where most of us fear to tread. They have done heroic things and saved countless lives. On the other hand, their job is also to enforce the law, no matter how dreadful. That ties them to prohibitionist insanities against drugs and prostitution. Increasingly, they enforce regulatory issues, sometimes clad in militaristic SWAT gear.

Yet cops appear to believe their lives are more important than ours. Police want respect and esteem — and obedience — but they, their fraternal organizations, their unions, their chiefs, their friends and family, and everyone waving a Blue Lives Matter flag, lean on cliches such as “split-second decision” to defend unwarranted force, and stress that officer safety is paramount.

It shouldn’t be. If police have extended legal rights (which they do), and are alway armed (which they are in the United States), then they need to be braver than the rest of us, and they need to prioritize the safety of everyone else before themselves. If they are unable or unwilling to do that, they should find a different career.

Yes, knives can be dangerous. A suspect (or an elderly lady?) can close a distance faster than most people realize. But if your sympathies are still squarely on the Chatsworth cops, and not on the deaf, homeless woodcutter in Seattle, a clearly suicidal man in Missouri, or the family of a mentally distraught man in Pennsylvania, who thought they were getting him an ambulance, but instead called the police that killed him, consider how British police responded to a different incident.

This 2011 confrontation between what was eventually dozens of police and one machete-wielding unhinged man is my go-to example of clever, restrained police. Watch the way the cops duck and weave, and use the nearby trash bins to protect themselves and to unbalance the man. They’re very clearly risking life or at least limb to bring someone dangerous in alive. While Googling the incident, I found a more recent example that sounds very similar, but this time only two cops safely subdued the man.

In the United States, neither of these machete-waving individuals would have lasted a minute, because the police on the scene would have been armed with guns, and therefore been able to use lethal force. Taking that option off the table forces police to be brave and to be smart. It also forces them to do something that police in America seem unable to do — from the killings of the homeless Kelly Thomas to the 12-year-old Tamir Rice — which is deescalate and in some cases retreat. Taking guns off the table would also force them to actually risk their lives for the people they swore to serve and protect.

We have more than 300 million guns in America. That means police have to worry about being shot more than they do in places like the UK. But it also means that gun-owners could do what police do. And they could do it just as badly and as selfishly as the worst cops. Or, we could consider hiring and training a class of people who are ready to risk their safety for the safety of the potentially dangerous, the mentally ill, or the old ladies picking dandelions.

If police can’t handle that, there are options. We might consider letting them earn the right to carry a gun, or to keep them locked in their cars. But more important than the weapons they use or don’t use is the mindset that they are at war with us, and that their lives matter more. Police are not supposed to make sure they get home at any cost, they’re supposed to make sure that we do.

Al-Bashara has a court date set for Sept. 19. Her family is considering suing, as the Chatsworth Police Department swears to self-investigate super hard. Al-Bashara’s great nephew Solomon Douhne summed it up well: “You don’t Tase an 87-year-old woman. … If three police officers couldn’t handle an 87-year-old woman, you might want to reconsider hanging up your badge.” Douhne is a former police officer.

U.K. Police Urge Citizens To Report Neighbors For 'Offensive' Speech,"English police are now calling on citizens to report hate incidents. Reporting friends and neighbors to the police has terrible historical connotation, and for good reason. It is legitimate fascism. Timid citizenries are easy to control — fear that even a coworker could file a report to the police can keep people in check.

The latest call for action in England is from the South Yorkshire Police on Twitter. Similar reporting requests are posted on the United Kingdom government website. Two tweets from the South Yorkshire Police over the weekend requesting citizens to report hate matters to police should grab our attention.

The first calls out any hate “incident or crime.” There is a meaningful distinction there. The tweet defines hate incidents as “motivated by prejudice or hostility (or perceived to be so)…” The tweet ends with, “Report it and put a stop to it.”

Hate can be any incident or crime, motivated by prejudice or hostility (or perceived to be so) against a person’s race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability. Hate hurts and nobody should have to tolerate it. Report it and put a stop to it #HateHurts pic.twitter.com/xoMH8KhE9n — South Yorkshire Police (@syptweet) September 9, 2018

To be clear, reportable incidents under this scheme have as low a bar as non-crime incidents merely perceived to be hostile. This would be hilarious if it was not so serious. Law enforcement is now soliciting people to turn others in for being offensive. Freedom from criminal investigation and arrest may now be subject to someone else’s feelings or perceptions in England.

The second tweet explicitly calls on citizens to “please report non-crime hate incidents, which can include things like offensive or insulting comments, online, in person, or in writing.” Reporting non-crimes to the police already seems like a waste of time and resources, but reporting people to the police for being offensive crosses the line into fascist territory.

In addition to reporting hate crime, please report non-crime hate incidents, which can include things like offensive or insulting comments, online, in person or in writing. Hate will not be tolerated in South Yorkshire. Report it and put a stop to it #HateHurtsSY pic.twitter.com/p2xf6OLoQZ — South Yorkshire Police (@syptweet) September 9, 2018

Of course, hate crimes and legitimate hate incidents are wrong, and the perpetrators should face justice. But there can be no freedom when perceived victims’ subjective feelings can bring down the power of the state on citizens. Jokes, comments taken out of context, or simple misunderstandings can easily be conflated with legitimate hate.

The overbroad definition of hate incidents virtually guarantees that people will report frivolous complaints, which could drown real problems. It could also lead to government invasion of privacy for regular law-abiding citizens.

There is also no sense of proportionality here. A dumb comment online is subject to arrest by force because someone’s feelings are hurt? The over-broad definition also means there is likely no consequence for bad faith and frivolous reports. No limiting principle exists to discourage false or careless reports, further damaging the reputation of innocent people and wasting law enforcement time and resources.

England is once again validating the American Revolution. This grotesque power dynamic and attack on personal freedom should be condemned and rejected. Calling on citizens to report one another is unnecessary. Certainly a free people should be able to report crimes to the police, but police encouraging such a low bar for reporting will gin up controversy, suppress free speech and expression, and damage trust between the people.

When people say they want to make America like the rest of the world, keep this in mind. America stands alone in the preservation of individual liberty. Hate speech laws that give false empowerment to illegitimate, self-declared victims have no place in America. England has not only embraced this, but advanced it, and now calls on its citizens to act on it.

Rahm Emanuel’s Decline Mirrors The Democratic Party’s Identity Crisis,"The Weekly Standard’s political requiem for Rahm Emanuel captures much of the conventional wisdom about his decision to not seek reelection, primarily in his failures on crime, race relations, and the budget. The critiques are largely true, as far as they go. A closer look, however, reveals broader implications for our national politics.

At the outset, the issues driving Emanuel from office are not mutually exclusive. For example, on the crime issue, Emanuel has belatedly committed to hiring 1,000 more police. But this step has a definite budgetary impact, both in the short term and in terms of pension and health benefits decades into the future. It also will empower the city’s already influential police union at a time policing reform is greatly needed.

Any increase in the number of police and the aggressiveness of policing will likely be directed toward the neighborhoods with the most serious crime problems, which are often minority neighborhoods. Given the historical relationship of the Chicago Police Department with minority neighborhoods, making progress on both crime and race relations is easier said than done. Moreover, this borrowed money is now being spent on policing after Emanuel closed schools and clinics in many of these neighborhoods, exacerbating the city’s often racial politics.

Chicago’s problems are like a Rubik’s Cube, but far more difficult to solve. In addition, while Emanuel failed in a number of ways attributable to his administration, his fate was also affected by the ghosts of the past and the future.

The Weekly Standard correctly notes the spike in murders on Emanuel’s watch, which is a great tragedy. On the other hand, the city’s murder rate per capita is below that of St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, Cleveland, Kansas City, Memphis, and Newark. People tend not to think of St. Louis or Memphis as deadlier cities, because people associate Chicago as much with Al Capone or the 1968 riots as they do with Michael Jordan.

Chicago’s surge in homicides, as in other cities, is subsiding, but not quickly enough to help Emanuel. Moreover, while the murder rate is tragic, the truly scandalous aspect of the tragedy may be the Chicago Police Department’s manipulation of the reporting of murders and other crimes to make them seem less serious.

Underscoring the linkage of the city’s problems, the spike in gun violence may have been due to a decline in law enforcement activity after the release of the video showing the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Chicago paid nearly $642 million for alleged police misconduct from 2004-2015, a period that extends well back into the tenure of former Mayor Richard M. Daley. These sums continue to balloon because they are financed with debt.

The government’s attempt to suppress the McDonald video until after Emanuel’s reelection may be blamed on Rahm. It also represents the final straw for those frustrated with Chicago’s long, poor record on race relations. In 1966, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. told reporters, “I have never seen, even in Mississippi and Alabama, mobs as hateful as I’ve seen here in Chicago.” In 1983, when Harold Washington became Chicago’s first black mayor, the opposition from a mostly white bloc of aldermen in the city council became the stuff of legend and stand-up comedy.

Although conditions have improved, enough de facto segregation remains that racial tensions are never far from the surface. The Weekly Standard correctly notes Emanuel hurt himself by closing schools and mental health clinics in low-income and black communities. His budgetary justification for the school closings has been challenged from the left and right. But while The Weekly Standard focused on the exodus of blacks from the city, the emigration transcends race as Chicagoans flee their government’s fiscal irresponsibility.

Also, regarding the school closings, left and right generally agree in condemning the diversion of tax-increment financing (TIF) — a scheme originally authorized to aid blighted areas — to enrich the city’s traditional political establishment. Daley exploited this slush fund to benefit the cronies who funded his campaigns; Emanuel failed to consider that new thinking may have been required to help solve the Cube. However, such new thinking would have annoyed the oligarchic establishment effectively running the city for decades.

Here, Emanuel’s fall offers a lesson about national politics. When Emanuel entered City Hall, he intended to govern as a neoliberal. He proposed education reforms along the lines championed by the center-left, including charter school expansion, closing underused and underperforming public schools, and longer school days. He hoped to help rationalize the city’s finances by privatizing some city assets and services.

Emanuel’s plans did not survive contact with his opponents. His education agenda angered not only minority communities, but also the powerful teacher’s union. (Much of the revival in teacher union activism nationwide was inspired by CTU victories over Emanuel.) He was only partly successful in fixing some of Daley’s cozy privatization deals. His dual transit and debit card system looked as business-friendly as some of Daley’s deals.

In a one-party city, Emanuel was forced to move left. He capped the number of new charter schools, cut back on TIF giveaways, backed a minimum wage hike, and dropped pension reform. The last was in part due to the teachers, but also in large part to secure a reelection endorsement from the firefighters’ union. Public-sector unionism looms large for both Emanuel and Chicago.

That leftward shift allowed Emanuel to squeak to reelection over Jesus “Chuy” Garcia in a 2015 runoff. Garcia, who will likely succeed Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez in the House next year, represents the mix of “democratic socialism” and identity politics on the rise in the Democrats’ urban strongholds. But Emanuel’s victory was Pyrrhic, burning enough political capital to make another term unlikely.

Emanuel’s fall illustrates the transformation of the Democratic Party in the Obama era. The party shrunk considerably, to a core of holdover urban machine politicians being overtaken by an activist base of identitarians and the far left.

We may not have Rahm Emanuel to kick around anymore. But if he makes a Nixonesque rise from the ashes, the role he would play in Democratic politics will likely find him acquiescent to what his party is becoming.

"Rift Between Police, Feds Allowed NM Terror Compound To Fester","Questions keep coming about how the U.S. justice system responded to a New Mexico compound that housed five alleged would-be jihadists and 11 reportedly malnourished children along with the remains of a twelfth child who died on the compound.

A federal grand jury recently indicted the five alleged jihadists on weapons and conspiracy charges, alleging the group created their compound in the desert outside Taos, New Mexico as a training camp and firing range to facilitate a “Common plan to prepare for violent attacks government, military, educational and financial institutions” and sought to “engage in jihad and form an army of jihad” according to the federal indictment published by the Department of Justice on September 11.

The five suspects—Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, Lucas Morten, Subhanah Wahhaj, Hujrah Wahhaj, and Jany Leveille—had previously faced state charges of child abuse, but the charges floundered in court after a New Mexico judge dismissed charges against all five suspects when state prosecutors missed a 10-day deadline for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors argued extenuating circumstances but were rebuffed.

The federal charges echo information first laid out in the state prosecutors’ motion urging the judge in the case to reconsider the judge’s dismissal of bail, given evidence that the suspects had discussed targeted attacks against “corrupt institutions,” including schools and an Atlanta-area hospital. Suspects reportedly had repeatedly discussed a willingness to fight and kill law enforcement, and to die as “martyrs.” Prosecutors cited testimony from children inside the camp saying they were being trained to conduct school shootings or other attacks.

The five suspects were arrested after local police launched a raid to respond to reports of child abuse from inside the camp, only to discover a shooting range, multiple weapons, and documents describing a potential terrorist attack, including a document titled “Phases of a Terrorist Attack.”

Neighbors Were Telling Police Disturbing Information

The federal charges highlight what appears to have been a disconnect between state and federal law enforcement over how to address the New Mexico compound and its armed residents. The compound was under surveillance from both local and federal law enforcement, but it took several months for law enforcement to intervene despite reports from the local community.

Sirraj Ibn Wahhaj faced a Georgia-issued child abduction warrant, and neighbors reportedly identified the missing child, Abdul Ghani, who was known to possess a limp. A child with a limp was also reportedly detected by FBI aerial surveillance.

Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe has told media that local authorities didn’t intervene over concerns they lacked probable cause to act. But CNN reported that a local officer told neighbors law enforcement’s “hands were tied” by the FBI.

“‘We’ve gotten multiple calls on this child but, at the same time, our hands are tied because the FBI has whatever they got going on up there with them,’” CNN quoted the officer as saying, according to a recording the news channel acquired.

This would not be the first case in which a disconnect between federal and local officials led to potential danger for a local community. In Garland, Texas, a free speech protest and cartoon contest on May 3, 2015 was targeted by two Islamic State-linked jihadists armed with rifles, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The attack took place while an undercover FBI agent shadowed the two attackers and took pictures.

While the FBI says they warned Garland police that the two may have had an interest in the target, police guarding the event say they were never warned of an impending assault. Simpson and Soofi injured a security guard before being shot dead by a quick-acting Garland police officer.

Failing to Intercept ‘Known Wolves’

Repeated incidents of western law enforcement agencies having detailed intelligence on terror suspects, yet failing to prevent attacks has led to the use of the term “Known Wolves” by policy critics, who say agencies aren’t doing enough to preempt terrorism by those under surveillance.

Feelings of mutual distrust between local and federal law enforcement linger, despite the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) system intended to incorporate local and state law enforcement with the FBI’s efforts. While local law enforcement complains of having hands tied or being left uninformed of dangerous jihadists in their midst, federal law enforcement sometimes sees local law enforcement as compromised.

Examples include Fairfax County Police officer Weiss Rasool, who in 2005 allegedly searched police databases and tipped off terror suspects, who were preparing to flee when federal law enforcement swooped in to make an arrest. And in 2009 FBI agents fumed when a local imam tipped off Najibullah Zazi, the leader of a three-person terror cell plotting bombings in New York City. The imam had been contacted by New York Police Department officers looking for intel.

While federal authority over terrorism cases predominates, the New Mexico case feeds local law enforcement’s growing perception that they can’t assume the FBI has the situation under control. It also indicates the difficulties for local law enforcement when complicated cases with possible terror links are suddenly thrust into their laps.

It’s local law enforcement, not federal agents, who remain most likely to receive community tips, and to recognize changes in their neighborhood beats. Local law enforcement is also more likely to be the first to spot tell-tale signs of criminal schemes to finance terrorism, or crimes like child or domestic abuse that may open a window of intervention, as occurred in the New Mexico case.

While investigators’ handling of the child abuse case in New Mexico raises concerns, the use of state-level terrorism prosecutions has seen significant success in states like neighboring Arizona, where counterterrorism laws do not require an “overt act” to prosecute, as federal terrorism laws do, making preemptive prosecutions of would-be jihadists more viable.

We should continue to expect better cooperation between all levels of law enforcement in the effort to defeat jihadist terror. But at the end of the day, local law enforcement should not accept having their “hands tied” from protecting their communities nor take a back seat on counterterrorism.

‘Making A Murderer’s’ Steven Avery Is Still Guilty As Hell,"If you haven’t watched the first season of “Making a Murderer,” none of this will make any sense to you. If you haven’t watched the second season of “Making a Murderer,” consider yourself lucky. Everything below is a spoiler.

I should start by noting that the popular first season of “Making a Murder” was a transparent work of advocacy journalism. It set out to prove the innocence of Steven Avery, who spent 18 years in prison for another crime before exonerated by DNA evidence, then later convicted of the gruesome murder of Teresa Halbach. It failed. Although the second season is comparably unconvincing, its biggest drawback isn’t that it breaks little new ground but that, unlike the first season, it’s also insufferably boring.

In the first episode of Season 2, Kathleen Zellner, Avery’s new noted Chicago post-conviction lawyer, says the state’s entire case will collapse. Zellner promised that the murder conviction would be vacated, and that she would take great personal pleasure in unmasking prosecutorial abuse and planted evidence. None of this happened.

Zellner, who had exonerated 19 men in the past, is no joke. Then again, she took the Avery case only after it became a national story. Before then, she ignored the family’s pleas for four years. She probably did so for very good reasons. While Zellner spends a bunch of time highlighting deficiencies in law enforcement procedures and professionalism—many of them concerning and genuine—she does nothing to prove Avery’s innocence.

A person can get bogged down in every theory Zellner unfurls during Season 2 and forget how farfetched the overall defense of Avery really is. Rather than reviewing all the minutiae of Zellner’s claims—many of her boldest ones don’t even rely on evidence, but you can judge for yourself— it’s worth remembering all the conspiracies we have to accept to believe Avery to be set up for the murder. None of them have really changed from the first season.

Let’s Go Through Those Conspiracies

First off, viewers still have to accept that Halbach’s body was moved onto Avery’s property by members of the Manitowoc, Wisconsin police department, or someone else hoping to frame him, then burned in a firepit in front of his home—with other murder tools belonging to Avery—without anyone on the busy property noticing.

Zellner adds another layer to this aspect of the story by claiming that the body was burned somewhere else and then moved to the fire pit. So the Manitowoc police, or the real killer, murdered an innocent women (one Avery happened to be obsessed with), stole his tools before the murder took place, and moved everything to the fire pit before the police showed up. Okay.

But the viewer is also asked to believe that police (or some steely nerved mastermind killer who, as far as we know, has never struck before or after) snuck into the Avery home, and not only planted the keys to Halbach’s car in his trailer but also planted Avery’s non-blood DNA onto those keys (as Zellner claims). All of this had to be premeditated, as well, since it had to have happened before the police searched Avery’s trailer and before they had a chance to plant any DNA evidence on the key.

Zellner disputes that DNA evidence on the key. She says it was planted. She says someone also planted Avery’s non-blood DNA evidence on the inside latch of the trunk of Halbach’s car (and blood in half a dozen places elsewhere in the car) after dumping the car on the property without anyone noticing. All of it before the police showed up.

That exhibits tremendous forethought. But the viewer still has to believe, on top of all of this, that the police devised a way to plant more DNA evidence onto the ammunition casings found in the Avery garage, which was not only linked to Halbach but forensically tied to Avery’s gun. This means that that cops, or another murderer, got their hands on a rifle that hung over Avery’s bed, fired it without any of the family’s knowledge, shot a woman in the garage without anyone’s knowledge (or maybe they transported Avery’s gun somewhere else and shot her), then also planted the forensic evidence without anyone’s knowledge. All before the police showed up.

Quite a feat. Turns out, the Manitowoc police are either incompetent or criminal geniuses. What’s more, not a single one of the people involved in all of these intrigues has ever slipped up once after all these years.

That’s Not Even Half of It

Viewers of “Making a Murderer” must also ignore that Avery not only called Auto Trader and specifically requested Halbach, who was a photographer with the company, to take pictures of his car the day she was murdered, but that he did so using a false name to trick her to show up. She had been there once before, and Avery had scared her. Avery called Halbach’s personal cell phone three times the day she was murdered, twice using *67 to obscure his identity, and only once using his own number — after she was already dead, in a transparent alibi attempt. (All of this was conveniently unmentioned in Season 1.)

Avery, who initially claimed that Halbach had never shown up—a weird thing to lie about for an innocent person—was the last known person to see her alive. An Avery family member, Bobby Dassey—more on him in a second— testified that he witnessed Halbach arrive on Avery’s property to take pictures of the car, and that he watched Halbach “walking over” to Avery’s trailer.

Why would Dassey lie? Well, Zellner wants us to believe that it was Dassey who murdered Halbach. You can believe that cops might be lazy and focused on the wrong man, or that prosecutors railroaded that man because they were harboring a grudge, but how would the police know to plant DNA evidence on the car, the casing from the rifle, and Halbach’s keys to help Dassey? Unless, of course, you believe Dassey could get his hands on Avery’s blood and non-blood DNA and plant it himself without leaving a single fingerprint or bit of DNA, or any other evidence, behind.

Steven Avery Has a Violent, Twisted History

The Bobby Dassey theory revolves around a Zellner accusation that he had erased files from a computer that contained “images of Ms. Halbach, violent pornography and dead bodies of young females viewed by Bobby at relevant time periods before and after the murder of Ms. Halbach.” We have no idea if this is true. But if this speculation is, in fact, important, it’s also worth mentioning that Avery isn’t the sweet and innocent man the show portrays, but a person with a long and disturbing history of violence, including an episode where he doused a cat in gasoline and watched it be burned alive for entertainment. Season 1 described this incident as a youthful indiscretion, leaving out the specifics.

Then there is Avery’s history of fetishizing sexual violence. Avery told an inmate during his first stint in prison that he was looking forward to constructing a “torture chamber,” one he had drawn up plans for, so he could rape, torment, and murder women. Of course, these last two things don’t make Avery guilty, but they are just as pertinent as most of the other things the documentarians do focus on.

Then there is the confession of Brendan Dassey, also convicted in Halbach’s murder, who is Avery’s nephew and Bobby’s half-brother. Zellner claims early in Season 2 that detectives “planted” the murder story in “[Brendan] Dassey’s brain.”

There are problems with Dassey’s confession, which many people rightly claim was coerced (even criminals have constitutional rights that should be taken seriously). It is also true that many people give false confessions for a number of seemingly inexplicable reasons.

Yet, if you’re really into the case you can read entire transcript of the questioning (1 and 2). There was plenty of bullying. Nothing, however, was planted. Dassey’s detailed narrative (from a teen who supposedly never left his room) matched the forensic evidence. Dassey knew exactly where the gun was used without anyone telling him. Dassey knew exactly where Halbach was killed. No one planted that in his head.

So you would need to believe all of these incidents, confessions, DNA, cars, and casing were part of wideranging set-ups to also believe Avery is innocent. The gun alone would have probably been enough to convict him. The body alone probably would have been enough to convict him. The car and blood would have been enough to convict him. The Dassey confession would be enough to convict him. The calls, in conjunction with the witness seeing Halbach heading towards the trailer, might have been enough to convict him. Murders are often convicted without any physical evidence at all, for that matter.

No court has ever bought any of the conspiracy theories about alternative murderers. There has been one appeal after the next. Are all these courts in on the conspiracy, as well? Now, maybe one day exculpatory evidence that the public isn’t privy to will emerge. There are, after all, many innocent people in jail (although it’s difficult not to notice that Avery’s lawyers want you to ignore the same kind of DNA evidence that once exonerated him). As it stands, though, Steven Avery isn’t one of them, no matter how many seasons of “Making A Murderer” they squeeze out.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/11/making-a-murderers-steven-avery-is-still-guilty-as-hell/,2018-12-11
What Makes ‘Die Hard’ A Christmas Movie,"The 1988 action classic “Die Hard,“ starring Bruce Willis and the late Alan Rickman, has become standard holiday season viewing in the 30 years since its release, but the debate remains: Is it really a “Christmas movie,” or just a movie that happens to be set at Christmas?

Of course, that question ultimately doesn’t matter much. It’s only a matter of genre, which has really no bearing on either our enjoyment or understanding of a film. That said, as far as there can be an objective qualification for “Christmas movie,” I’d say “Die Hard” meets the requirements.

What Counts As a Christmas Movie?

Since the question hinges on there being a difference between a Christmas movie proper and a movie set around Christmas, it seems that a Christmas movie proper is a film that has some thematic element of Christmas as a central part of its story, while also linking this theme with the Christmas holiday itself. For instance, generosity and kindness are Christmas themes, but a film is not a Christmas movie for featuring them, only if they are linked with the Christmas season (otherwise something like “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town” would be considered a Christmas movie).

So a Christmas movie is a movie specifically about Christmas and the related ideas of love, generosity, family, and so on. “Miracle on 34th Street” is a Christmas movie, not only because it is set during Christmas and features Santa Claus, but because it is all about putting innocence, generosity, and kindness ahead of modern cynicism and consumerism.

It would be going too far to say that “Die Hard” has the same moral premise as “Miracle on 34th Street,” but it wouldn’t be wholly inaccurate either, because “Die Hard” is all about the clash between love and materialism.

The Allure of Greed

The film, as most of us well know, follows New York cop John McClane as he flies out to Los Angeles to visit his family for Christmas. He is separated from his wife, Holly, who moved to LA to take a lucrative job with the Nakatomi Corporation. Soon after he meets her at the company Christmas party, the building is taken over by terrorists led by the intimidating Hans Gruber, who are looking to rob the high-tech vault of half a billion dollars.

One of the perennial temptations of the Christmas season is losing sight of the actual meaning of the holiday and becoming too preoccupied by the materialistic desire for gain (Black Friday gives us yearly examples of this sort of thing in action). The celebration of Christmas, and even visits with family and friends, turn into rote, mechanical exchanges, in which we simply go through the motions, without considering any deeper purpose to the holiday. “Die Hard,” in its own way, is all about this phenomenon, about losing sight of what is truly important amid the commercial, the material, and the automated.

This theme is established from the start of the film. John and Holly McClane’s marriage is on shaky grounds because neither is willing to compromise on their careers for the sake of their family. Holly moved across country and even adopted her maiden name (“Gennaro,” evoking “generic”) to pursue her corporate job, while John accepted the separation to continue his job as a cop in New York. John is understandably angry with her for dropping his name, yet he thinks nothing of eying attractive strangers, showing that neither puts a high priority on their marriage.

The Nakatomi Corporation itself is likewise thoroughly commercial, although not necessarily in a heartless way. Holly’s genial boss, Mr. Takagi, jokes, “Pearl Harbor didn’t work, so we got you with tape decks,” while cheerfully saying that they’re celebrating Christmas as “opportunists.” For the company, it’s all about profit, and while this doesn’t make them the bad guys by any stretch (Takagi is a thoroughly sympathetic character), it helps to set the stage.

Even the Police and Terrorists Are In On It

This same pattern plays out in the police, FBI, and press. It takes a long time for the police to even understand that John’s frantic calls for help are genuine, and when they do show up the arrogant police chief mindlessly throws expensive, hi-tech, and obviously unsuitable equipment at the problem. Later, the FBI agents simply follow the anti-terrorist playbook and callously shrug off the possibility of losing a fair percentage of the hostages. All the while, the press is only too happy to commoditize the disaster with sensationalist coverage, like interviews with a self-promoting and hilariously inaccurate “expert,” and forcing the McClane children into a live interview.

None of these characters (except John’s contact, Al) seem particularly concerned with their ostensible duties. The police and FBI show little concern for the hostages they are supposedly sworn to protect, instead showing more concern for their careers and egos. The same is true of the press, who don’t care about informing the public, but about what they can get out of the situation.

It’s just like how John and Holly McClane each selfishly pursue their careers at the expense of their family. This is a world where everything from family and marriage to the law to Christmas itself is automated and commoditized, not done from real passion or principle, but for what can be gotten out of it.

This very fact, much more than their weaponry, is what gives Hans and his men so much power. Hans knows full well how both the police and the corporation think and how to exploit them. Time and again the authorities fall into his traps because they simply follow mindless routines, just as he expects them too. His whole plan, in fact, depends upon the authorities being “regular as clockwork,” just as it depends on the building being largely automated.

The end goal is the same as Nakatomi corporation’s: money. Hans disguises his greed by playing the role of an ideological terrorist (something the film implies he once was) to throw off the police. He is thus commoditizing his once-sincerely held principles in order to make a profit. In other words, he’s doing exactly what so much of the modern world does to Christmas itself.

Contrast That with the Spirit of Christmas

That brings us to the other side of the equation. Against these forces of entrenched materialism are the more basic and meaningful factors of good and evil, family, love, and devotion. John McClane is established early on to be out of step with the modern, techno-corporate world. He doesn’t like flying and doesn’t know how to use the building computer, nor does he appreciate the fancy drink a waiter offers him at the party (he’s the only man not in a suit and tie).

All this is to signal that John is not quite like the other characters, because at the end of the day, and in spite of his rough edges, he is a principled man. This is definitively demonstrated in an early scene where he gets the drop on one of the terrorists and, despite the man being armed and uncooperative, John refrains from shooting him, opting to try to subdue him physically instead. This comes shortly after a scene where Hans cold-bloodedly murders an unarmed man, highlighting the difference between the two characters.

John, unlike Hans, the police, the media, and the corporation, has not lost sight of his principles. This means that when the fighting starts, he isn’t wedded to a mechanical formula. He is working towards one specific goal after another— to summon help, evade capture, and stop Hans’s plan, all with the guiding end of saving his family. That John is working for a principle rather than a routine allows him to see past the obvious and improvise solutions on the fly, as demonstrated by how he works his way up to more and more unconventional methods of summoning the authorities.

Over the course of the crisis, both John and Holly come to understand what they really value and how superficial and unimportant their argument is. Hans essentially forces the question upon them by putting both characters in a situation where the questions of life and death and love and hate are unmistakably real, and the fact of their marriage is inescapable. Both also express disgust when they learn Hans is “nothing but a common thief.” Having realized what truly matters, his materialistic goals seem ridiculously petty to them.

In summary, we have a story where one man is after pure material gain, using once-sincere beliefs as a disguise to get what he wants, while another man opposes him, fighting for his family and his principles. The bad guy depends upon people following routines because they’ve lost sight of their actual principles, while the hero succeeds because he hasn’t lost sight of them, and it all takes place on Christmas Eve. That sure sounds like a Christmas movie to me.

Here’s What We Know About The Alleged Attack On Actor Jussie Smollett,"Ever since Jussie Smollett, the star of “Empire” on Fox, reported that he was beaten by two masked men yelling racist and homophobic slurs early Tuesday morning, Chicago police have been slow to find corroborating evidence. TMZ and other outlets have corrected several of their initial reports of the alleged incident. Here is what we currently know.

1. Smollett Requested Police Turn Off Their Body Cameras; Was Wearing Noose When They Arrived

According to Chicago reporter Rob Elgas, when police arrived to take a report, Smollett asked that the officers turn off their body cameras. A Chicago Police Department spokesperson said this is not uncommon and that when entering a private residence, officers are supposed to inform citizens they are wearing cameras.

Chicago PD also said when they arrived at the apartment, Smollett was still wearing the noose attackers put around his neck, and others reported he wore it throughout their entire 40-minute interview.

CPD also says: when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

Using building security footage, Police confirmed that Smollett was, “wearing a rope like a neck tie,” when he walked into the lobby of his building.

2. Smollett Did Not Turn Over His Phone To Police

Several media outlets reported that Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records to police. He said he was on the phone with his manager when the attack happened, and the manager was the one who called 911 dispatch. However, TMZ is reporting a discrepancy with the description that he “refused.”

The sources say cops “informally asked” Jussie if he would surrender his phone … to verify he was talking to his manager on his cell when he was attacked. We’re told he felt “uncomfortable” doing that and declined, but he was never asked about phone records. A Chicago police official had said Jussie refused to turn over both the phone and records. We’re told Smollett has already said he will provide the records, and is in the process of gathering them.

In a statement given to ESSENCE Magazine Friday morning, Smollett said he is frustrated by inaccurate reports and that he is cooperating with police.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Elgas also noted that police do not have a warrant to search his phone records.

Chicago police also say Jussie Smollett is NOT the target or focus of any criminal investigation, he is the victim. Police have no interest or probable cause to obtain a warrant to search his phone records. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

3. No Video Evidence of the Attack, Police Release Person of Interest Images

Over a dozen police officers have been sifting through footage to piece together Smollett’s report. After searching for surveillance footage for over 24 hours and broadening their search, police finally located a camera with “potential persons of interest” around the time of the attack but the images are too dark to see any faces. They also found stretches of footage of Smollett’s walk from the Subway sandwich shop he was at to his apartment.

While video does not capture an encounter, detectives are taking this development seriously & wish to question individuals as more cameras are being reviewed pic.twitter.com/xJDDygtocr — Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) January 31, 2019

4. Smollett Never Said His Attackers Were White

Multiple media outlets ran TMZ’s report that the attackers were, “both white and wearing ski masks.”

As Robby Soave at Reason pointed out, a Chicago PD spokesperson denied that Smollett reported the attacker’s race. “According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesperson told Reason.

5. Attackers Allegedly Yelled ‘This is MAGA Country’

In the first police reported taken on Tuesday about 40 minutes after the attack, there is no mention of “MAGA.” But a police spokesperson has now told multiple outlets that when detectives followed up with Smollett later on Tuesday, he recalled the offenders making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

6. Police Are Investigating A Letter Sent To Smollett Last Week

Smollett received a threatening letter on the set of Empire more than a week before the attack. Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN the letter contained a white powder but it was determined to be aspirin.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net has reported to have obtained a picture of the letter (below) which includes a homophobic slur and what appears to be “MAGA” on the top right corner. Apparently, after receiving the letter, Fox wanted to get around the clock security guards for Smollett but he turned it down.

There’s still a lot we don’t know about the “Empire” star’s alleged attackers. News outlets should be scrupulous when combing through the facts of the case.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/01/heres-know-alleged-attack-actor-jussie-smollett/,2019-02-01
Mass Shooting In Aurora Shows Why Gun Control Doesn’t Work,"Last week, when an Illinois man killed five of his co-workers and injured several police officers, he did so with an illegal firearm. The shooter purchased the gun after lying on his background check about a past felony for aggravated assault. Like many other mass shootings, the criminal was able to carry out an act of violence not because of a lack of gun laws, but because of a bureaucratic failure to enforce the existing ones.

The Aurora shooter answered “No” to the question, “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?” He was then approved for his Firearm Owner’s Identification Card (FOID), which is required before purchasing a firearm or ammunition in Illinois. He then passed another background check before purchasing the .40-caliber Smith & Wesson he used on his killing rampage last week in Aurora. Both background checks failed to flag his felony conviction and prison sentence from the mid-1990s in Mississippi. Police reports say he hit a former girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbed her with a knife.

It wasn’t until Gary Martin later applied for a concealed carry permit that his felony was flagged and his FOID card revoked. He was sent a letter with orders to surrender his firearm but never did so, and it’s unclear if any police agency ever followed up. The Illinois State Police has yet to explain how their database missed his past convictions, or whether any measures were taken to seize his firearm after his FOID card was revoked. The Chicago Tribune reports there is no record of law enforcement asking the court for permission to search for Martin’s gun.

In a statement on Monday, Aurora police Chief Kristen Ziman said a criminal background check would not necessarily detect a 20-year-old conviction. But The Chicago Tribune and news outlets were easily able to find Martin’s aggravated assault in public records.

All licensed gun retailers are required to run a background check through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) any time they sell a firearm to an individual. But a background check system is only as effective as its database. The federal government cannot force states to submit prohibited information, like criminal and mental health records, to NICS. Unfortunately, far too many states fail to participate, and Illinois ranks 34th of states submitting records to NICS.

In 2011, an audit of Illinois’ FOID card program found “significant deficiencies in the reporting of individuals with potentially disqualifying mental health conditions” to state police. At the time of the audit, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart asked, “How are people going to explain away the fact that a horrific event occurred, and it turns out this person had diagnosed mental health issues and their card was not (taken away or) the information was never forwarded to the state police, so they never had the ability to take the card away?” Nine years later, this exact scenario has played out too many times.

Since the 2011 audit, Illinois has received millions of dollars in grants specifically for fixing problems with their database and automating the process of submitting disqualifying records to the NICS database. In 2018, Congress passed the Fix NICS Act, which required all federal agencies to submit any of their prohibitory records, and provided funding and resources for states to do the same (although the federal government still cannot compel states to do this).

This leaves many unanswered questions as to why states like Illinois continue to allow criminals to skirt gun laws already on the books. Is their failure to run background checks, or to submit records to the NICS, because of a lack of funding? A lack of technology? Are they continually updating their submitted records, or are they submitted in a one-time dump to the federal government? In the case of the Aurora shooting, was it Mississippi’s failure to submit the information of the shooter’s felony, or was it Illinois’ failure to find it?

The Charleston church shooting, the Sutherland Springs church shooting, and now the Aurora shooting are just three of the many recent mass shootings that could have been prevented had the background check system been properly enforced. In each of these tragedies, the shooters obtained firearms illegally. They were criminals before they even claimed a victim. These criminals are evidence that gun control measures do nothing to address the reality that criminals will never obey the law, but expose bureaucratic failures to enforce it.

Head Of Chicago Police Shames Jussie Smollett For ‘Phony Attack’,"Actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday for filing a false police report. On Thursday, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson held an emotional press conference, saying he was offended and angered by Smollett’s hoax.

Johnson shamed Smollett for exploiting racism, homophobia, and manipulating the painful symbol of a noose to further his career and public profile. Police say it is now clear that Smollett concocted the false story because he was dissatisfied with his salary.

“How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago, turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?” Johnson said. “Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do real harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators.”

“The accusations behind this phony attack received national attention for weeks — celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something choreographed by an actor,” police said of #JussieSmollett, who claimed he was attacked by Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/ZklRheaslc — POLITICO (@politico) February 21, 2019

A week before the alleged attack, Smollett reported receiving a threatening letter with a white powder at the Fox production studios in Chicago. When that stunt failed to receive attention, Smollett orchestrated the attack by paying two brothers he knew $3,500 to assault him while getting food around 2 a.m.

In the weeks following the alleged incident, Chicago police spent hours poring over security footage and devoting resources that could have been put toward real victims––like the 1-year-old baby who was shot twice in the head last week on Chicago’s South Side.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention, because that’s who really deserves the amount of attention that we’re giving to this particular incident,” Johnson said.

Johnson said he is also concerned that real hate crimes will now be met publicly with skepticism:

“I’m also concerned about what this means moving forward for hate crimes. Now of course, the Chicago Police Department all reports of these types of incidents with the same amount of vigor that we did with this one. But my concern is that now hate crimes will publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.”

He also called out the circus of media figures who rushed to make Smollett’s report a national story:

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve. To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks. Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor.”

"Facts About Mass Shootings Support Gun Ownership, Not Gun Control","On February 14, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) marked the one-year anniversary of a horrific school shooting by threatening that President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall could be used as precedent for future gun control.

Calling the 2018 massacre of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America,” Pelosi remarked, “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President?”

“A Democratic president,” she threatened, “can do that.”

By painting the tragic Parkland shooting as a failure of gun control, however, Pelosi disregards the indisputable fact that the shooter’s rampage was enabled by years-long, system-wide failures of policy and personnel.

Andrew Pollack, the father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, is on a campaign to hold those who failed the Parkland victims accountable. This includes the resource officer and deputies whose inadequate response allowed the shooting spree to continue for 11 long minutes, the FBI officials who ignored a tip about the shooter’s intentions just over a month prior to the attack, the Broward County superintendent whose “Promise” program kept students’ criminal activities from being reported to police, and the school officials, mental health providers, and officials from the Broward Sheriff’s Office who ignored a series of red flags, not to mention murderer’s lengthy history of violence and mental health issues.

These Tragedies Happened Despite Legal Barriers

Judging by the sheer number of pending legal claims against Broward Country Public Schools (103 as of December 2018), Pollack is not the only parent of a victim or survivor to find that fault extends beyond the shooter and his weapon. The families of two Parkland victims are also filing suit against the manufacturer of Cruz’s AR-15, and the store where he purchased it.

On Friday, just one day after Pelosi threatened future gun control initiatives, America experienced another preventable and horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois. After he was fired from his job, Gary Martin used a pistol he unlawfully possessed to shoot employees in his workplace. Martin killed six employees, and wounded five of the police officers who responded to the scene before he was killed by police.

As a convicted felon, Martin should not have possessed a weapon. When applying for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card in January 2014, he lied about his previous felony conviction for aggravated assault. After he purchased his pistol in March, Martin also applied for a concealed carry permit. When the fingerprinting process revealed Martin’s criminal history in Mississippi, police turned down Martin’s application, revoked his FOID card, and informed him that he must relinquish his weapon within 48 hours. Instead, Martin kept the pistol.

Non-compliance with police orders regarding weapons and FOID turnover is not uncommon. In 2018, 10,818 FOID cards were revoked by the Illinois State Police, who admitted on Monday that “in most instances” a weapon and official record are not returned. Law enforcement is able to petition a judge for a search warrant to retrieve guns that are not turned over, but according to Illinois law, they are not required to do so.

In Aurora, existing gun laws failed. In Parkland, a host of authorities and policies failed. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.

Pelosi’s threat of future gun control initiatives does not stand alone. During the 2018 midterm elections, more candidates aired “spots promot[ing] gun control than oppos[ing] it.” In the wake of the Aurora attack, Democratic presidential candidates are loudly decrying gun violence, and advocating for stricter gun control measures.

Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. Last Wednesday, while the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to require background checks on every gun sale or transfer, Democrats rejected Republicans’ efforts to add an amendment that would ensure law enforcement is notified “when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check.”

Most Americans Favor Legal Gun Ownership

A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. According to a March 2018 poll, 58 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “increase[s] public safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.”

James Craig, who returned to his native Detroit as its chief of police in June 2013, believes in the strength of a legally armed populace. After working as a police officer for nearly three decades in Los Angeles, “where ‘it took an act of Congress’ to get permission to carry a gun,” Craig transferred to Portland, Maine. There, he discovered a vastly safer city, and one where gun ownership was common. It was in Portland that Craig realized “the effect…good Americans who are armed can have on reducing violence.”

Prior to Craig’s arrival, Detroit was among the most violent cities in the country. According to FBI statistics, 80 in 1000 Detroit residents “became victims of violent or property crime each year.” In 2012, 386 criminal homicides had been reported in the city. To bring down crime rates, the new chief of police urged Detroit residents to legally and safely arm themselves.

In 2014, Craig’s department issued 1,100 handgun permits. That year, the number of home invasions decreased by 38 percent, with the numbers of shootings and robberies likewise decreasing. Of the 1,800 felons queried in a 2015 survey, 57 percent identified their biggest fear as “armed citizens.”

Since Craig took over the department, Detroit has experienced “double-digit drops” in “nonfatal shootings, robberies, and carjackings.” Although the city’s levels of violence still leave much to be desired, in 2017, Detroit recorded its “lowest number of homicides since 1966.”

Craig believes a conversation surrounding guns should not be about gun control, but “crime control.” As he explains, “individuals who are criminally inclined…when in possession of a weapon, create the problems.”

Before Democrats look to new measures of gun control, they should concern themselves with the enforcement of existing gun laws, keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, and holding accountable institutions and policies which allow threats to go undetected.

If Democrats impede law-abiding Americans from arming themselves to protect their fellow citizens, and themselves, then the only people with access to weapons will be those who purchase them illegally, with criminal intent.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/21/facts-mass-shootings-support-gun-ownership-not-gun-control/,2019-02-21
Dropping Jussie Smollett Charges Says It’s Okay To Lie If You’re Woke,"As far as the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office is concerned, lying about a hate crime is not such a big deal. By deciding to drop charges against former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollet for having faked a hate crime in an apparent deal in which his records would be sealed and no apology required for the costs he had inflicted on the city, the authorities effectively gave him a pass for all he had done.

Yet rather than ending the controversy, the deal—which Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel rightly declared was “not on the level”—created a brand-new furor. The outcome was at least in part the result of political squabbles between the police and the prosecutors. It was also clearly a product of Smollett’s privileged status in which his legal representative and support from influential friends made it possible for him to avoid being held accountable.

While some are attributing this miscarriage of justice solely to Smollett’s wealth and status as yet another example of the “varsity blues”-type scandal (the one in which rich people bought their children places in elite colleges), there is another dynamic at play here that also needs to be confronted.

Are Minority People Oppressed if Wealthy and Powerful?

This is also a product of a belief that those who hold the status of oppressed minorities have a different kind of privilege. They are to be considered victims even if they are wealthy or have power. Thus even if the stories they tell about being victimized by members of groups that are not minorities are untrue, they are to be held harmless for lying because their false narratives speak to a supposedly greater truth about white privilege and racism.

Much like intersectional theory, that holds that the struggle for civil rights in the United States for African-Americans is linked to all efforts by those who considered themselves oppressed, whether or not the analogy is justified, the problem is conflating causes and intentions that give advocates a belief that they can do no wrong. Even, as in the case of Smollett, where lies do great damage to the cause of equality and cast doubt on genuine hate crimes, there is a sense that accountability isn’t necessary.

The Smollett case may be about wealth and privilege, but the end result would be unimaginable without the identity politics that created an audience for the actor’s lies and political forces that were ready to sweep it under the carpet once it became inconvenient. That disconnect between the truth and the rhetoric of some who purport to advocate for civil rights has produced a conversation about race that is both fundamentally dishonest and feeding divisions that can only contribute to more hate.

The entire country’s attention had focused on what we were initially told was an atrocity in which Smollett — a gay, black man — had been taunted by white supporters of President Donald Trump. He was supposedly beaten, doused with chemicals, and had a noose put around his neck.

Smollett was, albeit briefly, a symbol of all that is wrong with Trump’s America. It was a place where hooded thugs wearing “Make America Great Again” hats could victimize someone for his race and sexual orientation. Smollett’s celebrity and relative wealth was, we were told, no defense against hate.

‘America in 2019’ Was Not as Simple as It Seemed

But within days of the chattering classes embracing the story as a metaphor for, in CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin’s words, “America in 2019,” the story fell apart. Once the Chicago Police Department investigated the alleged attack, they quickly discovered that the two men who supposedly beat Smollett were of African heritage, that they actually knew him, and that one had appeared as an extra on his show “Empire.”

After being questioned, they admitted that Smollett had hired them to help stage a hoax whose purpose was to give the actor some publicity because he was unhappy with his “Empire” salary. The case was brought before a grand jury, and Smollett was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct. From being the new poster child for victims of Trump-era hate crimes against black and gay people, Smollett had become a symbol of something else: a rich, entitled person who believed he could profit from faking a crime.

But two months after the controversy began, the prosecution of Smollett was dropped. His hoax had led to enormous costs, as the police were forced to expand massive amounts of time and manpower on investigating a crime that hadn’t happened, but prosecutors were prepared to treat it as an unimportant, victimless crime.

The decision seemed at least in part to stem from ongoing tensions between the State’s Attorney’s Office and the Chicago Police Department. State’s Attorney Kim Foxx was forced to recuse herself from the case, because thanks to the efforts of a lawyer who had been Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, she had been in contact with a relative of Smollett early in the investigation.

But her deputy Joe Magats seemed to do her bidding by deciding to simply let Smollett off the hook with no apology, a few hours of community service, and the forfeit of a $10,000 bond (a drop in the bucket when compared to the enormous costs the investigation had prompted). Smollett even had the chutzpah to make a public statement that he had been “truthful and consistent on every level since Day 1,” even though Magats had conceded that there were no problems with the police investigation that led the grand jury to find he had consistently lied.

Magat’s disgraceful decision earned him and Foxx’s office a scathing denunciation from Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. That Smollett had benefitted from a whitewash was not in doubt.

This can be considered just another example of the corruption that is endemic in Chicago and the anodyne observation that rich people fare better in the criminal justice system than the poor in any locality. But it’s just as obvious that Smollett benefitted from the identity politics that drives much of the conversation about race in this country.

Smollett Knew the Country Would Believe Him

Smollett may have been a sloppy criminal, since the police easily discovered his deception. But he was not wrong to think that the country would believe his bizarre story without hesitation because the media is hungry for stories that will “prove” that their anger and disgust with Trump and his supporters is justified. Smollett understood that, in this hyper-partisan and divisive moment in our history, many Americans are all too ready to view politics through a racial lens that will not merely bring attention to discrimination and hate but also discredit everyone with whom they disagree.

Hoaxes like this or the ones that falsely accused the Duke Lacrosse team and a University of Virginia fraternity of racist and sexual violence may discourage victims of genuine hate crimes from coming forward. Whether or not that is true, what is at stake here is that, by essentially clearing someone who manufactured a hate crime, the Chicago prosecutors have validated the notion that so long as the purpose of a lie about race is to bring attention to hate against blacks and gays, it is not something for which anyone truly needs to apologize.

Once the struggle against racism and violence gets mixed up with notions about race in which truth is subordinated to political theories, cases like Smollett’s are inevitable. Allowing him to not only walk free but also to continue brazenly spreading lies is a disgrace. But it also contributes to a dishonest conversation about race that makes it impossible to draw a distinction between political disagreements and the necessary struggle to extinguish hate against all who are subjected to discrimination.

Wealth and privilege that is essentially colorblind helped Smollett stay out of the jail cell where he belongs. But the identity politics that is at the heart of much of our national discussion about race is what made this dispiriting tale possible in the first place.

Chicago Sues Smollett For Refusing To Cover Cost Of Investigating Hoax,"After former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett cost the city of Chicago $130,000 in police overtime hours working on his allegedly staged racist and homophobic attack, they asked him to pay the bill. On Thursday, Smollett missed the deadline to pay up, so now officials are taking him to court.

“Mr. Smollett has refused to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29, 2019,” said spokesman Bill McCaffrey in a statement. “The Law Department is now drafting a civil complaint that will be filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County.”

A week ago, a lawyer for the City of Chicago sent Smollett a letter asserting that the false police report caused Chicago Police to divert “resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system.” After the city fined Smollett $130,000, Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, responded saying his client “will not be intimidated into paying the demanded sum.”

Meanwhile, Chicago police are speaking out against Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx after she dismissed the 16 felony charges against Smollett. On Wednesday, the police chiefs of three Chicago suburban police departments and the head of the police union announced “no confidence” against Foxx. On Thursday at a press conference, they called for her resignation.

“What she is doing is enabling the offenders; bad guys are not being held accountable,” said Chief Steven Stelter, of the West Suburban Chiefs Association.

Foxx responded in a statement, saying that she will not resign: “I was elected by the people of Cook County to pursue community safety, prevent harm, and uphold the values of fairness and equal justice. I’m proud of my record in doing that, and I plan to do so through the end of my term and, if the people so will it, into the future.”

Foxx has been criticized for her ties to a family friend of Smollett’s, Tina Tchen, Michele Obama’s former chief of staff.

When Foxx announced Smollett’s charges had been dropped, she said his community service was a sufficient payment for his crimes. “Based on the nature of the offense and his background, this was a just outcome,” she said. “Justice takes many forms.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/chicago-sues-smollett-refuses-cover-cost-investigating-hoax/,2019-04-05
This Hate Crime Helps Show How To Know Real Ones From Hoaxes,"In national conversations about hate crimes, members of the media tend to rely on emotional rhetoric rather than rational evaluation of the facts. Despite aggravated assault making up 19.5 percent of hate crimes in 2017, the idea of random acts of hate-motivated violence inspires most of the fear and activism against hate crimes nationwide. Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons in 2017 in all categories, 79 percent were nonviolent.

To the public imagination, though, the concept of hate crimes conjures images of innocent people being targeted and brutally attacked merely for who they are. Despite many highly publicized incidents turning out to be hoaxes, hate crimes still drive a great deal of media attention. We have become accustomed to making arguments decrying the potential for true victims to be further victimized by lack of public trust in media and that real hate crimes do still happen. Here is an example of one of those true cases.

In July 2018, around 3:30 a.m., 24-year-old Brandon M. Wiley told the police that a 39-year-old gay man propositioned him and grabbed him in a sexual manner. In response, he beat the man, then later posted bloody pictures of himself on social media bragging about the assault.

The victim of the assault was found by police after a security guard witnessed the assault and suffered “multiple serious facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets.” In April 2019, Wiley pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and police confirmed with video and witnesses that the victim had not molested him. Hate crime charges have been added, and Wiley is scheduled for sentencing in June.

What Makes This Hate Crime Plausible?

Multiple factors of this story illustrate the anatomy of a true hate crime. The first, and most important factor, was a neutral third party. A security guard just happened to pass by when the assault happened and was able to see specific details. Witnesses are one of the most important pieces of evidence as they allow more than one perspective to the crime. Hoax hate crimes often lack eyewitnesses or, if one is present, such witnesses have a bias towards the victim and may not be an objective source of truth.

In addition to eyewitnesses, the most affecting source of evidence comes from video or audio recordings of the event. In this case, security cameras caught the entire interaction between the two individuals. This allowed the police a straightforward view into the factual events. Security footage may not reveal verbal evidence, but in this case the attacker claimed the victim first assaulted him by grabbing his crotch. This was quickly disproven by the video evidence.

Police found the victim lying on the ground where the assault occurred, and he was taken to the hospital. Immediately going to the hospital is a powerful indicator of legitimate injury also, as it does not allow for staging or exaggeration of events.

Again, the victim had multiple witnesses to his injuries and was evaluated by medical professionals rather than taking a bloody selfie and posting it on social media or waiting until later to go to the hospital. The police were informed by a third party, in this case the security guard, and allowed the facts to be objectively recorded without outside influence. The first person to interact with the victim post-attack was the police officer, which significantly strengthens the case.

One of the most revealing aspects of this case is the pride the attacker took in his actions. He posted pictures of himself immediately afterwards, positioning himself as the victim and bragging about severely beating the man. He clearly intended for the public to know his motivations and felt justified in his actions.

A widely overlooked aspect in the narrative about a hateful population intentionally targeting minorities for violence is that we rarely see attackers bragging about their actions. It would seem reasonable that if people truly despise LGBT people to such an extent that they feel compelled to physically attack them in public, there would be more public celebration of such attacks.

Perpetrator Motives and Victim Reaction

A Texas study of hate crimes found that most reported hate crimes never identify a suspect and many are dismissed due to little or no evidence. It seems that the media assumes perpetrators of hate crimes simply wish to attack individuals of hated groups for the satisfaction alone rather than as a (perceived) political or social message.

In this case, the victim did admit to the police to propositioning the attacker. While a wildly inappropriate response, it is at least a reason that explains the attack. Too often we are simply asked to believe random citizens roam the streets looking for members of marginalized groups to assault for the sheer joy of the act.

Another unique property of this crime is that it took several months to collect sufficient evidence to properly prosecute the attacker with local reports updating the case. Too often, hate crimes receive a large, public announcement and rarely involve resolution or follow-up. This case was reported locally and in several LGBT news sources, but never achieved nationwide attention or outrage. This allowed the police and prosecution to gather evidence and build a case.

One overlooked quality of this case that significantly distinguishes it from most reported hate crimes is that the victim is not publicly named. Typically, an alleged victim immediately turns to social media or the press and tells his or her story before any investigation can be conducted.

In this case, even though he was viciously beaten over a minor infraction, he chose not to take this route. He was attacked, went to the hospital, gave an honest police report, and allowed justice to be properly served as he healed and rebuilt his life. While he deserves public sympathy for the attack, he did not seek fame or money. This says a great deal about the legitimacy of the incident.

Would Extra Laws Really Deter Hate Crimes? Not Likely

This was a hate crime because the attacker reacted to the proposition with extreme violence and bragged about attacking the victim, a gay man. The gay man took a chance in a moment of weakness late at night in a bar, and did not deserve to be viciously beaten. But an important question is: what law would have prevented this attack?

Although a terrible situation and unfortunate experience of engaging with the wrong person in the wrong scenario, the assault on its own was already illegal. Although a hate crime charge increases sentencing, is this going to influence Wiley’s future choices or his views on gay men or his own sexuality, which inspired the assault to begin with? Will the hate crime charges prevent a similar irrational young man from doing the same?

One of the unfortunate rhetorical media reactions, especially in LGBT advocacy, is the outrage that the violent incident occurred in the first place. They insist the same could happen to all LGBT people nationwide, and that the incident is evidence of a larger pattern. But this situation is far more of an outlier than a pattern. In fact, it’s the bold honesty of the attacker about his motivations that makes this story stand out as shocking and disturbing. Our collective agreement that this is morally wrong should be evidence enough that no one supports violence against LGBT people.

It is equally as important to recognize legitimate hate crimes as it is to report on the abuse of public sympathy and compassion with high-profile hoaxes. We should recognize that, despite the unfair imbalance of hoaxes to legitimate crimes, the police take reports seriously and do everything in their power to get justice for victims.

Unfortunately, it takes a real hate crime with a satisfying resolution for us to appreciate just how safe and protected LGBT individuals are in our society. The police and our justice system should be thanked for this.

Cops Shouldn’t React Harshly To Moms Who Won't Put Down Their Babies,"Citizen footage starting in the middle of an interaction between a police officer pointing a gun into a car with a pregnant woman, her one- and four-year-old children, and their father inside has gone viral. The Phoenix Police Department is now facing a $10 million lawsuit due to the incident, which happened late last month. Last Thursday, a notice of claim was filed alleging “police brutality and civil rights violations,” azfamily.com reported.

The father of the children, Dravon Ames, was in the driver’s seat when the police confrontation allegedly began, some time after the family had left a dollar store with a shoplifted Barbie doll. According to the family, five to 10 minutes had passed before the filming started. You can watch the most complete footage I have found here (warning: it is full of expletives and may be difficult to watch for sensitive viewers).

An officer can be clearly seen pointing a gun into the car for at least 30 continuous seconds and shouting profanity-laced commands at the couple. The mother, Iesha Harper, can be heard pleading with the officer not to point a gun at her kids and telling them she’s pregnant.

Once outside the car, an officer rushes up to her and points an index finger in her face, shouting, “When I tell you to put your hands up, you put your f-cking hands up.”

“I couldn’t put my hands up. I had a f-cking baby!” she cries. “What the f-ck are you talking about?”

Harper is ordered to set her child down; she jerks away as the police officer attempts to grab her by the arm. As the confrontation escalates, Harper changes position, putting more of her body in between the officers and the baby on her hip. One of the officers demands again, “Put the child down,” to which Harper screams, “She don’t walk! She’s a baby!”

Previous debates over escalated police encounters have centered on citizen compliance and an officer’s “reasonable belief” that the citizen may be a physical threat to the officer or others. “Reasonable belief” has been cited in cases where a subject reaches out of view, such as toward the small of his back, or into his pocket, or rapidly pulls out something that may resemble a weapon at first glimpse.

In 2016, Daniel Shaver was shot dead in Mesa Arizona while attempting to comply with a series of very specific commands from an officer. He had reached back, presumably to pull his shorts up, while slowly crawling toward the officer at his command. That officer was acquitted, to the outrage of people across the political spectrum.

Although no one was shot in the Ames-Harper incident, it calls into question the idea that any delay or brief lapse in compliance lies somewhere on the spectrum between resisting arrest to evincing a threat. An officer training a gun on a pregnant woman and her small children sheds a bright light on the lack of nuance in “compliance/non-compliance” doctrine that we might miss in confrontations between adult males.

Ames’s behavior should of course be examined to discern whether Harper’s treatment was largely a byproduct of a reasonable response to Ames’s resistance or threatening behavior. According to reporting by azfamily.com, the police report states the officer “drew his gun because Ames ‘began to reach towards the center of the vehicle between the front seats.’” No weapon was reported at the scene, however, and neither adult was charged with resisting arrest.

Would a “reasonable and prudent” officer in that position draw a gun and threaten to “put a f-cking cap right in your f-cking head” for a reason as vague as “reaching toward the center of the vehicle?” And if that standard were applied to anyone pulled over for a potential petty crime, how many drivers would end up shot?

Yet what appears, based on the partial footage currently available, to be highly unreasonable behavior doesn’t end there. The other officer continued to point a gun into a car with a pregnant mother and children in it even after Ames had exited the vehicle and was well under officer control. Is being “loud, verbally abusive, and refusing” to put hands up and exit the vehicle, as Harper’s behavior was described in the police report, an excuse to point a gun and scream profanities at her?

If the audio of Harper’s voice is to be believed, she was holding, or holding onto, at least one child at the time. Holding onto your child, as a mother, is not the same as holding onto a briefcase or a bowling ball. Mothers like myself know that when you feel your baby’s safety is being threatened, as by all the available evidence it was in Harpers’ case, you do not let go.

This may not seem “logical” to those who are not mothers or who have only had peaceful, trusting encounters with law enforcement. Why can’t she just obey? How hard is that?

But a reasonable response for a mother at gunpoint, with the adrenaline pumping through her system, who is intensely focused on the safety of her two born children and one just five months along, is far different. It could be very close to physically impossible for her to release her grip on her baby in such a circumstance, no matter how many times “an officer in uniform” demands she separate herself from the most precious life in the world to her.

From my perspective as a pregnant mother with a toddler, Harper did everything a reasonable mother would do, from holding onto her baby like her tiny life depended on it, to begging the officer not to point the gun at her children. It shouldn’t matter that she was “loud” and that her responses were laced with profanity (and to no greater extent than the officers who were commanding her).

According to the Phoenix Police Department Operations Manual:

A. It is the policy of the Department to use a reasonable amount of force to conduct lawful public safety activities. B. The response option employed will be reasonable and based on the totality of circumstances… (2) Circumstances that may govern the reasonableness of using a particular force option include, but are not limited to: The severity of the crime Whether the subject poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others Whether the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight” (emphasis mine).

If police responses are “determined by the totality of the circumstances,” then a pregnant woman holding a baby, having just come from the Dollar Store, shouldn’t be considered a threat. The Venn diagram between mothers who shoplift (or allow their child to shoplift) $5 dolls and people who assault police officers is not huge. In addition, her form-fitting dress didn’t leave much, if any, room to conceal a weapon between herself and her baby (as if that were even a plausibility).

Even if one views Ames’s delay in compliance as resistance, the “threat” assumed after he “reached toward the center of the vehicle” should have passed when Ames was removed from the vehicle and under officer control. Yet Harper was still at gunpoint while Ames’s legs were being kicked apart several yards away. They proceeded to aggressively demand she put her baby down and attempted to restrain her, even once she was out of the car and clearly visible as a non-threat.

If we are to place such a great benefit of the doubt with officers as to what is a “reasonable” response, maybe we should consider what is a reasonable response from the citizen they’re interacting with. Shaver was shot dead after briefly reaching toward his haunches, despite every indication, over minutes, that he was trying his best to obey the officer. Harper was verbally abused and threatened for doing what any mother would have done when put at gunpoint by a man who had just been screaming at the top of his voice that her partner in the drivers’ seat would “f-cking get shot.”

The police uniform does not automatically bestow an officer with the full confidence of the residents he or she is policing, especially for demographics that have historically been subject to harsher standards and more suspicion than the rest of the population. To insist the uniform itself should elicit such faith and trust, to the point of overriding even the most basic maternal and self-preservation instincts, is not just wishful thinking, but dangerous.

It’s a marvel no one got shot on that afternoon in late May. A cop’s actions in the moment convey much more meaning than the badge on his vest, and the more seriously law enforcement take that, the safer and more constructive their interactions with the community will be.

How To Talk To Your Kids About Their Rights If They're Stopped By Police,"As parents, we don’t want to think about our children having a negative interaction with law enforcement. Ideally, we’d like to think that all experiences between our families and law enforcement will be positive and minimally stressful, but this is unfortunately not always the case.

Recent stories like that of Dravon Ames and his pregnant fiancee Iesha Harper in Phoenix, Arizona, highlight how sometimes simple situations can rapidly spiral out of control. Ames’ and Harper’s four-year-old daughter left a Family Dollar store with a doll without paying for it, leading to an expletive-laden confrontation with police threatening to shoot both parents, including Harper, who was holding a baby.

Police Sometimes Abuse Their Power

People make mistakes. Kids pick things up and take them, but parents shouldn’t fear for their very lives—and those of their children—because of a preschooler’s mistake. Shoplifting is a low-level crime in America, nor should children be exposed to swearing, especially phrases like, “I’m gonna put a f——g cap in your f——g head” from authorities directed at their parents.

Watching the video of Harper and Ames’s experience with the police is difficult. You can hear the frightened children in the background, terrified of what would happen to them and their parents. I would suggest, if you watch it, you do so without your children there because of the strong nature of the language the police use.

This isn’t the only negative interaction between a family and the police to hit the news in recent months, and for parents, it’s cause for concern. Black parents have long been having conversations with their children on how to be smart in their interactions with police, and it’s long past time for all parents to sit their kids down and have some age-appropriate discussions on how to handle interactions with law enforcement. Having these talks isn’t fun or easy, but could smooth the waters in a high-stress situation if your kids ever find themselves part of an escalating altercation.

How To Teach Your Kids How To Interact with Cops

First, take your kids through a run-down of what our rights are as Americans. How in-depth you go will depend on how old they are. The littlest kids aren’t going to sit through a long civics lecture here, but it should be an evolving conversation, starting with some history on why we have the Fourth Amendment.

Talk to them about our country’s formation and how important those initial fights over illegal search and seizure were, and where our place in defending that fits in. Also talk to them about when to dig in and fight to protect our rights, and when to pull back if in a dangerous situation where a police officer is unlikely to be reasoned with. Parents can teach their kids prudence, and this will serve them in every single part of their lives.

For older kids who have their own phones, parents should talk with them about their legal rights to record law enforcement. This is a lesson about the First Amendment for those teens (or preteens). Talk to them about why it’s legal, as found by so many courts across our nation, to record civil servants, including peace officers:

The courts’ primary rationale for allowing police officer recording is that the First Amendment includes the right to freely discuss our government, and the right of freedom of the press and public access to information. Given the prevalence of personal filming devices, more and more ‘news’ is being gathered and disseminated by members of the public. The courts have found that freedom of the press applies to citizen journalists and documentarians just as it does to formal members of the press. (See, for example, Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011).)

Having a recording of the whole interaction can be incredibly helpful, and help kids feel like they’re doing something during a difficult situation in which they would otherwise have no reasonable actions to take.

Basic Respect and Good Protocol to Implement

Talk to your children about being respectful. This might seem beyond obvious, but it isn’t always. Keep your hands in view and don’t reach into your pockets without telling police what you’re doing (and what you’re reaching for). Realize that law enforcement officials see a lot of situations where things have been dangerous for them, and they don’t know what’s in your pocket. It could be a cell phone or a wallet, but it could be something else.

Take hats off in the car. Don’t obscure your face or signal affiliation with a group that could escalate a stressful situation.

Listen to what is going on and being said. Sometimes what the officers are telling people to do might seem wrong to kids, but it is not the child’s job to argue about that in the moment. Typically, officers are there to help. They are first responders on the scenes of accidents and disasters, providing aid. They guard houses of worship when there are threats. They put their lives in danger to protect others, and kids should be encouraged to remember that police serve important and valuable roles.

Still, when things are going wrong, or look like they’re about to go wrong, it’s not the time to escalate or get combative. The time to address overreach and infringement of rights is afterward, when the situation is resolved and people are safe. Review the situation, and let your kids know that, later on, they can engage in another long-standing American tradition: litigating to protect our rights.

Explain to your children that we are all part of a larger society, and it’s entirely possible to work toward being part of the solution for making America safer. You can respect our law enforcement and the difficult job that they do, while also holding them accountable when they abuse their power. It is the checks and balances, uniquely entrenched in American life and legal culture, that positions us to work toward solutions that make sure no family has to be threatened by those whose job it is to keep us safe.

Buttigieg Faces Race-Related Backlash After South Bend Police Shooting,"Democrat presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigeig faced intense backlash in a South Bend town hall after a local police officer fatally shot a robbery suspect.

On June 23, South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill responded to a 9-1-1 call about car break-ins near the Central High apartment complex in the downtown area. Suspect Eric J. Logan was allegedly holding a knife and refused to drop it after O’Neill ordered him to.

O’Neill’s body camera and dashboard camera were inactive during the incident. According to South Bend police, their body cameras and dashboard cameras activate when officer’s emergency lights go off. O’Neill’s lights were not on, as he was looking for the suspect in a parking lot. He eventually found Logan in a car and made contact with him to ensure he was the rightful owner of that car.

According to police accounts, Logan then threw a knife at O’Neill, who responded by fatally shooting the man.

According to Logan’s family, he had no past record of theft, although his brother said he did have some drug problems. St. Joseph County Circuit Court records say Logan did have previous run-ins with law enforcement, including possession of coke and narcotics, a handgun violation, and dealing of coke and narcotics.

Logan’s family is also upset that he was taken to the hospital in a police cruiser instead of an ambulance. O’Neill called for an ambulance after the shooting, but it didn’t arrive quickly, so police say another officer suggested O’Neill drive Logan to the hospital to get him treatment more quickly, given his injuries.

Buttigieg has come under scrutiny for the shooting as the South Bend Police have not hired as many non-white officers as some say they should. O’Neill was white and Logan was black, which only adds to the tensions over this incident in South Bend and the national debate about policing in minority communities.

“We have tried but not succeeded to increase diversity in the police department and we need help,” Buttigieg said the town hall on Sunday.

South Bend residents who showed up at the meeting expressed anger at Buttigieg and the South Bend Police. Crime has been a long-term problem in South Bend, and this incident highlights Buttigieg’s failure to address the problem during his seven years as mayor.

During the town hall, members of the community ridiculed Buttigieg and the police chief for their alleged inability to eliminate the police force of racists.

“Put them at the desk, make them do paperwork. Put the people that care about the fact that you different than me … make them the ones out there on the streets,” a South Bend community member said.

Due to the shooting, Buttigieg is taking time away from his 2020 presidential campaign to focus on his hometown. He has been nearly inactive on Twitter since the shooting. His only tweets have been to encourage South Bend citizens to attend the town hall and thanking city personnel who helped during a tornado that hit the South Bend area.

“Pete has a black problem,” said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio). “I don’t know one black person out of Indiana that supports him.” Fudge is the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Buttigieg trails behind current Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden by 13 points in his home state. In a South Carolina survey of 595 individuals, 18 percent of white voters said they would vote for Buttigieg, but 0 percent of black voters said they would.

Is Buttigieg Telling The Truth About Why He Fired A Black Police Chief?,"Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been under fire since a white police officer shot and killed an African-American man a week ago. But Buttigieg’s estrangement from the local black community dates back to 2012 when the newly elected mayor fired the city’s first African-American police chief.

On Sunday the nation got its first glimpse of the racial divide threatening to destroy Buttigieg’s presidential ambitions when CNN ran clips of the townhall the mayor held in South Bend. Unlike the friendly gatherings of Democratic primary voters that have occupied Buttigieg’s time over the last month, the black community in this mid-sized college town showed only anger at him.

Sunday’s outrage focused on the shooting death of Eric Logan by South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill. In a press conference held after the shooting, state Prosecutor Ken Cotter stated that O’Neill confronted Logan in response to a 9-1-1 report about car break-ins. O’Neill told his superiors that he shot Logan after the suspect approached him with a knife drawn and ignored multiple orders to drop the weapon. Logan died after officers rushed him to a nearby hospital in their squad car.

Since then, racial tensions in South Bend have escalated. Buttigieg’s attempt to calm the community during Sunday’s townhall-styled listening session backfired, with the young mayor only further enraging the crowd. The black community’s disdain for Buttigieg pre-dates Logan’s shooting death, however, to Buttigieg’s firing of the city’s first black police chief, Darryl Boykins.

Buttigieg Fired Boykins After Racist Tapes Surfaced

Boykins, who had worked his way up to police chief after starting with the department in 1984 as a patrolman, served in that position from 2007 until March 2012, when Buttigieg replaced him with a white police chief. The surrounding circumstances have long roiled the black community and raised still-unaddressed concerns in the northern Indiana town of a department-wide problem of racism. Known locally as the “police tapes” scandal, Boykins’ firing followed the discovery that department had recorded the telephone calls of several South Bend police officers.

According to the local U.S. attorney’s office, the South Bend Police Department “had a practice over many years of recording certain police phone lines and radio communications, but not all phone lines.” In a letter provided to Boykins’ attorney, the U.S. attorney’s office explained that their investigation into the department’s practice revealed that “the Police Chief would inform the Director of Communications on which lines should be recorded and historically all 911 calls and all police radio traffic were recorded.”

Additionally, “lines usually recorded were police front desk lines, the Chief’s office lines, a line for internal affairs, the main detective bureau line, and most of the division chiefs’ lines.” In approximately 2010, “during a change in leadership at the detective bureau, the Chief of the Detective Bureau’s line was mistakenly not recorded and the line assigned to one of the detectives in the bureau was mistakenly recorded instead,” the letter read. “Once this was learned, the recording on that line continued.”

After police communications director Karen DePaepe heard on the tapes what she described in court filings as “discriminatory racial comments of high ranking officers” in the department, and “something I believe to be possibly illegal,” she told police chief Boykins about the conversations and handed him numerous cassette tapes that had captured the telephone calls.

Others in the police department got wind of the recordings, leading one or more of the officers taped on the line to complain to the local U.S. attorney’s office in January 2012. The local U.S. attorney’s office then “asked the FBI to commence an investigation because the interception of telephone conversation could violate the Wiretap Act,” the letter to Boykins’ attorney explained.

Buttigieg, According to Lawsuit: Resign or Be Fired

Then, at the end of March, according to a race discrimination lawsuit Boykins later filed, Buttigieg’s chief of staff (or the local equivalent), Michael “Schmuhl met with Boykin on Buttigieg’s instruction, and threatened Boykins with both a federal criminal prosecution and employment termination if Boykins did not ‘voluntarily’ resign his post as Chief of Police.”

Boykins further alleged that during this meeting, Schmuhl led him “to believe that, through prior meetings between the Mayor and the United States Attorney, Buttigieg had struck a deal with the U.S. Attorney, whereby the U.S. Attorney would agree not to prosecute Boykins for violations of the federal wiretap act if Boykins would agree to the demotion.”

Boykins resigned, but shortly after attempted to rescind his resignation. Yet Buttigieg refused to allow Boykins to rescind his resignation, instead returning him to the department in a demoted position.

Many in the black community condemned the newly elected mayor for firing the police chief and demanded Buttigieg release the tapes. Buttigieg refused, prompting the city council to file suit to access the recordings. That case is still pending, and the public still does not know the content of the recordings—just the claims that they contain racist conversations.

Buttigieg Blames U.S. Attorney’s Office

As criticism mounted over Buttigieg’s firing of the city’s first black police chief, Buttigieg began to publicly point his finger at the U.S. attorney’s office. In his political memoir “Shortest Way Home,” the mayor detailed his version of the events:

A few weeks into the job of mayor, I learned that my newly reappointed police chief was being investigated by the FBI. Eventually a message came through, thinly veiled but quite clear, from federal prosecutors: the people responsible for the covert recordings needed to go, or charges might be filed. Why did they send me that signal, instead of just acting on their own? Was the intent to do me a favor, giving me a shot at resolving this quietly and helping my young administration without getting bogged down in the scandal of indictments just a few weeks after we got started? Maybe. Or perhaps they just understood the politics of all this before I did. Why should a U.S. attorney shoulder the responsibility of taking down a bellowed African-American police chief, if he can get the mayor to do it for him by removing him from his position? . . . I had lost confidence in the leadership of a chief who had not come to me the moment he realized he was the target of an FBI investigation.

Buttigieg repeated his claim as recently as April of this year, when The New York Times reported that the mayor-turned-presidential-candidate said, “It was made very clear to me by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney that either we would take employment action or there would be indictments.”

Boykins Attorney Claims Buttigieg Is Lying

But while the mayor publicly placed blame at the U.S. attorney’s office, Boykins’ attorney, Tom Dixon, claims that federal prosecutors were privately assuring him that no such conversation had occurred. Dixon told The Federalist that after the mayor first claimed he had demoted the police chief at the request of the U.S. attorney’s office, in exchange for the federal prosecutors dropping the investigation, one assistant U.S. attorney (AUSA) reached out to him “assuring me their office would never make a charging decision based on a quid pro quo employment decision by a municipality.”

Then, after the mayor floated the second justification—that he demoted Boykins because the police chief hadn’t informed Buttigieg that the chief was under investigation—Dixon said he then had a second meeting with multiple AUSAs. Dixon claims that, at that meeting, the AUSAs unequivocally stated that their office did not suggest, in any way, that the mayor should remove Boykins or the police chief might be charged with federal wiretap crimes.

“Nor was Boykins a target or subject of a federal investigation, as Buttigieg claimed,” Dixon told The Federalist. Rather, Dixon said that “In the second meeting, the ASUAs confirmed that Boykins was neither a subject nor a target of the investigation.”

It was then, according to Dixon, that the AUSAs gave him “a letter summarizing the results of the FBI’s investigation into the South Bend Police Department’s long-standing policy of taping telephone calls.” The federal prosecutors concluded that police department’s informal policy did not violate federal wiretapping laws, Dixon stated.

U.S. Attorneys Claim Dixon’s Story Wouldn’t Happen

Dixon had previously told The New York Times of his conversation with “an assistant prosecutor in the United States attorney’s office, a lawyer he knew from church, about the mayor’s assertion.” “Tom, that explanation is so contrary to the protocols of U.S. attorneys’ offices,” the Times reported Dixon recalling, “We never would condition a determination on prosecuting or not prosecuting based on an employment decision. It would never happen.”

The Federalist spoke with the three AUSAs Dixon indicated were involved with, or familiar with, this matter and they all refused to comment. They would neither confirm nor deny Buttigieg’s version of events or Dixon’s claims of his conversations with the AUSAs. The Public Affairs Office of the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Indiana likewise refused comment.

Buttigieg’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

This backstory explains the visceral response Buttigieg received when he reached out to the local black community on Sunday. The recent police shooting has elevated the significance of Buttigieg’s firing of Boykins and his explanation for that decision. But so long as the U.S. attorney’s office remains silent, the public faces a he-said, he-said dispute, and has no way of knowing whether Buttigieg or the former police chief’s attorney is speaking the truth.

With racial-tensions rising in this mid-sized community, the U.S. attorney’s office—which is now under new leadership—needs to answer the question: does Buttigieg have an integrity issue, or does the U.S. attorney’s office?

Let’s Reform The Way Hate Crimes Are Reported And Tracked,"On the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, USA Today published a report titled, “Anti-LGBT hate crimes are rising, the FBI says. But it gets worse,” arguing that current FBI hate crime statistics do not accurately represent the reality. FBI hate crime numbers indicate roughly 7,500 annual incidents, while the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) reports more than 200,000 annual hate crimes.

Commenting on the discrepancy, Robin Maril, associate legal director for the Human Rights Campaign argued, “If someone comes forward to report a hate crime, they could also be officially outing themselves as LGBTQ. In a smaller or rural community, that outing could result in an eviction or loss of a job.” Maril continued, “The level of discourse that we are getting from the Trump administration and leadership only hurts our community, only hurts trans people…It gives a sense of impunity and a license to harm folks.”

Arguing that the FBI statistics are flawed due to low reporting rates by law enforcement officials throughout the country, Maril said, “There are entire cities that don’t report any hate crimes. Cities like Miami might report zero hate crimes, but a hate crime does occur in Miami at least once a year.”

Roy L. Austin, a Justice Department official under the Obama administration, agreed: “The data is embarrassingly bad for a country that supposedly takes public safety so seriously. One would think that we would do a better job of collecting crime data. And none of our crime data is worse than our hate crime data.” There are about 18,000 police agencies in the country and, as of 2017, 16,149 were participating in the FBI hate crime reporting program—or nearly 90 percent.

Methods of Studying Hate Crimes

The Department of Justice administers two separate hate crime collection methods. The FBI runs the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the Bureau of Justice runs the NCVS. The UCR relies on police agency reporting and the NCVS relies on self-reporting surveys.

One major discrepancy is that, between 2003 and 2015, an annual average of 14,380 individuals reported to the NCVS that police had confirmed their attack was a hate crime, while during the same period the UCR only reported 8,370 incidents. To provide perspective, the NCVS estimates an annual average of 252,630 hate crimes with 41 percent reported to police (104,600), with 14 percent (14,380) stating they were confirmed by police.

The NCVS survey describes itself as a “self-report survey in which interviewed persons are asked about the number and characteristics of victimizations experienced during the prior 6 months.” Once a household is selected, the residents of the household remain in the survey for three years and are interviewed every six months, in person or over the phone, for a total of seven interviews.

The Interviewing Manual for the Census Bureau states that all areas of the United States, with a few exceptions, are eligible and that “the households to be interviewed for the NCVS are selected by scientific sampling methods from specific sampling areas across the United States.” In 2015, the most recent survey, 95,760 households and 163,880 individuals age 12 and older were interviewed.

The survey requires three types of evidence for a crime to be considered a hate crime. The victim must provide at least one type of evidence. The offender must have used hate language, left behind a hate symbol, or police investigators must have confirmed the incident was a hate crime. There appears to be no further validation beyond the self-reporting of the individual.

Between 2011 and 2015, 98.7 percent of victims provided “hate language” as evidence of the crime, with 90 percent reporting the incident involved violence or sexual assault. Although not included in the official statistics, the report states that 83 percent provided additional evidence defined as “their feelings, instincts, or perception lead them to suspect this incident was a hate crime or crime of prejudice or bigotry, even though there was not enough evidence to know for sure.”

Characteristics of Victims

Reasons given for not reporting to the police (53 percent of incidents) included 41 percent stating the issue was resolved by another authority such as a school official and one in five simply stated they did not feel their victimization was important enough to report. The most commonly cited reason typically offered in most media reports is that the victim was afraid of the police or felt they would not take them seriously, which accounted for 23 percent in this survey.

Despite Maril’s concern that people in rural areas would be more afraid to report, the survey found only 6.9 percent were from rural areas. The majority of incidents were said to have occurred in urban and suburban areas, primarily in the western U.S. (45.8 percent), with the South representing 18 percent of incidents.

Characteristics provided by victims indicated that the vast majority of offenders were single males, white or black, over the age of 30 and 44 percent of them knew their attacker. The self-described victims are majority white males between the ages of 35 and 64 with either incomes below the poverty line or in the middle-class range.

The focus on LGBT hate crimes in the USA Today article represented 22 percent of of the total victims surveyed which was slightly less than those who reported being attacked for their association with a minority individual. This would indicate an annual average of 44,000 LGBT hate crime victims in comparison to the current 2017 FBI statistic of less than 1,200.

Austin illustrated why these discrepancies matter: “The single most important thing is to link any federal funding on crime prevention on providing accurate and regular numbers.”

What Can We Do About Hate Crime Reporting?

The survey brings up important issues on the way we handle hate crimes and the expected legal and social goal. It is troubling that the Department of Justice relies so heavily on self-reporting, with no independent verification for such important data collection. The overwhelming majority of those claiming to be victims provided only their personal perception of their attacker’s motivations.

The reliance on how the victim felt over what actual evidence is available should not be determining federal resources or law. Case in point, the nearly doubling of “confirmed by police to be a hate crime” in the NCVS report reflects the victim merely saying so to the interviewing agent. In contrast, the UCR cases are vetted and transmitted by police agencies directly to the FBI. It is telling that public criticism is on the flawed reporting by the police.

Another concern is in the definition of “hate crime.” Considering that nearly 20 percent of those interviewed were minors and only needed to report “hate language” being used, it seems this information is poorly substantiated. Hate crime laws are supposed to deter those who would choose to target and violently attack a person over his or her real or perceived sexuality, religion, ethnicity or other immutable characteristics. It was not intended to punish the use of mean words or the perception of malicious intention in an altercation.

Moreover, media shouting that 200,000 people each year are victims of violent hate crimes that the police won’t report to the FBI is reckless and irresponsible. It perpetuates fear and validates petty grievances.

What this survey tells us is that our political leaders need to re-evaluate state and federal hate crime guidelines, requiring a timely report to the police to be considered in legal proceedings. The Hate Crime Statistics Act must be clarified to collect and report only on confirmed incidents of hate crimes rather than socially governed abstract and subjective standards designed to validate the accuser’s feelings rather than scientifically reporting on the confirmed evidence.

Government agencies should be held to a higher standard of reporting on these numbers, as the media simply repeats the major talking points, but rarely investigates the details, leading to wildly misleading headlines and public perception. As illustrated by transgender activist Naomi Green, referring to media reports on anti-LGBT violence, “It’s very traumatizing. … You’re constantly feeling on edge and looking over your shoulder.”

LGBT people are being taught to be afraid, report to interviewers that we are afraid, and then see headlines reporting that a majority of us are afraid. The cycle must end.

"Revisiting ‘Batman, The Animated Series’: ‘Feat Of Clay’ (Parts 1 And 2)","Spoilers ahead.

“Feat Of Clay” marks the first appearance of Clayface, in a quality two-parter. Oddly befitting of a shape-shifter, Clayface has had at least nine iterations in the comics (and another in the 1970s Batman cartoon), both male and female. The first Clayface, an actor named Basil Karlo as an homage to Boris Karloff (the classic Frankenstein monster and the original Mummy), was not even a shape-shifter in his first appearance.

This Clayface is also an actor, but with the name and powers of the second Clayface, Matt Hagen. Yet the origin is new, in a story co-written by Marv Wolfman, a comics veteran perhaps best known for co-creating the vampire hunter Blade for Marvel.

As a reboot of a second-tier villain, this episode is not quite as successful as the reinvention of Mr. Freeze. The problem is motivation. Mr. Freeze was given an origin in which he is trying to avenge his late wife. Hagen’s tragedy is a car crash that leaves him disfigured and desperate to recover his leading man appearance.

The episode’s title is a play on the prophet Daniel’s interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, referring to a fatal character flaw. Hagen’s flaw is vanity, which may be relatable to many, but less dramatic than love. It is more tragic that the cure leads Hagen into addiction, but this angle is not emphasized as it was in “It’s Never Too Late.” Consequently, Clayface comes across as less sympathetic than Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, or even Lloyd Ventrix. Nevertheless, the plot contains enough turns to hold viewers’ full attention.

In Part 1, Lucius Fox arrives at an abandoned warehouse, bringing Bruce Wayne evidence Roland Daggett is trying to take over Wayne Enterprises by insider trading. But Fox has been ambushed by Daggett’s henchmen, with Hagen masquerading as Bruce. Gunfire attracts Batman and the police; Batman chases the scattering henchmen and fails to notice his doppelganger. A wounded Fox identifies Bruce as his attacker to the police.

The next day, at the Imperial Pictures movie lot, stand-in Teddy Lupus finds action star Hagen trashing his trailer. Hagen, whose face is disfigured, desperately searches for the Daggett-manufactured “Renuyu” skin cream that maintains his looks. Teddy, knowing Hagen is doing Daggett’s bidding after becoming addicted to Renuyu, kept one last bit in reserve. After using the cream, Hagen can push his features back into place, but only for 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Daggett orders his top two henchmen – Raymond Bell and the mysophobic “Germs” – to kill Hagen after the failed murder attempt. The henchmen think a master of disguise will be tough to find; Daggett predicts Hagen will come to them.

Sure enough, Hagen, posing as Bruce, breaks into Daggett’s lab to get his fix of Renuyu and is ambushed by Bell and Germs. They beat Hagen and pour a vat of Renuyu down his throat before dumping him in his car and leaving him for dead.

Bruce learns he is wanted for police questioning in the Fox case. The caped crusader uses his computer to identify Bell from the warehouse. Police files indicate Bell habitually monitors police frequencies with headphones. Batman creates a fake police bulletin about Bell, who tries to flee Gotham by automobile.

In a ridiculous set piece, Batman flies his Batwing into Gotham Tunnel, impaling Bell’s car on the front. Batman then extracts Bell with a mechanical arm and dangles him over the river to discover who is framing Bruce. Bell faints before providing a name; Batman is forced to drop Bell in a rooftop swimming pool when police helicopters intercept the Batwing.

Trying to clear his name, Bruce later sneaks into Fox’s hospital room, but Fox presses the alarm button. Police burst into the room and arrest Bruce. Meanwhile, Teddy discovers Hagen’s car. Teddy puts his hand on Hagen’s shoulder, which has a mushy consistency. Hagen looks into his rear-view mirror, screaming when he discovers he has been transformed into a hulking, golem-esque monster.

Part 2 begins with a montage of Bruce being released on bail. (In reality, a millionaire with global resources would be considered a flight risk.)

Clayface and Teddy hide in Hagen’s trailer. Clayface recalls the automobile crash that left him disfigured, and how he grasped at the cure Daggett offered him in the hospital. As Hagen gazes at his movie posters, he finds himself reflexively transforming into his old roles. The effect is temporary, like tensing a muscle. He cannot save his career.

Batman and Clayface both realize there will be another attempt on Fox’s life at the hospital, which can lead them to their target. Batman catches Germs trying to smother Fox with a pillow and chases him into a room housing bacteria and viruses. Pretending a vial of water contains crimson fever, Batman scares Germs into naming Hagen as Fox’s assailant.

The two are interrupted by Clayface, disguised as a policeman. Clayface strikes at Batman with an elongated arm and seizes Germs. Batman stops Clayface from throwing Germs off the hospital roof during a fight in which Clayface turns his arms into a variety of weapons, including hammers, a fork, and giant lobster claws. Clayface leaps from the roof; he splatters on the ground and slithers through a sewer grate.

During a live talk show, Summer Gleeson interviews Daggett about Renuyu, a so-called “face lift in a jar.” A large woman in the audience begins questioning Daggett about rumors of Renuyu’s side effects, including addiction. Daggett, visibly sweating, denies the accusations; the woman steps onstage and reveals herself as Clayface, panicking the crowd.

Batman has infiltrated the television control room, inserting cassettes into videotape machines. When Hagen reveals himself onstage, Batman stops Daggett’s escape with a Batarang before taking the fight to Clayface.

Batman is overmatched, but lures Clayface into the control room. Batman uses the videotape machines to play movie clips of Hagen, in hope of convincing Hagen he can be rehabilitated. Instead, the videos cause Clayface to spasmodically transform into his past roles (not unlike the death throes of the T-1000 in “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991)). The police enter the control room in time to see Clayface transform into Bruce Wayne, effectively clearing Bruce in the Fox case.

Clayface attacks the video equipment, seemingly electrocuting himself. As Hagen, Clayface tells Batman he regrets he will not see the reviews of his dramatic death scene.

Later, Batman realizes Clayface’s death was in fact a scene; an empty clay shell crumbles on examination in the morgue. Teddy is seen mourning while a nearby woman with sickly yellow eyes laughs to herself.

Despite the weakness of Clayface’s motivation, “Feat Of Clay” has more strengths. Ron Perlman (Hellboy) maximizes his character as Clayface even when the script does not. Ed Asner and Brock Peters also make the most of their roles as Roland Daggett and Lucius Fox (characters who would become more familiar in Christopher Nolan’s film trilogy). Surprisingly, the teleplay even gives character to Daggett’s obligatory henchmen, although Ed Begley Jr. overdoes it as Germs.

Although the animation in Part 1 is another clunky effort from Akon, Part 2, animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha Co., has top-tier animation. The lighting inside Dagget’s factory and in the climactic battle are as dramatic as Clayface’s shape-shifting effects. Both parts are elevated by Shirley Walker’s score, particularly her theme for Clayface.

Police Officer Who Killed Eric Garner Suspended,"Daniel Pantaleo was suspended from the New York Police Department Friday after a national outcry calling for the officer’s firing over the killing of an unarmed black man.

A New York administrative judge recommended his termination after Pantaleo put 43-year-old Eric Garner in a chokehold that killed him.

“Officer Pantaleo has been suspended, effective today, as is the longstanding practice in these matters when the recommendation is termination,” the New York Police Department said in a statement. “All of New York City understandably seeks closure to this difficult chapter in our City’s history. … In order to protect the integrity of the trial proceedings and conclusion, the NYPD will not comment further until the Police Commissioner makes the final determination.”

Garner’s death, caught on video five years ago, sparked national protests, and his last words led to the “I can’t breathe” mantra of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The decision of whether Pantaleo will officially be let go from the force now proceeds to the city’s police commissioner, James O’Neill.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is currently running for the Democratic presidential nomination, praised the decision to suspend Pantaleo.

“Today, we finally saw a step towards justice and accountability,” de Blasio said in a press conference following the announcement. “We saw a process that was actually fair and impartial, and I hope that this will now bring the Garner family a sense of closure and the beginning of some peace.”

In a statement, the president of the New York City Police Benevolent Association, Patrick Lynch, condemned the judge’s call for Pantaleo to be terminated as “pure political insanity.”

“If it is allowed to stand, it will paralyze the NYPD for years to come,” Lynch said. “The only hope for justice now lies with Police Commissioner O’Neill. He knows the message that this decision sends to every cop: we are expendable, and we cannot expect any support from the city we protect.”

The U.S. Department of Justice announced weeks ago that it would not seek civil rights or criminal charges against Pantaleo after the five-year investigation.

During the second night of the Democratic presidential debates this week, which featured de Blasio on stage, hecklers interrupted the prime-time event multiple times throughout the evening, chanting, “Fire Pantaleo.” The topic became a subject of discussion later in the evening, with multiple candidates, including New York Sen.

7 Reasons More People Should Concealed Carry,"America is dangerous. The world is dangerous. Here, there, and everywhere, danger is lurking. When people act unpredictably and threateningly, the best thing to do is be prepared.

Police and security are the ideal intermediaries, but personal safety cannot be entirely entrusted to others. It is time to responsibly conceal a firearm.

There are innumerable benefits to obtaining a license to carry a firearm. Here are the top seven reasons that more people should get licensed, train with their gun, and concealed carry daily.

1. Carrying Makes You More Observant

When carrying a firearm, you have the ultimate power of force in your control. With this great power is an equally great duty to stay aware.

When carrying, you need to be observant so you do not get attacked or lose control of your firearm. You must be alert to potential threats in case you need to use your weapon. And you must be cognizant of how you act so your weapon remains concealed and does not create a problem or threat for others.

There many reasons to be vigilant when carrying, and all of them make for a more responsible citizen. When carrying, you may notice odd behavior in others or things that seem out of place. This may be a public threat, like a person wearing a large jacket in the summertime or acting suspiciously, or it may be someone simply in need of help whom you noticed because you were paying attention.

At the grocery store, pumping gas, or just walking around the neighborhood, lawfully carrying a weapon guarantees more observant and alert engagement with your surroundings.

2. Concealed Carrying Makes You More Careful

Along with being attentive to others’ behavior and activities around you, carrying a weapon ensures that you act as a better citizen. While lawfully carrying means that police will not find fault for having a weapon, it is still important to avoid the dangerous potential for a confrontation with police while armed. After all, any interaction with police could result in miscommunication or accident.

This means that concealed carriers adhere more carefully to speed limits and local laws and conform more diligently to rules and regulations in daily life. Statistically, licensed concealed carriers are more law abiding than their unarmed peers. This is not only because of more careful behavior, but more diligent knowledge of state and local laws.

Carrying also causes people to act more deliberately, not rushing or acting carelessly. When concealing in many jurisdictions, it is unlawful to reveal the weapon unless brandishing it in self-defense or temporarily engaging with a peace officer. With this more deliberate pace and action, individuals are more likely to avoid conflict and better able to observe their surroundings.

3. You Can Protect Yourself from Victimization

Defensive uses of firearms routinely outweigh unlawful and violent uses. What’s more, defensive uses of firearms need not result in harm or death. Merely brandishing a gun or telling the would-be assailants about a gun many prevent victimization.

This extends to all types of crime, from home invasions to muggings, rape and assault, to stalking and attempted murder. Carrying a firearm affords you the option to thwart victimization and stay safe.

Police response time, even in the best of conditions, is usually a matter of minutes. When a criminal is approaching, most people only have seconds to react. It is better to have a gun and prevent injustice than to wait for police and potentially become a victim, even if justice is ultimately served on the criminal.

4. You Can Protect Others from Threats and Violence

A gun to protect yourself is important, but a responsible citizen can protect her fellow man as well. Deadly force is not allowed to defend property or nonlethal harm, but it is allowed to protect yourself and others from deadly threats.

This means a lawfully carrying citizen can stop the victimization of another and save lives. Again, this does not necessitate killing the criminal, but the option exists if intervening and brandishing the firearm is not sufficient to save the innocent party.

Then there are mass shooting events, in which an individual carrying a weapon is able to save not only himself and a neighbor, but potentially hundreds of fellow citizens. While under-reported, there are many documented cases of such heroic interventions.

5. You Carry Your Own Background Check with You

A concealed carry permit is its own proof of character. To obtain a license in most states, fingerprinting and background checks are required. These are routinely updated, so any unlawful conduct is flagged and the license can be rescinded. So every day, the license represents a fresh and up-to-date background check.

This is useful for a number of reasons, including interacting with law enforcement and purchasing new weapons. When engaging with law enforcement, such as during a traffic stop, providing a license to carry a firearm communicates to that officer that you are a responsible, law-abiding citizen.

When purchasing guns from a federally licensed firearms dealer, every person must undergo a federal background check. Providing a concealed-carry license or permit can expedite this process and might even make the seller trust and respect you more.

6. You Are Empowered

Knowing you can defend yourself and your neighbors is incredibly empowering. Carrying a weapon and knowing how to use it safely gives you the confidence to face every day without fear of being a victim.

Best of all, you do not have to rely on others for your own protection. Police response time is not fast enough to prevent immediate danger, and a gun equalizes threats, whether you are five feet tall or a heavyweight wrestler, man or woman, old or young, disabled, outnumbered, or otherwise.

7. You Are Comfortable Around Weapons

Most fears are rooted in the unknown. Many people who hate guns have never shot one or are not comfortable around them. A good way to be more comfortable around guns is to know how they work and how to properly handle them.

Responsible, law-abiding citizens who carry must be able to proficiently carry, discharge, disassemble, clean, and reassemble their firearm. They know what to do, and more importantly, what not to do with firearms in order to be safe around them.

You never know when you may encounter a gun. It is best to be prepared in case you ever do. This might be as simple as handling your own guns or a gun at a store or friend’s house. But it also extends to those unknown and rare instances when faced with a threatening gun—maybe an abandoned gun in a park or when a threatening criminal brandishes a gun. If the bad guy is incapacitated, disarmed, or otherwise loses his grip, a responsible gun owner is the best person to take control of that weapon before the criminal gets it back or a child or other bystander unsafely takes the weapon.

Knowing how to control a weapon and store and operate it safely is essential to being a responsible gun owner. And experience with guns is the best way to improve those skills. Carrying not only improves your safety, awareness, and confidence, but it makes you an even more responsible gun owner.

The last thing America needs is vigilante justice or reckless gun owners. But responsible, law-abiding concealed carry is one way to be a better citizen and protect yourself and your community. Even if you never bring out your weapon, it improves the way you engage with the world and causes you to be a more responsible, deliberate, and careful citizen.

"I’m A Professor, And I Carry A Gun On Campus. Here’s Why","I am an ethics professor, and I carry a concealed handgun in the classroom. In the event of a mass shooting, I am the first line of defense between my students and an attacker. I refuse to let myself and my students be victims.

I’m sure many of my fellow professors would disagree with my actions. In fact, many would probably brand me as a traitor to academia for admitting such a thing. For them, it is inconceivable that a member of the intelligentsia — an ethics professor, of all people — could support the right to carry a so-called instrument of death.

So in what follows, let me make the moral case for campus carry. Those wanting a more rigorous statement of my argument may be interested in reading one of my academic journal articles on the topic.

The Moral Case for Campus Carry

Campus carry is simply an extension of our natural right of self-defense. Our right to life follows us wherever we go, so the right to defend our lives must also accompany us. Whether I am at home, in my car, at work, or in the classroom, I possess the absolute and unrelenting right to defend myself against unjust aggression. Because firearms enhance that right, there exists a strong presumption in favor of being allowed to own and carry a firearm as I go about my daily business.

That presumption may sometimes be overcome (such as in courthouses, prisons, or airports), but only if the government assumes the special responsibility of protecting those citizens whom it disarms through the coercive power of the law. In other words, if the government is going to tell us we can’t carry guns in a specific area, thus impairing our ability to defend ourselves, it must assume a special responsibility to protect us. It must serve the function our guns would provide had we been allowed to carry them.

An analogy might help illustrate this point. Suppose I push you into deep water as part of a swimming lesson. Because I have intentionally put you into a position of increased vulnerability, I owe it to you to make sure you do not drown. Likewise, if the government requires us to disarm ourselves before entering a specific area, it knowingly puts us in a position of increased vulnerability. It must therefore assume the special responsibility of making up for the gap it has created by increasing protective measures.

The government meets this special responsibility only if it can provide a means of defense equivalent to the one it has coercively stripped away. In the real world, this means it must maintain a pervasive armed presence in the places in which it has disarmed us.

The presence of an ordinary police force does not meet this requirement. Police responses almost always come after someone has already committed a crime. According to data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, only 47.3 percent of all personal crimes in 2008 were even reported to police. Of these crimes, only 28 percent of police responses came within five minutes of reporting, 30.3 percent within six to 10 minutes, and 33.5 percent within 11 minutes to one hour of reporting.

Clearly, for resisting attack, the police cannot play the same role as people can by carrying their own guns. The only government apparatus capable of effectively intervening in the midst of a crime is one in which police or other law enforcement officials are present everywhere, which is neither attainable nor desirable.

An ever-vigilant law enforcement presence obviously isn’t feasible in the vast majority of “gun-free” zones, especially college campuses. Even though many colleges and universities maintain their own dedicated police departments, they lack the manpower to maintain a pervasive armed presence. Given the scarcity of police protection in relation to the large areas these officers must protect, the government cannot adequately meet its special duty of protection on campuses. As such, qualified students, staff, and faculty should be allowed to carry guns on campuses.

It is absurd to think one forfeits the right to defend his life simply by entering a classroom. The right of self-defense is essential to our very dignity as human beings. Although we may sometimes partially delegate this responsibility to others, we can never delegate it completely. Even in the most secure college campus, the police response to an active shooter is measured in minutes. But when seconds matter, it is up to students and faculty to defend their own lives. And they cannot do this without a reasonable and effective means of self-defense.

The empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that forcefully resisting violent crime with a gun is associated with lower injury rates and successful resistance. Studies consistently find that defensive gun use is beneficial for both men and women.

Guns also have deterrent effects aside from their use in disrupting crimes in progress. Criminals tend to pick “soft” targets, so the mere possibility of forceful resistance from victims serves as a disincentive that may prevent shootings before they even begin. Why not extend these benefits to primary and secondary school teachers, college students, and college faculty?

Bad Arguments Against Campus Carry

Some argue campus carry creates a difficult situation for responding police officers, who will be unable to determine the good guys from the bad guys. But this objection proves too much: It applies to any situation in which the police encounter a victim who is successfully resisting an attack. If the mere possibility of mistaken identity is enough to justify a ban on campus carry, it would also justify a ban on any kind of forceful self-defense measure.

Simply because the police may have difficulty distinguishing between criminals and victims does not mean victims forfeit their right to forceful self-defense. Our right to self-defense is not a function of the ability of the police to protect us, but a basic dignity grounded in our right to life.

Many opponents of campus carry argue college-aged students are prone to excessive alcohol consumption and other reckless behavior that would make carrying more dangerous. While this may be true when considering college students in general, this does not take into account the fact that concealed carry permit holders tend to be more law-abiding than non-permit holders across all age groups. The common stereotype of college students as reckless party animals does not apply to the subset of students who are licensed to carry weapons.

Another objection is that civilians don’t have enough training to defend themselves and others while under pressure. This objection is simply false. First, one does not need to be an expert with firearms to use them successfully. As I’ve pointed out, studies consistently show that individuals do just fine when defending themselves with firearms, despite their relative lack of training compared to police officers. Even for the untrained, guns are still their best bet.

Second, just as some defense is better than no defense, having a weapon is better than having no weapon at all. If I find myself in a situation in which I must defend myself or others against a gunman, I would much rather trust my life to my gun than to my ability to tackle the shooter. Studies show armed resistance is more effective than unarmed resistance, so if I’m going to defend myself with a weapon, I’d prefer it be the kind of weapon that best guarantees a successful outcome. In that respect, nothing compares to a gun.

The final objection I wish to consider is that guns don’t belong in classrooms because they have a “chilling effect” on the free exchange of ideas. As a professor who lectures on controversial topics all the time, I regard this as pure nonsense. Self-protection is the guardian of free expression, not its enemy.

A world in which we are the most free to express our ideas is one in which we are entitled to protect ourselves from persecution for holding the ideas we have. This isn’t to say we all must carry guns on us at all times, but that self-protection complements free speech. Besides, this objection also proves too much: If allowing access to a means of self-defense is inherently at odds with free expression, this argument would apply to all kinds of self-defense, not just guns.

Earlier, I pointed out that those who carry concealed weapons tend to be extremely law-abiding. If this is true, there is no good reason to fear those who are armed for self-protection. Such fears are unfounded and promote a mistaken perception of gun carriers. Indeed, the exact opposite may very well be true: In the same way that a police presence might lead to a greater perception of safety, many people may feel safer knowing that qualified students and faculty are carrying weapons for self-defense.

Addition: Since publishing this article I have received numerous questions about the legality of what I do. I fully comply with all applicable laws and recommend the same to others.

New York City Fires Police Officer Who Killed Eric Garner,"Daniel Pantaleo was fired from the New York City Police Department Monday following a New York administrative judge’s recommendation of that decision due to his involvement in the death of Eric Garner.

“In this case the unintended consequence of Mr. Garner’s death must have a consequence of its own. Therefore I agree with the deputy commissioner of trial’s legal findings and recommendations,” New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neil said during a press conference. “It is clear that Daniel Pantaleo can no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer.”

Pantaleo was suspended from the force earlier this month following a national outcry calling for the officer’s termination over the use of an illegal chokehold that was maintained until Garner, 43, passed away. Garner, a black man, was unarmed during the altercation.

Garner’s death, which was captured on video five years ago, sparked national protests that led to the “I can’t breathe” mantra of the Black Lives Matter movement, inspired by Garner’s last words.

The New York City Police Benevolent Association, the nation’s largest municipal police union representing more than 50,000 members, condemned O’Neill’s decision to fire Pantaleo Monday afternoon.

“The damage is already done. The NYPD will remain rudderless and frozen, and Commissioner O’Neill will never be able to bring it back. Now it is time for every police officer in this city to make their own choice,” the organization’s President Patrick Lynch said in a statement.

O’Neill’s decision to relieve Pantaleo of his duties complies with the administrative judge’s recommendation following a weeks-long hearing after the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would not seek civil rights or criminal charges against Pantaleo after a five-year investigation.

Garner’s death has been a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, provoking several Democratic presidential candidates to weigh in. At the last set of Democratic primary debates held in Detroit last month, featuring the New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on stage and one of the state’s U.S. senators, hecklers demanded Pantaleo’s firing.

The case was eventually discussed during the primetime event. The several candidates who weighed in on the case, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, called for Pantaleo to be let go. De Blasio praised Pantaleo’s suspension from the department earlier this month.

“We saw a process that was actually fair and impartial, and I hope that this will now bring the Garner family a sense of closure and the beginning of some peace,” de Blasio said in a press conference.

Boston Judges Should Throw The Book At Cop-Assaulting Antifa,"There was some good news for Boston police and all Americans in a Boston courtroom where Judge Thomas Horgan told three protestors charged with assaulting police during an Antifa protest of the Straight Pride Parade in the city on Saturday to “Stay out of Boston” while they await their next court appearance in November.

In another courtroom, Judge Richard Sinnott denied requests from prosecutors — yes, you read that right, prosecutors — to dismiss charges against seven others arrested on lesser charges.

All of this came one day after the head of the Boston police union urged prosecutors and the city to take seriously the incidents this weekend in which 36 counter protesters were arrested. “We’re very happy with the judge’s decision,” said Larry Calderone, a representative of the Boston Police Patrolmen Association.

The judges’ actions were wholly appropriate but out of step with the lax way Boston city officials seemed to address Saturday’s events, and with the city of Portland, Oregon’s repeated failures to keep dangerous Antifa protestors in check. But it turns out Boston ain’t Portland.

One thing should be made clear: the Straight Pride Parade, which attracted a whopping 200 attendees, compared to more than 600 protestors, is a stupid event meant only to provoke angry opposition. Its grand marshal, Milo Yiannopoulos, is a consummate grifter who makes his money and reputation stoking anger in young men by convincing them they are being oppressed.

The 200 lost souls marching through Boston on some kind of supposed “straight pride” agenda, while following the flamboyantly gay Milo, are a pathetic bunch that should be ignored. Pointing at rare examples of anti-straight rhetoric, like a recent NBC news story arguing that heterosexuality may be obsolete, they decry their supposed oppression, but they really are trolls looking for attention that the counter protesters, including Antifa, foolishly gave them.

But hey, if people want to spend their actual lives in the equivalent of a daylong argument with anonymous Twitter trolls, it’s their dime. What crosses the line is violent or criminal activity. What crosses it further is violent activity directed at police.

Antifa, the darlings of many useful idiots on the left, often target police with their rhetoric, angrily and baselessly accusing officers of defending fascists instead of fighting against them. But they have friends in high places. Both Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ayanna Pressley had nothing but praise for these thugs accused of assaulting police, even urging followers to donate to their legal funds.

The disgraceful pass that too many on the left give to Antifa in this situation is wrong for many reasons, but two stand out. First of all, Antifa are not modern-day stormers of the beaches at Normandy, trying to stamp out some growing trend of fascism in the United States. They are in fact, generally privileged, entitled, totalitarian anarchists (yes, that’s a thing) who want to shut down the speech of anyone they disagree with. They accept and espouse violence as an appropriate method for their activism. They are criminals and thugs.

But the more important reason in this case is that the target of their violence was police officers. There aren’t a lot of jobs in civilian American life in which people literally have to put their lives on the line and wonder if they will be going home after their shift. Being a cop is one of them. Our duty as a society, the duty of our government, is to protect them to the best of our ability.

That prosecutors would seek dismissal of charges against those accused of being involved in the mischief of putting police at risk, and that congresswomen would applaud them, is extremely disturbing. The men and women of our nation’s police forces, who represent every possible demographic group our wonderfully diverse society has, deserve better. They deserve respect.

The judges in Boston did the right thing. Hopefully this will become a growing trend and Antifa will learn that their violent antics won’t simply be put up with because of a wrongheaded and simplistic notion that they are on the right side of history.

It is happily ironic that Horgan told them to stay out of Boston, as one of Antifa’s common rallying cries is that those they protest against aren’t welcome in the cities they claim to be defending. Not this time, Antifa. Boston cops and Boston judges are right to demand you have your day in court. Let’s hope more cities do the same.

Why Criminals Looking To Victimize Women Love Gun Control,"On September 3, Lachelle Hudgins wounded a robber who had attempted to steal her purse. While the mainstream media pan the attack as an overreaction to an attempted purse-snatching, Hudgins, who was there, saw it differently.

According to the video recorded by a local ABC reporter, five attackers approached her car in the wee hours of the morning. How was she to know the attack would end with only a stolen purse? “With so many men surrounding her car and trying to get in the car, she did the only thing she could think to do. She reached in her purse for her gun.” Hudgins said of the incident, “I saved my life.”

In all the current hysteria to “buy back” (translation: “confiscate”) guns, we should not overlook this question: Should women be permitted to protect their own bodies? Or should they be forced to passively endure an attack until an authorized protector from the government can ride to their rescue?

I can reasonably assume Ronnie Preyer’s opinion: He’s against women being armed. Or he would be if this serial rapist wasn’t shot to death by a Cape Girardeau woman fighting to protect her body from his attack. After Preyer raped her the first time, she dutifully called the police. A few days later, he returned to attack her a second time. This time, instead of a phone, she used a gun to protect herself.

Ricky Wright would likely join calls for sensible gun control after being shot in the face by Michelle Booker when he attempted to steal her car and drive off with her children inside. Justin Martin, were he alive, would also likely join the chorus for gun control, after being shot trying to invade the home of an 18-year-old woman with her new baby. Go mama bear! A 70-year-old grandmother in Philadelphia created yet another gun-control advocate when she wounded a 43-year-old home invader trying to, well, thank heavens we don’t know what.

Often overlooked in the gun control issue is that laws intended to disarm male attackers also reduce the choices women have for self-protection. It might make sense for some gun control advocates to carry pepper spray or remain in the company of a protective male. But for some women who wish to live independently, the option of a firearm offsets the overwhelming physical superiority of a potential attacker. It’s her body. Shouldn’t she have the right to choose how best to protect it?

“No!” says the National Women’s Law Center. The solution may be found in “robust public policies” to keep guns out of the hands of people who have demonstrated their capacity to harm others.” Yet Preyer’s victim did exactly that, reporting his violent rape of her days before he returned to do it again. Unfortunately, “robust public policies” keep guns out of the hands of victims, leaving them to attempt fending off attackers with nothing but a cell phone and soaring social justice rhetoric.

Ah, but what about “common sense” gun restrictions? Consider Vermont’s well-intentioned laws that will actually make women more defenseless in the face of their attackers. Among other things, it bans women under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm to keep in their purses. That should make good common sense to predators who prefer victims under the age of 21.

California, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Hawaii, parts of Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York have all restricted the magazines women can use in their handguns to 10 or fewer rounds. Why would anyone need more than 10 rounds to defend themselves? Because, as a study shows, when a trained police officer fires at a suspect at close range, he has a 15 percent chance of hitting his target.

This is the reason police have gradually trended away from the big Dirty Harry-style guns with high-powered rounds in favor of the high-capacity but lighter 9mm weapons. Why? To be effective, the weapon needs to hit its target. In the heat of the moment, the police prefer to have a margin of error.

So if a police officer needs to stop a bad guy with lethal force, how many shots does he need to expend before he has a reasonable chance of actually hitting a single assailant? A 9mm Glock used by a large number of police departments carries up to 19 rounds. If police officers were sent into service with only 10 rounds in their handguns, they would only have 10 chances at 15 percent to even hit an assailant.

Reload? Not at six feet away, a distance at which most of these conflicts take place. Remember the scene in “Pulp Fiction” in which two mob hitmen forget to check a back room for a potential threat. A panicky assailant pops out and empties a giant .44 revolver in their direction. Stunned, they realize that every single round missed both of them in spite of the shooter being within ten feet. One hitman credits divine intervention. The other chalks it up to a crazy fluke.

Yet this scene would not have required divine intervention. If a trained police officer has a 15 percent chance of hitting a person at six feet, it’s very plausible that a less-experienced civilian could miss six consecutive shots at that same range. Remember Hudgins? She had only two rounds in her firearm to fend off five attackers. Had the attackers been even slightly more persistent, she would have needed a full clip of at least 11 rounds to have a fighting chance to escape.

Consider another point. There have been several instances in American history in which a community has descended into anarchy. Sometimes it’s the result of a disaster such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Other times, a vengeful mob takes to the street to spread destruction. Think the Los Angeles riots after Rodney King’s attackers were acquitted.

Remember the images of the Korean store owners protecting their shops with guns? If that were to happen in your city, how many rounds would you need in your magazine to credibly deter a mob from laying waste to your property or visiting bodily harm on you or your loved ones?

Finally, how many rounds would your wife, mother, or sister need if she were home with the baby when two attackers broke through the front door? In my humble opinion, the answer to that question, whether it’s 12 rounds or 19, defines the constitutional right. You know, the right about arming bears—mama bears.

What Happened When I Ran For My Life During A Shooter Call To Police,"You know something’s terribly wrong when you go to a horror movie at the theater, and the terror of your real-life experience infinitely surpasses any of the imagery onscreen. Such was my Saturday night at a theater outside Washington, D.C.

It was with much anticipation that a group of my closest friends and I went to the theater that evening. We had been eagerly awaiting the release of “IT Chapter 2” since the remake of the first chapter of the Stephen King classic was released two years ago. We were so excited, in fact, that my roommate and I decided to host an IT-themed party at our place afterward to muse over the best scenes, characters, and jump-scares. That isn’t what we ended up reliving, however.

Since it was a three-hour movie, we attended an early showing so we would have enough time for our party afterward. We began our indulgence into the surfeit of infernal clown spooks at 5:30, and we filed out of our seats during the closing credits at 8:38. That’s the time the police received the first call about an active shooter inside the theater.

It seemed odd that the entrance to the auditorium directly across the hallway from ours, which had begun a later showing of the same movie, was swarming with people. “That’s weird,” I said as we walked past them down the hallway to find a restroom — a necessity after 169 minutes of film and 32 ounces of Icee.

I left the restroom to reconnect with the rest of my group and found them talking with a young couple in the midst of some mild commotion. The lady was on the verge of tears as she told us somebody had yelled “active shooter” during their movie. It was probably just a prank, I thought, trying to keep my wits.

I had no sooner calmed myself when a police officer walked past us with his gun drawn, his finger over the trigger. Tightness filled my chest. I don’t remember who told me to move, but I walked with purpose, in tandem with my friends, toward the stairs leading to the lobby and exit.

As we crested the staircase, I couldn’t believe my eyes at the number of police officers moving in our direction. They walked in a line that spanned the length of the vast theater entrance, like soldiers in rank, carrying high-powered weapons. We walked quickly toward them, and motion caught my eye across the lobby as moviegoers spilled en masse out of the other exit.

“Get out! Get out! GET OUT!” the officer nearest us shouted, suddenly.

All semblance of calm evaporated. Panic broke out. I took off running and watched as a lady across the room slipped on the laminate floor and fell face-first, her body pounding into the corner of a square support beam. One of my friends caught a baby stroller as it toppled into him. People began tossing items aside that were slowing them down, everything from drinks to wallets.

It’s a strange sort of terror to be suddenly thrust into the center of your worst nightmare with no idea how it will end. This sort of bad dream doesn’t dissipate when you open your eyes. You have no choice but to act, to move, to think quickly without being overcome with fear and emotion.

This movie theater didn’t open to the the outside. It opened into a shopping mall, and a poorly designed one at that. After the last movie I had seen at this theater, it took my friends and me about 20 minutes to find the exit. So after clearing the line of officers, I didn’t know where to run. Frankly, I don’t remember deciding to run in any particular direction. I kept my eyes focused on the back of my friend’s head and booked it, trusting the rest of our group was doing the same and was close behind me.

The next few minutes — I think; I have no idea how long this chaos lasted — are a complete blur. We darted into a multi-level Macy’s, and it was eerily quiet and empty. A handful of items littered the floor and indistinct shouts echoed in the distance. We ran into an employee who, after the color left his cheeks for a moment at the report of the incident, directed us quickly toward a storage closet where he said we could hide.

A sense of calm washed over me for the first time at the thought of a door we could lock ourselves behind. But after surveying the confined space, the men in our group insisted we press on to find an exit. It was better, they reasoned, to risk exposure than to be sitting ducks. We kept moving.

I panicked as I realized we were missing one of our friends.

“Where is he? Where is he?” I repeated involuntarily.

“There — escalator!” another one in our group pointed to where the missing friend was standing, motioning us toward him.

Once on the escalator, I became acutely aware of our vulnerability as we descended in perpetual motion toward an unknown area. But the only person waiting for us at the bottom was another kind employee who signaled us toward the door to the outside, risking her safety to help us and others. Almost there.

We poured out the door into a sea of red and blue flashing lights — everywhere. The surrounding blocks were teeming with people, moviegoers and mall shoppers, unsure where to go. Mothers scurried away with their sobbing toddlers, and groups of friends checked head counts to ensure everyone escaped. Each of us called our parents and friends to assure them of our safety, unsure of the degree of damage on the inside and how fast word would travel outside the several-block perimeter of mayhem.

I didn’t feel safe again until our Uber driver dropped us all off at my apartment.

The Definition of Trauma

My friends and I talked about the incident at length — and then we talked about it several more times. I haven’t thought of much else since that night. Each morning since, I’ve hurled out of bed, an overwhelming feeling that something isn’t right cutting through a splitting headache, until I remember it all at once.

The latest reports indicate there was no shooter. The Washington Post reported the alleged perpetrator was an “unidentified juvenile male.” That’s it. No real danger. Just some punk kid.

As I’ve told the story, I feel foolish talking about how “dangerous” it was or how “vulnerable” we were. It feels wrong to call the events of that night “traumatic.”

But the fact is, they were. In that moment, we didn’t know there wasn’t a shooter. It wasn’t like a workplace fire drill in which everyone takes his sweet time moseying down the stairs, coffee in hand, knowing full well none of the door handles will be hot. The threat may not have been real, but we didn’t know that. That fear was one of the strongest emotions I’ve ever felt.

Our Minds and Hearts Are Not Well

Yet it pales in comparison to the fear others have felt when it’s still some punk kid, but not a prank — when somebody calls out “active shooter” because bodies are falling. I don’t pretend to have any idea what those survivors feel in the aftermath.

But as I reflect on this experience, I don’t think about the guns or the lack of them. The efficacy of our laws isn’t the first thing that comes to mind, nor the security of movie theaters. What strikes me most is that one of the same impulses that may drive a person to actually shoot another human being is the one that may drive them to intentionally evoke fear and panic without any weapon except the power of speech.

What compels a person to do that? Deriving pleasure from others’ fear is a special kind of ill. It’s the subject of horror films, frankly. This kid hasn’t been apprehended yet, to my knowledge, which makes me wonder how his actions will affect others.

The lack of human casualties in this instance conjures the utmost gratefulness. But with only two words, one person still caused extreme damage: material, economic, emotional, mental — I could go on. People abandoned their belongings. Stores appeared ransacked. Businesses closed early. The cinema’s economic losses that evening are utterly minute compared with the future fiscal sucker punch. Who would dare patronize that theater in the coming days and weeks? (Regal’s follow-up email promotion offering a free small popcorn probably won’t be enough to lure me back.)

How many people in the surrounding area will avoid movies and malls altogether? Consider the waste of police resources. How many parents who were present will think twice before they take their children out again? They’ll most likely stay home on the weekends, at least for a while.

And all for what?

We don’t have a gun problem, we have a people problem, a heart problem, a mental problem — and you can’t legislate those away. Causing widespread terror cost that kid nothing. He simply opened his mouth. Who needs to undergo a background check when you could simply take a deep breath and bellow? How many more resources will we waste, how many more politicians will pontificate about gun control, until we admit that we as a culture are spiritually abysmal, mentally sick, morally bankrupt, and simply desolate?

The Source of Our Cultural Decline

Writing in The Federalist in August, Thane Bellamo diagnosed the disease infecting this generation, of which our cultural decline is a grave symptom:

When we talk about gun violence, just about no one talks about these root causes. It is not as if we haven’t had large numbers of powerful semi-automatic weapons in this country for many decades. … [T]he only sensible question to ask is, what has changed? Instead, politicians and pundits ask all the wrong questions. Do we have too many guns? (We always have.) Are video games and movies too violent? (They always have been.) Do we need more laws? (We have more than we can keep track of.) No, the thing that has fundamentally changed is that we have discarded those regulating social institutions that have helped people understand their value and place in this world for thousands of years. Their decline is not just mirrored in the rise of mass shootings, but more broadly in a host of statistics that reveal an epidemic of despair.

And despair we do, whether bullets are fired or not. Bellamo illustrates a rise in drug overdoses, suicides, and out-of-wedlock births at the same time church membership has sharply declined.

I wish I could offer a policy solution, but I simply can’t. The only cure is found in the gospel, in social and religious institutions this nation is abandoning. Short of returning to them, no amount of security theater or government solutions will restore anything. Stripping away our guns won’t heal our sick minds. And recognizing that isn’t downplaying the danger; it’s simply being honest about it.

I hope the next time I’m having a nightmare, it ceases when I open my eyes. But until we acknowledge that our real problems are depraved hearts, not hardware, I fear we will keep reliving this horrifying dream.

Tlaib Insists It’s Not Racist To Say White People Can’t Be Police Analysts,"Critics from across the political spectrum are wary of the Detroit Police Department’s (DPD) use of facial recognition software to curb violent crime. Their concerns range from whether the technology violates the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, if and by what factor a largely unmonitored surveillance system successfully deters crime, and the known shortcomings in facial detection algorithms’ ability to identify the faces of African-American people, particularly women.

When freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who represents portions of Detroit, visited the DPD’s Real Time Crime Center, she cited a different concern. “Analysts need to be African Americans,” Tlaib told Detroit’s police chief, James Craig. “Not people that are not. I think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same.”

From a woman who has been quick to accuse opponents of racism, the remarks were shocking. Even more unbelievable was Tlaib’s Friday Detroit News op-ed, in which she alleged her words “weren’t racist.”

The representative’s comment referenced a phenomenon known as the cross-race effect, which supposes people identify members of their own race more accurately than they do members of other races. Detroit’s population is about 80 percent African American. Citing the cross-race effect in her demand that the DPD hire all African Americans analysts implies Tlaib believes African Americans commit 100 percent of violent crime in the city.

Speaking to the Detroit News about the representative’s “insulting” comments, which he said left both black and white analysts “outraged,” Craig provided an alternative interpretation. “To say people should be barred from working somewhere because of their skin color? That’s racist.”

Attacking Before She Knows Anything

Tlaib’s tense visit to the Real Time Crime Center occurred on the heels of inappropriate and acrimonious online jabbing. On August 20, Tlaib tweeted that the DPD “should probably rethink this whole facial recognition bulls**t.” Using foul language to cover a lack of content is nothing new for Tlaib, who is preparing for her next campaign by selling apparel splashed with her uncouth rallying cry of “impeach the mother-cker.”

The DPD responded by inviting Tlaib to the center to witness how the department “responsibly use[s] [technology] in efforts to identify criminals involved in violent crimes.”

Setting the tone for her September 30 visit, Tlaib asked a Detroit News reporter taping the meeting if he was “facial recognizing [her] right now.”

Afterwards, Craig gave the representative a crash course on how his department’s analysts use the software to apprehend violent criminals. In the Detroit News video of the visit, Tlaib often appears unwilling to learn, informing Craig she comes to him “from a place of fully understanding [the issues with facial recognition software].”

Tlaib’s remarks, particularly her racist comments, prove she is far from solidly understanding the shortcomings of facial recognition techniques. She was also disrespectful of the men and women more than 550 Detroit businesses and entities entrust with their safety through Project Green Light.

How Project Green Light Began

Project Green Light began in 2016, after the DPD recognized that 25 percent “of violent crime in the city [occurred] within 500 feet of gas stations.” The DPD partnered initially with eight local gas stations. They installed real-time security cameras and placed green lights outside to signal to patrons and would-be-criminals that DPD monitored their cameras.

In late 2017, the city brought Face Plus facial recognition software to Project Green Light and the Real Time Crime Center. Although the technology is capable of real-time facial analysis, the DPD, according to Craig, does not “monitor innocent people in real time.” Only if there is an “articulable reasonable suspicion that an individual is observed or reported to have committed a crime” will a “still image [be] provided for analysis.”

While long-term studies of Project Green Light’s effects have not been completed, at a press conference in March, Craig stated car-jackings have decreased by 50 percent in three years. Additionally, the city experienced a 45 percent decline in robberies during the first quarter of 2019.

The DPD’s use of facial recognition technology went unmonitored for 18 months before the department settled a privacy policy in July. The policy aimed to ensure facial recognition software would not violate the First, Fourth, or Fourteenth Amendments, does not target specific groups of individuals based on “religious, political or social views,” and does not target individuals based on ethnic background or citizenship status.

Directive 307.5, governing the use of facial recognition technology, was passed in an 8-3 vote by the Detroit Police Board of Commissioners on September 19. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, the nine-page document limits the DPD’s sharing of its technology with outside agencies, identifies individuals responsible for oversight of the facial recognition program, and outlines penalties for those found violating the policy. Importantly, it states that facial recognition matches are “not to be considered a positive identification of any subject,” but rather must be corroborated through thorough investigation.

A number of legitimate areas for concern remain regarding DPD’s facial recognition software use, several enumerated in a June 2019 report on Project Green Light. The report states DPD has supposedly installed “hidden neighborhood cameras” in an effort to find illegal garbage dumpers, notes a sensation confessed by some Detroit business owners that they are “paying for policing,” and alleges the police prioritize Project Green Light locations over non-Project Green Light locations. Additionally, the report cites concerns that Project Green Light may not prove a long-term deterrent to criminals, as locations are only patrolled virtually one time each day.

I Know More about Racism than You, Chief

Tlaib’s visit to the Real Time Crime Center, however, did not focus on legitimate concerns about possible DPD overreach or the effects of Project Green Light. Rather, she seemed intent on ensuring Craig, who began his police career in 1977, benefitted from her expertise.

Tlaib’s frequent interruptions were designed to catch Craig and his department in misbehavior, which came into focus when Craig put his software’s shortcomings on display. Craig demonstrated how it identified an African American male suspect as an African American female. “The computer, not [the analyst]” Craig began to explain, before Tlaib cut him off.

Local Support for Project Green Light

Although murder, assault, rape, and robbery decreased in Detroit from 2017 to 2018, FBI statistics released on September 30 show that, in 2018, Detroit still ranked as the most violent big city in the nation.

In a city of 139 square miles, Project Green Light allows a force of 2,200 officers, whose response times are among the longest in the nation, to better protect Detroit citizens. As shown in a map of Project Green Light locations on the DPD’s website, Detroit’s efforts have found plentiful partners. The city boasted more than 568 Project Green Light locations in July, with an additional 80 businesses “in the pipeline.”

That Tlaib would disregard the public buy-in of Detroit residents to a program they feel increases their safety is no surprise.

Clement Brown, the owner of several clothing stores in downtown Detroit, the Detroit News reported in March that “thieves drove a truck through the window” of one of his storefronts in 2018. Although Brown initially worried over the cost to join Project Green Light, an upfront fee of $4,000 to $6,000, and an additional $150 per month for video storage, he stated “it’s definitely worth it.”

The Detroit Housing Commission used a federal grant to upgrade bring Project Green Light to a community of elderly and near-elderly Detroit residents in November 2018. At a community meeting attended by Craig and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to gauge residents’ interest, an attendee interviewed by the Detroit Free Press said “almost all” of the 50 to 60 residents who attended “were for [Project Green Light].”

Yet, in July, Tlaib sponsored a bill that would prohibit the use of facial recognition software in public housing around the nation. “We cannot allow residents…to be criminalized and marginalized with the use of…facial recognition technology,” Tlaib stated. After her visit to the Real Time Crime Center, Tlaib indicated she still believed it would be “dehumanizing to have surveillance” in public housing.

That Tlaib would disregard the public buy-in of Detroit residents to a program they feel increases their safety is no surprise. The representative has a history of prioritizing her beliefs over her constituents.

The effectiveness of and privacy concerns regarding Project Green Light and the Real Time Crime Center deserve to be thoroughly investigated and addressed, particularly as the DPD prepares to expand the programs. Tlaib’s visit to the DPD made no progress on this score.

Her racist comments prove the representative maintains an ignorance of the algorithmic and human shortcomings that lead to racial bias in facial recognition, or believes that, in Detroit, only people of color commit violent crimes. By doubling down on those comments, and alleging in her Detroit News editorial that the DPD is using “broken technology…to lock up black and brown people in Detroit,” Tlaib shows she took nothing away from her grandstanding visit to the Real Time Crime Center.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/07/tlaib-insists-its-not-racist-to-say-white-people-cant-be-police-analysts/,2019-10-07
Left Exploits Inaccurate Stories Of Transgender Victims For Political Gain,"For the last several years, it has become common to see headlines sounding the alarm that violence against transgender people is at crisis levels. This is especially true of men living as women who aren’t white. Each year we see rolling counts of how many transgender people have been murdered “so far” this year.

The issue has become a rite of passage for Democratic presidential candidates and was featured in the recent Democratic debates focusing on LGBTQ issues. When asked what she planned to do for LGBTQ Americans during her first 100 days in office, Sen. Elizabeth Warren answered by reading the names of several transgender people reported as murdered. Warren concluded, “It is time for a president of the United States of America to say their names.”

What Happened to Muhlaysia Booker?

One name that has become a prominent representation of the reported crisis is Muhlaysia Booker. In April 2019, Booker became a celebrated activist after a video of a group of people brutally beating Booker was widely shared on social media. A month later, Booker was found shot to death on a street in Dallas, Texas.

On Oct. 4, 2019, ABC News tweeted out a “Nightline” profile of Booker’s story with a video of friends and family sharing memories. It also included a brief clip of the beating without context. To the observer, it appears Booker was targeted for mob violence and then murdered because Booker was a transgender person.

The details behind the beating do not support this portrayal, however. In April, Booker accidentally backed into another car, and the driver drove Booker off the road in an attempt to prevent Booker from fleeing. According to Booker, the other driver pointed a gun at Booker and demanded payment for the damage to his car before he would allow Booker to leave. A crowd gathered around the altercation, and an unidentified person offered Edward Dominic Thomas, 29, $200 to beat Booker.

The video of the incident shows multiple men violently attacking Booker as a large crowd surrounds them, shouting and cheering. Although Out Magazine indicated the video shows bystanders hurling homophobic and misogynistic slurs and Booker reported the attackers used homophobic slurs, the video did not clearly indicate it, nor did the police confirm it. During an interview with police, Thomas admitted to the assault but claimed not to have engaged in any derogatory language toward the victim. Thomas has since been arrested and is awaiting trial for the assault.

Police arrested Booker’s possible murderer in connection with a string of other murders in the area. CBS News referred to the accused as a serial killer. According to Dallas police, Kendrell Lavar Lyles, 34, was known to frequent an area where transgender people sell sex. On May 18, 2019, three hours before her death, witnesses say Booker got into Lyles’ car on this street.

Lyles was already charged for two other murders when police made the connection thanks to his possession of Booker’s cell phone. He is believed to have murdered three people during the month of May, including one woman he knew personally and a woman he planned to sell illegal drugs to via facebook. A second transgender person was reported as his fourth victim, but police have now determined that person committed suicide.

Dishonesty About Transgender Victims

Another woman was murdered in the same area about the same time, after being stabbed multiple times, and in October, a gay man in drag, who was incorrectly identified by police as a transgender woman, was found fatally shot in a parked car. The young man, Traylon Brown, preferred to go out in drag to pick up men, and his mother believes his murder was the result of a burglary and not “hate.”

Booker’s family also said they do not believe Booker was targeted for being transgender. Booker’s aunt told local reporters she believes police are simply trying to “satisfy” the public with these connections but she thinks the murder was over a personal dispute.

High-profile and LGBT advocacy media have not reported any of these details, nor the context of the local area in which multiple unrelated murders have recently occurred. The fact that Booker was initially the victim of a road rage incident in which a career criminal held Booker at gunpoint and then he and his group publicly beat Booker over a fender-bender, and the fact that Booker was then murdered by a likely serial killer targeting the area Booker worked in, seem irrelevant to the narrative. But Booker’s story tells us a great deal about the threat of gang and drug violence in urban areas and the high risks of prostitutio, but it tells us nothing about any specific threat to transgender women, of color or otherwise.

When Warren expressed a need for political leaders to “say the names” of transgender victims, the symbolic action strengthened the idea that, as ABC News puts it, “Saying their names out loud served as a larger call for attention and action to an issue that largely goes underreported.” The Human Rights Campaign reported 145 murders of transgender people since 2013 but lamented the violence is “hard to track due to misgendering — incorrectly applying gender labels — and transphobia.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has specifically called for trans-specific protections to address the issue. But a look at news reporting betrays this notion. Since the initial assault, Muhlaysia Booker has been cited nearly 350 times in world media. The judge in the upcoming trail of Thomas, the man accused of beating Booker in the traffic incident, specifically required the use of the victim’s preferred name rather than Booker’s birth name. The primary concern was ensuring the jury did not view the incident as a “fight between two men” but rather as a man beating a woman.

In the effort to force an emotional narrative that simply refuses to be true, LGBT advocacy and the media place the vulnerable lives they seek to bring awareness to in more danger. The media’s focus on the racial attributes of the victims, as ABC News did, saying, “Trans women of color particularly are at steep risk of marginalization, violence, and erasure,” further diminishes the issue. The assumption is that nonwhite trans people are more often targeted because of their race when, in fact, the known assailants largely share their racial attributes. They have given us nothing to “act” against.

Democrats’ Transgender Narrative Is Political Marketing

What trans-specific protections would have saved Booker’s life? Vox even articulated this concern by arguing policies that remove sex work online force prostitutes onto the streets, where they are in far more physical danger. The threat is environmental, not social.

The only reason Booker’s name is so well known compared to the other people her alleged killer also allegedly murdered is Booker’s usefulness to the current LGBT message of fear and panic. Sadly, Booker’s own life choices, environment, and the truth seem far less interesting to advocacy groups who feel entitled to exploit Booker’s life for political marketing.

The ongoing reporting of transgender murders as a collective pattern of hatred and targeted violence is a powerful tool the Democratic Party is using to emotionally manipulate voters into believing they alone can somehow protect vulnerable Americans. But the truth is absolutely nothing can be done that is not already in place that would specifically protect transgender people from the same violence women face in dangerous environments related to domestic abuse, sex work, drugs, or living in high-crime areas.

This violence is not somehow more of a critical issue when it happens to a person who is also transgender. Diminishing the lives of non-transgender victims does nothing to further the cause of equality. Neither does manipulating the facts to make the public believe there is a specific threat that one political party exaggerates and the other resolves.

The lives of these victims will never be honored as long as they are exploited for a false narrative only used to spread fear and hatred. Saying their names to bring awareness to the true violence at hand is positive. Doing so to perpetuate a lie is cruel.

Three Days Among The Freedom Protesters In Hong Kong,"On a gray, humid day in June, a 35-year-old man named Marco Leung climbed atop a platform on elevated scaffolding outside the ritzy complex known as Pacific Place in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong, and announced he was tired of being ignored. He wore a bright yellow raincoat festooned with slogans — in the days to come, Hong Kong protesters would brand him “Raincoat Man” — and he unfurled a lengthy sign saying in English and Chinese: “No extradition to China, total withdrawal of the extradition bill, we are not rioters, release the students and injured, Carrie Lam step down, help Hong Kong.”

In the hours to come, police and firefighters would swarm the area. Negotiators attempted to convince him to come down, but he refused. Firefighters ended up confronting Leung, who, after climbing away from them outside the railings, fell about 60 feet to his death, missing an inflated police cushion. It was branded a suicide, the first of eight since the Hong Kong protests began, though the macabre footage doesn’t really bear that out.

Leung was no radical, at least until recently. He had previously indicated support of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, an establishment group, and backed establishment candidates on social media as recently as 2016. He backed Wong Kwok-hing, among others, who lost his seat to the more aggressively pro-democracy Roy Kwong — a Democracy Party legislator who was at Leung’s protest that day, urging him to come down safely. The police declined to let Kwong participate — so he crossed the road and used a loudspeaker instead, ultimately to no avail.

https://twitter.com/ray_slowbeat/status/1139916118804451328

After his death, Leung’s parents spoke out through a friend, urging on the young people of Hong Kong. “Every brave citizen who takes to the street is doing so because they love Hong Kong deeply. Only by protecting themselves and staying alive can young people continue to speak up bravely against social injustices.”

The location Leung chose indicates the way the Hong Kong protesters cut across lines of culture and class. While a “V for Vendetta” slogan is spray-painted a stone’s throw from where he hit the ground — “People shouldn’t be afraid of their government, governments should be afraid of their people” — this is no class uprising. It is instead a broad cross-section of Hong Kong’s 7 million citizens who are joining in: blue and white collar, those of wealth and middle class, sons and daughters delaying their college education to join in.

At the luxuriant lounge in the JW Marriott, housed within the Pacific Place complex, about a hundred American dollars buys entry to a buffet of endless caviar, seared foie gras, lobster thermidor, fresh langoustines, mussels, crab legs, shrimp dumplings, lamb pops, roasted beef and pork, roasted squab, sushi, fruits and cheeses of all manner, four kinds of aged ham, three kinds of smoked salmon, bespoke Asian noodle dishes, and bottomless wine and champagne. The tourists are mostly from the mainland: The men wear “Avengers” T-shirts and drawstring shorts with Nikes, while the women dress in shimmering summer blouses and flowing skirts with ankle boots.

Upper-middle-class people gorge while the middle class goes for an esteemed mother’s birthday. She loves her gift of Italian perfume from the mega complex beneath us, five floors of an adult playground of shopping and excess that rivals any high-end American mega mall. All the brands are there, though a group of college-aged girls express disappointed sounds outside the Celine store that is not yet open.

The doors are where you notice it first. The heavy metal door hangings are bound in multiple ways, M-shaped locks paired with chains and padlocks, plus sandbags and interlocked metal barriers at other entrances. It creates mazes where shoppers have to backtrack and ride the same escalator twice. When you do the circuit, it’s easy to spot the choke points. That’s where you’ll find men in suits who look tired and hold radios or have earbuds, wearing sunglasses, always watchful.

This is the same complex where just a few months ago, Leung would be the first death in a series of protests that would rock Hong Kong. Over the course of the past 19 weeks, protesters have taken to the streets all over the city. They have engaged in all manner of behavior. Several of them have died, all reportedly by suicide. Not all the protesters believe that’s the real reason. But others claim the despair is so great among the youths of the city that suicide is very predictable.

When you talk to the people who are behind the democracy movement, to the protesters and the organizers and the organizer-adjacent, you can view the motives that have animated the streets for the past 19-plus weeks as existing within a broader context of conflict over autonomy and self-determination. If you are a young Hong Konger, in your late 20s to early 30s, you remember the past before the handoff. You are mindful of the years when Hong Kong had a higher degree of autonomy that would presumably be protected. You see what you are losing in the current moment — and that’s what makes you take to the streets.

The current protests are being framed by the West as the first in Hong Kong in the era of comprehensive digital media and social communication that can bypass the restrictions of the state. That’s true to an extent — much of what’s happened in the past weeks here has focused on that audience. But what separates this from the past, such as the Umbrella Revolution, is that the whole city is all in on this, existentially, regardless of class divide. This despite the wishful thinking of the likes of Russia Today, the propaganda network of Vladimir Putin, which compared the protesters to classist uprisers from the film series “The Purge,” splicing clips together between the violent American movie and the acts of protesters in the city.

That level of deadly violence, as waged by the protesters, is absent, but there is violence nonetheless — petrol fire bombs, sharp objects, and vandalism abound. Graffiti is omnipresent, but painted over lazily, as if the cleaners know that they will be back to do the same task again the next morning. The city does not feel like a powder keg — more like a solid pot that looks safe and cool to the touch, but inside hides a roiling boil that will burn you in an instant.

Hawley’s Night with Hong Kong Protesters

The night one policeman’s neck was slashed, Sen. Josh Hawley, freshman Republican from Missouri, was in the streets with the protesters, bearing witness to their actions and the response of the police.

A white Kia emblazoned with graffiti, smashed and broken open with its contents spilled on the ground, was a short half-block from the main street. According to protesters, the occupant inside had presented himself as a journalist, but was in reality a cop embedded within the movement. Whether true or not, the protesters had exacted their revenge on his vehicle, cracking it open like an egg and feathering it with fliers and leaflets.

After a few minutes of press attention, clad in yellow jackets, streaming in a multitude of languages, holding up their various electronic devices in the spitting rain, came the sound of shouts that in any language reveal the the oncoming threat of Five-O. “Be Water” is the mantra of the protesters now — a reference to their own Bruce Lee, who said, “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it.” Instead of seeking physical confrontation with the cops, now they flow away from the high ground in all directions, and regroup.

The cops roll in en masse, prompting a scurry of masked individuals from the scene. They run in all directions as bus after bus unloads masked police officers, clad in armor and bulky gear, wielding large shields and bellowing orders. They surround the scene and push back anyone in the area, blocking the nearby intersection. They carry tear gas guns and batons, with no identifying badge numbers, and if you try to take their picture even of their glaring eyes, they unleash a torrent of epilepsy-inducing strobe lights.

Hawley, a slim athletic man who looks more like a health nut executive than a senator, loped through the cross streets, standing head and shoulders above the crowd, talking variously with protesters and with press, taking pictures on his own phone to share with the Western world. His staff had to work to pull him away from the scene, even when the loudspeakers are ordering crowds to disperse.

The protesters and organizers know who Hawley is, and some even mention that he is the youngest senator. It is a funny thing to hear Hong Kong twentysomethings with a greater knowledge of American civics than the average U.S. voter — especially when they query about subcommittee hearings and unanimous consent. The interest of the protest-adjacent leadership is in the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act — authored originally by Marco Rubio, with more than 30 bipartisan co-sponsors. Whether it would result in meaningful impact on Hong Kong’s situation or not, it would be a signal to Hong Kong and Beijing and other nations as well about the way these protests are perceived.

An older woman, unmasked and barefoot, wearing a flowery orange and pink dress, stands on the corner of the intersection, letting the police have it. A call and response develops between the different corners as members of the press crowd around the woman. The protesters are not throwing anything at the police or engaging in physical action, but they are daring them to do what they have seen them do for weeks: to beat the citizens they are supposed to protect, not for doing anything wrong, but for the things they dare to say. Everyone is waiting for something to break.

This time, the cops hold back. They know the next 24 hours will potentially bring an even bigger demonstration, and don’t want to make another martyr on the eve of a public spectacle. They set about clearing the makeshift barricade protesters had arranged — a rather impressive mix of trash cans, traffic signs, concrete, and rebar. Well-dressed shopkeepers along the main drag peer through metal slats they bring down whenever the sirens draw near.

In between the stores and shops, the graffiti blanketing wooden barriers alternates between Cantonese and English, expressing all manner of viewpoints — but all anti-cop. Some words indicated the cops were working hand in glove with the local Triads criminal operation, something that has been accused multiple times. Others focused more blatantly on the mainland, including one saying, “Pooh is watching,” Winnie the Pooh being a stand-in for President Xi. Recently, a particularly enterprising protester set up a broadcast allowing for the “South Park” episode “Band in China” featuring just that reference to be displayed after it was, well, banned in China.

These are the types of tactics these young, technologically adept and passionate protesters are engaged in. A strobe light from an anonymous cop’s shoulder doesn’t really stand a chance against it. In the morning, Hawley will describe the scene in Hong Kong to the Western press as a “police state” — prompting Hong Kong’s chief politician Carrie Lam to disagree. It is hard to see how he is wrong.

I chose the words “police state” purposely – because that is exactly what Hong Kong is becoming. I saw it myself. If Carrie Lam wants to demonstrate otherwise, here’s an idea: resign https://t.co/sulX0v4KCv — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019

American Response and Corporate Censorship

In recent weeks, this story took on new life in America and the West thanks to some odd flashpoints. For America, much of it was focused on the issue of the National Basketball Association. The NBA has an extreme foothold here — 17 percent of its revenue comes from China, and it had the misfortune this month to discover that this Hong Kong issue was creeping into the overall tour that was going on promoting the basketball association in China, featuring some of its biggest stars.

After Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey had the audacity to retweet an image meme supporting freedom in Hong Kong, the Chinese flipped, and Americans flipped even more when they saw how quickly various woke athletes and administrators in the NBA, who have made politics a centerpiece of their appeal in recent years, were willing to bend the knee to the Chinese communists. The most recent was LeBron James, whose cowardly comments trended on Twitter hours after the massive protests took over Hong Kong streets again.

James called for Morey to educate himself. Well, we’re all in need of a good re-education, from time to time.

This was the Top Tweet I saw as I switched from my burner after three days in Hong Kong among the protesters. Look into the eyes of a young Hong Konger who has seen her friends beaten and imprisoned and spout this bullshit. I have never hated LeBron until this instant. https://t.co/8kMSbtbqoj — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) October 15, 2019

In the category of video games, an outburst from a gamer within the Blizzard universe led to crackdowns and apologies that rocketed around a world of advanced E-gamers who have become far more popular than ever before, even rivaling great physical athletes. Protesters also saw the bending of the knee from other corporations, such as Apple, which deleted the HKmap.live app being used by some protesters to track the activities of police in Hong Kong. But it was hardly their only app.

In Hong Kong, it’s understood that not everyone can take the black or wear a mask. For their part, the white-collar protesters are doing their best to hide. They are canceling their own social media accounts. They are trying to prevent themselves from being connected to their businesses for any political expressions. They are worried about the accountability and the enforcement mechanisms used by authoritarian regimes that can control the access to billions of potential customers. But they still are showing up to the protests, such as those on Monday that clogged the streets with peaceful demonstrators.

Meanwhile, the police union has asked for permission to fire at will on protesters who use various implements:

Authorities have already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters on Thursday, as they struggle to stamp out anti-government protests that have rocked Hong Kong for nearly four months. The loosening of restrictions on the use of force by police came into effect just before some of the most violent turmoil yet at protests on Tuesday, when a teenaged secondary school student was shot by an officer in the chest and wounded — the first time a demonstrator had been hit by live fire. … Local media Now TV and Cable TV reported the changes to the police procedures manual took effect on Sept. 30, the day before Tuesday’s violence at widespread protests on China’s National Day, during which the student was shot. … The updated guidelines also removed a line that said “officers will be accountable for their own actions”, stating only that “officers on the ground should exercise their own discretion to determine what level of force is justified in a given situation”.

Police have shot one protester already with live ammunition. The protesters expect there will be more. On the mainland, the focus has been on economic policy and welfare, and Carrie Lam would like to stick to that. But in reality, these protests are about a lot more than that. They are about the future of a Hong Kong that many people see as slipping away, one that young people in particular fear they are losing. The protests started with concerns that the extradition law would mean the end of Hong Kong as they know it. Now, it’s about something much bigger.

After multiple incidents where the cops are seen as having whitewashed the facts, they have lost the assumption among the citizenry that they are telling the truth. Already, political activists are fleeing to other countries. Elderly groups who attempt to protect the children have already incited police incidents. Religious freedom concerns are rising, particularly about the Chinese state wanting to set up boards to infiltrate and alter those assumptions of religious schools. The crackdown on free internet is constantly feared. A government official who was asked about this on the radio recently was quoted as saying, “Never say never.”

This Hong Kong Protest Is Different From the Past

This is not the first era of protest in Hong Kong since the handover in 1997. Previous protests, such as the Umbrella Revolution, were overwhelmingly peaceful, but there is now a feeling that a peaceful approach has not been entirely effective, particularly in an era in which police appear ready to engage in escalating levels of violence.

For years, pro-democracy advocates who feared that Beijing would crack down on the city system they know and love restrained themselves, participating almost exclusively in nonviolent protest. They would march with permits, organize under the existing law, and generally not buck the system they inhabit.

This feels different.

Joshua Wong, a student activist who was at the center of both Umbrella and other protests in the past, who was standing in jail when he saw the nearly 2 million people come out to protest peacefully in the streets back in July, is concerned that this is a moment in which Hong Kong could see its autonomy seriously slip away, based not just on its own situation but on the international priorities of President Xi.

These are the sorts of concerns echoed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Wearing all black in sympathy for the protesters, he visited key figures in Hong Kong this past week and spoke to the West on “Face the Nation.” A spokesman for Beijing reportedly said he would no longer be welcome in Hong Kong, something which Cruz may be likely to test in the future.

The use of excessive force is an underlying element of all of the protesters’ complaints. They say police remove gas masks from protesters who are trying to resist the tear gas the officers throw. They use water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets. They take gas masks even off journalists, and they arbitrarily arrest bystanders. During the Umbrella protests, there were only eight arrests of cops for use of excessive force, stemming from two incidents. And according to protester counts, in the past four months, the police in Hong Kong have deployed 3,000 gas canisters, compared to 89 during the entirety of the Umbrella protests.

The establishment on the island, made up of both politicians and tycoons who work within the financial sector, have largely favored what Beijing and the mainland has favored in recent years. But the threat of an extradition law that would have rolled back the authority of Hong Kong to adjudicate criminal matters regarding its citizens proved a bridge too far. Not wanting to displease the political authorities but wanting to maintain their authority, a few of these corporate citizens have broken from the rest of the herd.

Mainland China is not interested in such breakage. It is demanding more and more the kind of fealty one would expect from an authoritarian regime.

Hong Kong Protesters Have Big Demands

The protesters have five demands — a series of issues they want to be at the centerpiece of the conversation over the next week as the Legislative Council meets for the first time since these protests began. Carrie Lam, under siege politically and facing falling popularity, is set to give an agenda-setting speech, though it’s unclear whether security concerns will allow her to give it in person.

The mask ban is a key point of dispute here. It attracted international attention recently, designed to crack down on the ability of protesters to keep their identities secret. It was not a legislative action, but an executive one — a step undertaken outside the process. Protesters fear it is a sign of what will come.

Rather than being motivated by independence, the protesters in Hong Kong are focused on the issue of autonomy — a form of autonomy they have experienced for decades. They see within the expansion of President Xi’s power the threat to that existence and to the one country, two systems approach. These protests are more connected to other populist movements around the world, of the past and the present, than external observers have acknowledged. It took over a year of open combat before the Americans gave up on their original aim of self-governance under the crown and went for independence in the 1700s. Radicalization takes time, but when it comes, it comes in a torrent. All around the world, people are tired of being governed by leaders who do not care how they vote. Hong Kong is joining them in this.

The possibility that the Hong Kong authorities will use colonial powers to suspend habeas corpus, defy the public will, and crack down in violent fashion on these protests is very real. Wong predicts that protests will continue, regardless of what is done when the Legislative Council meets or when elections are held. The fear is that Hong Kong is being turned into a police state beholden to Beijing, where these crackdowns are viewed as necessary to keep up appearances to the outside world. But that is harder in an era of ever-present smartphones.

Beijing is primarily focused on containment. It does not want to see the kind of protest happening in Hong Kong spread to other key cities under its regime, but there are other schools of thought as well. If Beijing does let the unrest fester, it could be because Beijing sees the potential lesson for other citizens: Protests damage the economy, and it can say to others on the mainland, “See what happens when you want freedom and sovereignty?” At the moment, it is mostly the mid-tier industries affected by these protests, tourism and the like. This is a real problem. The malls are half-filled with the types of people who normally shop there. New deals only do so much to offset the ever-present reminders.

What the protesters are demanding is big. For one, universal suffrage: In the current system the powers that be, anointed by Beijing, are the ones who pick the candidates people can vote on. Real universal suffrage would include the people’s ability to pick their own candidates for key positions. For another, the rejection of the label “rioters,” one that carries with it a 10-year potential imprisonment. And it is unlikely any of the protests will dissipate absent an independent commission looking into the police response. For big demands like this, the peaceful protests of the past did not result in the kind of changes they wanted to achieve.

In July, almost a quarter of the island’s population came out to peacefully protest, and while that led to Carrie Lam’s decision to pull the extradition bill back, it did not lead to the kind of shifts those protesters really wanted to see, ones that would clearly indicate that the powerful had heard the complaints of the island citizenry over the encroaching reach of the mainland. Instead, protesters are left to appeal to the international community. Some are even hoping for the direction of sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, including severe economic sanctions against those found to have engaged in human rights abuses, freezing or seizing their assets and canceling their family visas to the West.

As the danger to autonomy increases, the response from Hong Kong’s citizenry becomes more strict and more aggressive. The differences between past protests are clear. This one is leaderless. Leaderless movements are better, the protesters tell me, because they cannot be shut down just by arresting one person.

The protesters who have engaged in more violent activity, including the throwing of petrol bombs and the like, damaging property, and setting up barricades, have been branded by the media as radical. But the protest activists call them brave.

This is a matter the activists believe has been an increasing problem for the police force in Hong Kong. The cops hide their badge numbers and their faces so they cannot be identified, and so even when protesters attempt to report the kind of brutality they readily experienced and for which there is a significant amount of video and photographic evidence, there is no way to attach those complaints to an actual officer. Protesters say this is the worst they’ve ever seen it, that the government tactics are escalating. They now risk violence eagerly and say the police complaint mechanism is broken, where anonymity prevents any useful accountability.

Protests are now being routinely redefined as inherently unlawful, where no permission is granted for the kind of peaceful exhibitions that had existed in the past, so there is no incentive to organize peacefully. The police have lost credibility, and Hong Kong now has no safety valve. In response, some within the protest movement have engaged in mob violence. “Take care of it ourselves” is the mantra, including vigilante justice against those individuals the mob believes have engaged in behavior that hurts their cause. It’s one thing when that means boycotting a shop. It’s another when it extends to beating up the shopkeeper.

Protesters Aren’t Giving Up

The Hong Kongers took the streets again on Monday night, with a specific focus on U.S. policy. There were hundreds of thousands of them, surrounding buildings, raising flags, singing songs. There was no violence. They were happy and optimistic, uninterested in violence. They were trying to send a message.

Thousands of protesters rallied on Monday night to call for the support on the HK Human Rights and Democracy Act. It is also the first rally that obtained non-objection letter from the police since the #AntiMaskLaw is implemented.

Much of the intelligent analysis of populist uprisings in recent years has understood the central nature of autonomy to the appeal, right and left, of such anti-elite movements. Hong Kong should be seen as part of this. This is not just a student revolt. It is not a class revolt. It is a revolt on behalf of citizens demanding individual accountability. They look to the lot of young people losing hope and the rise of suicide among those who see a loss to their freedom, and they want a path that is cordoned by the nostalgia for the past.

An upcoming election could prove significant in terms of the ability of the city to let off steam, but this is a long-term problem. The people of Hong Kong see a government that is increasingly beholden to Beijing and the interests of the mainland, as opposed to responsive to its citizens. They see a government that is pushing for cameras in the classrooms to monitor which students are wearing masks or all black in school, showing an affinity for the protesters. They see the punishment for corporate leaders summoned to Beijing after expressions of solidarity with the protesters, and they fear that if the situation spirals further, significant crackdowns away from the cameras and protests could be the result.

The Hong Kong Human Rights and Diplomacy Act is scheduled for hearing in the House of Representatives this week. The political freedom of Hong Kong depends on Beijing, and no act of Congress will change that. But the protest community is more hopeful, because they believe they are being heard — that by taking on this endeavor while their autonomy still hangs in the balance, before it is stolen away by the mainland, they can look to the economic freedom of Western business as a reason why all is not lost.

Others are less optimistic. But when a fourth of your population demands something, there is a serious consequence when nothing happens — when millions of normal, law-abiding people feel their own autonomy, and the autonomy of their children, is at risk.

As one protester told me, with a smile: “We’re not afraid of tear gas anymore.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/15/be-brave-be-water-be-ready-three-days-among-the-freedom-protesters-in-hong-kong/,2019-10-15
"No, Bernie Sanders, Police Are Not Out To Get Black People","Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to perpetuate the myth that all law enforcement officers are somehow out to destroy black lives. When a student asked the presidential hopeful what he should do if he were pulled over by the police, Sanders said:

I would respect what they are doing so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head, but I would also be very mindful of the fact that as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit. I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with that police officer, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure if possible that police officer’s camera is on what goes on.

This advice may have elements of truth, but ultimately not enough. Sanders is correct that the student should “respect what they [law enforcement] are doing,” for officers have a certain amount of authority over citizens by law. But law enforcement should be respected not out of fear, but because of their essential role in our communities.

Sanders Perpetuates the Narrative That Police Are Corrupt

Sanders would have us believe our nation is missing the mark on law enforcement accountability. His statement comes after two attention-grabbing incidents in which police officers committed illegal actions. How could anyone forget the cases of Amber Guyger or the Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who killed a woman in her home? The officers in question were, however, held accountable, amid a wave of public revulsion.

Studies show some black people have an unfavorable view of law enforcement performance in their communities. But the studies don’t ask questions about what influences these views. Have these black people actually had a negative encounter with an officer? In that case, a negative view would be more than understandable.

But what if, having never directly experienced racial discrimination from a police officer, they’ve been swayed by the biases of friends and family members? People tend to believe something is true if they hear it repeated enough. When they latch onto it, they dismiss any evidence to the contrary.

Sanders and leaders of predominantly black communities (and I would argue all communities) should encourage citizens to find more constructive and positive ways to interact with law enforcement, and vice versa. Does it not bring a smile to one’s face to see a video of an officer of the law dancing with children or playing sports with young people?

Of course, these things happen all of the time. But people seem to forget about them because we are inundated with news that only shows the worst of interactions between law enforcement and minorities.

Law Enforcement Is Not ‘Institutionally Racist’

Whenever stories emerge involving a black person being slain at the hands of an officer, people quickly move to the tired (but useful for some) “America hates blacks” narrative. Some people don’t need an investigation before they adopt this tone. They believe they know the truth: that the institutional racism of yesterday is the exact same institutional racism of today.

Anyone who questions that argument is deemed a racist. Any black conservative who questions it is an “Uncle Tom.” This is not to say every black person ever killed by a white policeman was guilty or that the shooting was justified. However, to assume every instance is because of “institutional racism” or to come to a conclusion before all the facts are out is a disservice to the truth.

Another consideration: Many tend to forget and even dismiss the reality of a police officer’s job. Theirs is inherently dangerous work, and they have to be on their toes at all times. Not everything is so black and white. Politicians are not always the best at breaking down the gray areas of life.

Sanders could have asked the student to picture what it would be like to be in this situation. A more meticulous approach may have been controversial, but it would have been far more beneficial to the student. Yes, know your rights as a citizen. Also, know the rights of police officers.

Citizens and Officers Must Show Mutual Respect

Those in law enforcement should also concentrate on possible strategies that could diminish the number of interactions between themselves and citizens. For instance, a recent video came out that displayed a police officer wrestling an 11-year-old girl to the ground. While this was taking place, her school administrator told the officer she was not a threat. Although this policeman, who later resigned, should have used common sense, it’s possible he was just not properly trained.

Sadly, common sense is not common to everyone. Nevertheless, if he had been given the tools to police his community effectively, this man would still have a job, the girl (and her family) might still respect law enforcement, and, ultimately, this little drama would not have played out and become a part of the long list of ugly exchanges between officers and black citizens.

Citizens should also concentrate on how to converse with law enforcement, even when disagreements arise. Cooperation and communication will lead to a better view of them overall. Additionally, don’t believe that every single African American has had or will have a negative and racist encounter with a police officer.

If you would like some friendly advice, here are some principles to adhere to — regardless of your skin color:

Do not move suddenly when you’re pulled over. Turn off your car and roll down your window. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. When the police officer approaches your vehicle, do not get an attitude. If you have a problem with what he or she is saying, wait for your day in court to argue your case. When they ask for your license and registration, make no sudden movements. Ask if you may retrieve those items before moving. State what you are doing before you do it.

If you have done nothing wrong, you should have nothing to fear. The list above has not led this black driver astray yet.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/05/no-bernie-sanders-police-are-not-out-to-get-black-people/,2019-11-05
"Bloomberg’s Apology For Stop, Question, And Frisk Is Shameful","Ladies and gentlemen, meet woke Michael Bloomberg. The newly minted, almost-candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination is planning to run in the moderate lane, but that didn’t stop him from reversing course on one of the biggest questions of his political career this week, and in the process, throwing his own legacy and the New York City Police Department under the bus. In an act of shameless pandering, the three-term New York mayor apologized for the policing tactic known as “Stop, Question, and Frisk.”

At a church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg made his farcical mea culpa, saying, “I got something important really wrong. I didn’t understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives — but as we know: good intentions aren’t good enough.”

If you look closely at this statement you can see what makes it nonsensical. He was focused on saving lives, God forbid. In 2002 Michael Bloomberg inherited from Rudy Giuliani the most effective police force to ever exist. When Rudy and his police commissioner William Bratton took over in 1994 there were over 2000 homicides in New York. By the time he left that number was more than cut in half.

Those numbers were the result of a revolution in crime fighting known as proactive policing. Central to this success was CompStat, a computerized system that allowed the NYPD to pinpoint where resources were needed to fight violent crime. In most cases, those resources were needed in black and Latino communities where murder rates were vastly higher than in other neighborhoods.

In 2002, when Bloomberg took over as mayor he brought on Ray Kelly to lead the NYPD. A tough-as-nails beat cop and the first person ever to rise from police cadet to police commissioner, Kelly’s tenure lasted until 2013 when the murder rate was almost cut in half again. His signature policy, which intended to and succeeded in keeping illegal guns off the street, was Stop, Question, and Frisk.

The practice of Stop, Question, and Frisk was rooted in the 1968 Supreme Court decision, Terry v Ohio, which allowed police officers without probable cause to arrest, to frisk a suspect they considered to be dangerous. What Kelly, the beat cop, knew was that police in their districts know where the danger is, and need the tools to protect against it. Under Kelly’s reign the risk of carrying an illegal gun in New York City became enormous, and he for one has no doubt that Stop, Question, and Frisk was essential in saving thousands of lives, most of them black and brown.

Not too long ago Michael Bloomberg agreed with that assessment. He was furious when a federal judge found the practice unconstitutional, notwithstanding Terry v Ohio, and even more irate when Bill de Blasio, who took over as mayor in 2014 refused to appeal the decision. Opponents of the practice argue that crime has continued to decrease since it stopped, although troubling indicators are already emerging.

But this argument fails to take into account the fundamental transformation of neighborhoods that Kelly’s police force undertook. It’s like looking at a drug addict who is five years sober and saying, “see, she’s still sober, rehab had nothing to do with it.” If Bloomberg had simply taken the position that Stop, Question, and Frisk is no longer needed that would be one thing, but to apologize for it is an insult the police force that helped make his reputation as an effective mayor.

This could not come at a worse time. In New York City today, people are jumping turnstiles en masse to protest police keeping the subway system safe. Officers have had buckets of water thrown on them and their vehicles. Every move the NYPD makes occurs under the gaze of 8 million smart phones and still abuse is rare. But that doesn’t keep the professional Left from smearing New York’s finest as a bunch of racist thugs, despite the fact that the NYPD is a leader in expanding diversity.

For Bloomberg to lend his voice to this slander in a cynical and vain attempt to win the White House is shameful. Michael Bloomberg was not the one patrolling the streets of New York City as the crime rate plummeted, much as he likes to take credit for it. He was not in harms way if criminals were carrying illegal guns, the NYPD were.

Bloomberg’s change of heart is not the result of any new information, its pure politics, plain and simple. And it is an insult to a police force that more than anything else, transformed the world’s greatest city and saved thousands of lives in the process.

The London Terrorist Attack Shows Rehabilitative Justice Doesn’t Work,"The British police force was severely cut under prime ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron, the British version of the liberal-neocon duopoly who, just like their American counterparts, believed in the transformative nature of justice. Transform they did, although not criminals and terrorists. Instead they transformed their countries for worse. The British police force is kneecapped by its own ruling class, the product of its new woke elite, complete with crackpot theories and activist impulses.

The U.K. death penalty was removed due to the liberal empire. Police patrols were de-sexed — mom and dad duos, as some Brits call them. Now U.K. police are represented by a middle-aged, overweight, balding man and a plump woman in comical fluorescent jackets, looking more like road repair workmen than law enforcement officers, standing on street corners looking bored as they do their daily hours. In police stations, woke officers are more interested in checking mean tweets and dancing during LGBT parades than in catching criminals.

Civilians Are Taking the Law Into Their Own Hands

But that’s not all. Even when the specialized police force actually properly works, like this time when it took only five minutes from reporting time to take down a terrorist, it is kneecapped.

Consider this latest case. The terrorist Usman Khan was caught and docked after he planned a mass murder in the London Stock Exchange in 2012. The punishment was hideously lenient, even from the beginning. The total jail sentence was 16 years. Yet halfway through the sentence, he was released by activist judges who, given their enormous wisdom, decided an electronic tag could control this maniac.

Think about that for a moment. A violent and emotionally stunted man, radicalized by an ideology that promises martyrdom for mass murder, was thought to be controllable with only an ankle tag to monitor his movements, by our judges, who live in guarded mansions. Naturally, when this man fled his house, got a giant knife, and started indiscriminately stabbing people on the London Bridge, members of the public were left to stop a terrorist with a fire extinguisher and a pub-door decoration of a Narwhal tusk.

During a similar attack in the same place, another random Londoner took on a knife-wielding terrorist with pub chairs and bare fists. The official London police policy for civilians during a terror attack is to run and hide. It is increasingly clear that Londoners refuse to likewise run and hide. They are also increasingly taking the law into their own hands against street muggers and criminal gangs.

Rehabilitative Justice Doesn’t Work

Almost like clockwork, leftist media started warning against a “knee-jerk” reaction in the wake of the Friday terrorist attack. A war of words broke out between a Conservative minister and her Labour counterpart regarding who was responsible for the early-release legislation, with the Labour MP falling on the side of “rehabilitation.”

That is the crux of the problem. Modern Western law enforcement and academic theories behind it tilt heavily toward rehabilitative justice instead of a classical and orthodox punitive deterrence — almost so much, it verges on utopia. Led by leftist professors and academics with flawed research and biased conclusions, churned out like gospel truth by sympathetic urban liberal journalists, and enforced by law enforcement officers and hyper-liberal activist judges, for more than 40 years our society has been slowly but surely transformed from within.

This applies not only to terrorism, which is numerically at its lowest. The root cause of favoring rehabilitation over deterrence has taken a toll. Every medium of propaganda from mass media, to films, to music, has glamorized crime and criminals, who are always helpless victims of social injustice and structural inequality, just one reform away from being Nelson Mandela.

Case in point, the terror apologizers in the U.K., called CAGE, have systematically blamed all terror attacks on persecution of Muslims. They’re a British version of the Southern Poverty Law Center, if you like.

Criminal Justice Must Be Punitive

This is unsustainable. Chris Phillips, a former head of the U.K. national counterterrorism security office, was quoted in The Guardian, of all places, saying:

The criminal justice system needs to look at itself. We’re letting people out of prison, we’re convicting people for very, very serious offences and then they are releasing them back into society when they are still radicalised. So how on earth can we ever ask our police services and our security services to keep us safe? I’ve said it a few times today, we’re playing Russian roulette with people’s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised Jihadi criminals walk about our streets.

Unfortunately, nothing will change unless heads start rolling. The common people in both the U.K. and the U.S. don’t care about harebrained schemes. Most people want the government to do minimum: govern, provide security and safety, and maintain the public works and streets. Fewer advertisement bans, fewer plastic straw bans, and more severe punishments for habitual offenders.

But our elite classes — from academics, to bleeding-heart nonprofit organizations and politicians, to activist judges — don’t get to feel the pain of their idealistic utopian theories. There is no accountability.

They are not facing the brunt of stupid misadventure in Mesopotamia. They are not getting murdered in random gang violence in the streets of South London, or walking through the diarrhea-, vomit-, blood-, and syringe-filled streets of San Francisco. Like modern versions of Marie-Louise Thérèse of Savoy-Carignan, they are sowing the seeds of populist uprisings.

"Charlotte, NC Uses Social Distancing Rules To Crack Down On Pro-Lifers","On April 4, eight people were arrested by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department for sidewalk counseling and praying in front of an abortion facility. Although most of the pro-life advocates did not come as a group and were spaced more than six feet apart, officers allege they were violating the North Carolina governor’s stay at home order as well as that of Mecklenburg County by participating in a gathering of more than ten people.

The order allows for outdoor activity with social distancing and for volunteering with charitable and social services. This group was doing both of these things, and have thus sued the city over the arrests.

David Benham is the founder of Cities4Life, a pro-life organization. David and his twin brother Jason are former professional baseball players and the founders of Benham Real-estate Group. They are well known for being fired from HGTV for their stances on gay marriage and abortion.

The Benhams have deep ties to the pro-life movement. Their father, Flip Benham, is infamous for converting Norma McCorvey, who was Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade, to Christianity and to the pro-life movement. Flip Benham was also present at the clinic and arrested.

The event is gaining national attention. On Saturday Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posted a video on Twitter of David Benham’s arrest.

Killing Babies Essential, Saving Them Not

In a video posted Sunday evening with his son Bailey Benham, who also got arrested, David Benham said the stay-at-home orders exempt federally recognized public charities that are providing essential services. He said his ministry provides baby shower gifts, partners with pregnancy resource centers to do mobile sonograms, and works with the Department of Social Services for fostering and adoption. “If abortion clinics are essential service, then the pro-life ministry is also an essential service,” he said.

According to a video posted by Cities4Life Director Daniel Parks, soon after he arrived at the abortion facility that morning, police told him that if more than ten people showed up they would be asked to leave, even if those people were not connected to Cities4Life.

Soon after 9 a.m., more people arrived to pray in front of the clinic. Many were connected to a different pro-life organization called Love Life. This ministry posted this announcement to their website.

Jim Quick, a volunteer with Love Life, said the group specifically did not sanction a mass gathering and informed volunteers that if they came to the facility it would be as individuals and not as representatives of Love Life. They have had a notice on their website cancelling group ministry at clinics for the past two weeks, he said.

Dispute Over Number of People Present

Eighteen-year-old Konur Papageorgiou was arrested when he refused to stop praying in front of the abortion facility on Saturday. When he arrived at 9 a.m., there were already at least a dozen police cars parked across the street from the clinic, he told me in a phone call. Papageorgiou said it seemed like the officers were picking and choosing who to cite and arrest at random.

Fox 46 and WBTV reported that 50 people were part of the mass gathering. That is disputed by several eyewitness reports.

Quick said the Latrobe abortion facility sits on a tear drop-shaped loop about a mile and a half long. Papageorgiou said when he was first cited there were only eight to nine other people within view. This included four to five people further down the street, around a corner. He said as he was being driven away in a police car he saw another four to five people even further down the loop.

Frank Moore, who was praying outside of the clinic on Saturday, said he never counted more than 20 people present total and no more than ten in front of the actual clinic. He said when he was approached by officers and told to leave he was the only one on his side of the sidewalk.

Moore said he didn’t believe he was violating social distancing guidelines, as he was wearing a mask and merely walking outside on public property by himself. Iris Robinson, who was also there praying, said she never counted more than ten people in front of the clinic though the amount of officers was “overkill.”

“There were about just as many police officers as there were of us,” Papageorgious said. “I thought it was ironic because we were all spread out but when they arrested and cited us they brought us all into one big group.”

Numerous videos of the morning show that protestors were far more than six feet apart. In an email David Benham said:

When I arrived there were three sidewalk counselors and about 15 officers. I was arrested while standing by myself across the street. By the time I was taken away in the police car there were other individuals that had arrived, but there [were] no gatherings [taking] place and there [were] hundreds of feet of social distance from what I saw.

What the Police Say

According to the mayor’s office and CMPD’s Office of Public Affairs, the officers were acting based on what County Attorney Tyrone Wade wrote:

Under the right circumstances, a government can place reasonable restrictions on constitutional rights. Under these circumstances, while the COVID-19 state of emergency and public health declarations are in place to prevent or reduce the further spread of the virus, it is reasonable to limit a person’s freedom of movement to a gathering of no more than ten people and a requirement that each person remains at least six feet apart in order to protect the public.

I called Wade’s office and left two voicemails, but my calls were not returned. The County Attorney’s Office also did not immediately respond for comment. When asked how the CMPD and county attorney’s office determined how to define a gathering, CMPD did not answer.

Officer Blake Page provided this account of events on behalf of the CMPD Public Affairs Office:

This weekend, CMPD officers were assigned to the women’s clinic on Latrobe Drive. The CMPD has traditionally monitored demonstrations at the clinic for several years to ensure the safety of patients, clinic staff and demonstrators. On Saturday, officers observed approximately fifty protesters congregating outside of the clinic. The gathering was determined to be a violation of mass gatherings in the North Carolina Stay at Home Order. Those who exceeded the ten person limit outlined in the order, were asked to leave. They refused and were subsequently issued citations for that in-person refusal to comply. Several of the individuals cited chose to remain and were arrested for their refusal to disperse.

As far as I know, no one exercising in parks that Saturday was cited for coming to the same place as dozens of others and for the same purpose. Nor were the hundreds of people who visited Home Depot on Saturday cited for coming to the same place for the same purpose.

Both this article and reporting from WBTV shows crowded parks around Charlotte on Saturday. Police can be seen patrolling, but not breaking up any of the crowds. This demonstrates the double standard CMPD is using to enforce stay at home orders. If CMPD applied the governor’s orders without bias and equally, as they claimed to do with the pro-lifers near the abortion facility, they would be citing and arresting hundreds of people in parks and parking lots across the state.

‘Selective Enforcement and Viewpoint Discrimination’

Benham was held in custody for four hours and released without bail. His court date is June 2, and he is being represented by attorneys from the civil-rights legal nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, he said in an email.

“It was selective enforcement, it was viewpoint discrimination,” Benham stated.

In a Facebook live video taken outside of the abortion clinic Saturday morning Cities4Life Volunteer Coordinator Vicky Kaseorg said that even though she and the rest of the group were carefully observing all of the distancing requirements from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, members of the Love Life ministry and the Founder of Cities4Life were arrested.

County Health Director Gibbie Harris stated on Twitter that a local volleyball game violated the county’s stay at home order because the game requires sharing equipment. There is no evidence that police broke up the game. Local radio host Mark Garrison observed that pro-life advocates in front of the Latrobe abortion facility were maintaining social distance requirement when he visited the clinic to conduct interviews on the last two Saturdays, he reported on WBT.

In a livestream Facebook video, Isaiah Feliciano Burner, a local pastor and member of Love Life, filmed all eight arrests and the handing out of several citations, including his own. Burner’s video shows himself and others going out of their way to maintain social distancing guidelines.

Those who received citations were said to be in Violation of Emergency Prohibitions and Restrictions under NCGS 14-288.20A(2). “After an initial request for compliance, 12 people who were in violation refused to leave” and were cited under state law for violation of emergency prohibitions and restrictions, according to CMPD news release.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles could not be reached for comment. I contacted her Joint Information Center and spokesperson numerous times via phone and email and was never given a statement. Gov. Roy Cooper could also not be reached for comment. I contacted his deputy chief of staff via email and did not hear back.

It Shouldn’t Take Lawyers To Get Cities To Back Off Church Service Bans,"The government’s over-restrictive policies in response to COVID-19 shine a light on the unbridled power it has to violate citizens’ constitutional rights under the guise of a state of emergency. Here in the city of Wilmington, North Carolina, the Wilmington Police Department’s statement issued on April 8 declaring “drive-in church services” illegal.

This effectively violated every Wilmington resident’s First and Fourth Amendment rights. Mayor Bill Saffo, who is ultimately responsible for his police department’s actions, has shown a glimpse into the tyrannical power government wields when left unchecked by its citizens.

Our Founding Fathers made adequate assurances that American citizens would be free from the tyranny they faced at the hands of British overlords. When contemplating the foundation of our nation, our forefathers made a top priority to include in the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments outline the enumerated rights each citizen retains and the limits of power the government holds over those rights.

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ensures that the government will make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion or the right to peaceably assemble. The First Amendment originally only applied to the federal government but the Fourteenth Amendment later applied it to state and local government.

Although restricting the right to assemble might be deemed necessary under the circumstances of COVID-19 pandemic, local bans despite parishioners remaining in their vehicles and maintaining social distancing shows the power governments have to make such erroneous interpretations, in direct contradiction to the U.S. Constitution and governors’ executive orders. Effectively, Saffo’s proscription against the freedom to exercise religion safely from the inside of one’s motor vehicle or in the open air directly violated our constitutional rights and the laws of North Carolina.

To further confound the molestation of our God-given constitutional rights, Saffo’s policy would have been enforced by unreasonable government seizures carried out by the hands of our local police. The U.S. Supreme Court held in Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249 (2007) that stopping a car is, in fact, a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes and that, generally, police officers may not make such seizure unless they can articulate at least reasonable suspicion to believe a law has been violated.

Wilmington Police Department announced they would be stopping vehicles based on no such articulable facts. Not only did the department’s interpretation of the executive order contradict the guidance given by Gov. Roy Cooper, it violated citizens’ civil rights under the First Amendment, by specifically targeting their free exercise of religion.

On April 9, 2020, my law partners and I decided we needed to do something about this. We agreed the police department’s interpretation of the executive order was a gross injustice, unconstitutional, and trampled on the rights of the citizens in our city. Later that day we issued a press release outlining the argument I gave above and received mixed feedback, as one would expect.

Our argument was that Cooper’s office had specifically outlined in a letter to the North Carolina Sherriff’s Association that his stay-at-home order did not affect religious activities such as “drive-in church services” on Easter weekend. The mayor and police department in Wilmington went too far in their deliberate misinterpretation of the executive order and directly threatened the core of what makes us all Americans.

Later that evening we were notified that Wilmington Police had issued a statement walking back their stance on enforcing the ban. What does this mean?

I do respect the seriousness of COVID-19 and the burden it has placed on local, state, and federal leaders as they try to navigate these uncharted waters. Doctors, nurses, first responders, and other health-care professionals are seeing the worst the virus has to offer, and for some it seems like there is no end in sight.

However, if our constitutional protections go out the door at the declaration of every emergency, what is the point of having them? Americans should not have to need lawyers to have basic rights upheld, even in times of emergency.

Government should encourage voluntary compliance with the measures of social distancing, self-quarantine, and closing businesses, but ordering businesses to close their doors and parents to educate their kids from a kitchen table, forcing Wilmington residents to stand in line at the food bank and unemployment office, and not allowing citizens to safely worship during Holy Week is evidence of government gone too far.

Three times in my life I swore to support and defend Constitution: when I joined the U.S. Marine Corps, when I reenlisted into a reserve component, and when I was sworn into the state and federal bars of North Carolina. Each time I took that oath, I did so knowing full well the responsibility that comes with it.

Each of us should hold seriously the values that make us American. Standing by while those values are thrown to the wayside is something no citizen should be forced to witness. We must now stand up for our rights and not allow the government to exact its will upon us without any questions, pushback, or arguments.

I think of our founding fathers at this time and, in particular, of the words of Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/14/it-shouldnt-take-lawyers-to-make-nc-city-back-off-drive-in-church-service-ban/,2020-04-14
"Police Shut Down ReOpenNC Protesters, Claim It's 'Non-Essential Activity'","On Tuesday morning, the Raleigh Police Department shut down approximately 100 protesters with the libertarian group #ReOpenNC. The majority of protesters were demonstrating from their cars, abiding by North Carolina’s social distancing guidelines.

The group gathered to protest Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order shutting down the state until further notice. While many governors have given constituents an end date to shelter-in-place orders, Cooper signed North Carolina’s order until he decides to rescind it.

“This Executive Order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until rescinded,” it reads.

The #ReOpenNC protesters claim Cooper’s shelter-in-place order is an unconstitutional overreach that will kill small businesses. The group has a following of approximately 30,000 members and is compromised of many small business owners.

Ashley Smith, the co-founder of #ReOpenNC, told The Federalist she couldn’t sit there and watch small businesses and personal liberties be taken away by a prolonged shelter-in-place order.

“Our rights and our liberties and our lives are just being destroyed right before our very eyes,” Smith said. “None of us are going to stand up and do anything about it? No.”

Smith described the communal aspect of #ReOpenNC and shared stories about friends who had weddings cancelled, mothers dying alone, and one individual who watched a life-long partner die through a small window in a hospital door.

“It feels so personal now,” the mother of four said.

Smith said the group’s co-founders called the Wake Forest Sheriff’s Department and the Raleigh Police Department to ask for permission to protest. She said the group was given permission and told they did not need a permit.

According to Jonah Kaplan at ABC News, the protesters were met by the Raleigh Police Department along with the Wake Forest Sheriff’s prison transport. The majority of protesters demonstrated from their cars to abide by social distancing guidelines. The group honked their horns in unison every 15 minutes.

The Raleigh Police Department warned protesters who exited their cars and eventually those inside their cars. Monica Ussery, 51, was arrested and charged with violating Cooper’s executive order for walking through the parking lot.

Smith described the police garb as “just short of riot gear.”

The police issued three warnings before cars and people started to disperse.

When group members questioned what part of the executive order they weren’t abiding by, the Raleigh police said on Twitter that “protesting is a non-essential activity.”

https://twitter.com/raleighpolice/status/1250111779574894594

“I think [this] is absolutely ridiculous and I think the North Carolina State Constitution says otherwise,” Smith said.

Smith said there has been emotional and political gaslighting towards her efforts to mitigate the quarantine. She explained to The Federalist that her efforts are not to hinder those who are immunocompromised, but to allow companies and individuals to make choices for themselves. Smith also noted the national correlation between suicide rates and unemployment.

“We don’t need a nanny state,” Smith said. “This is what I’ve heard from our collective voice of almost 30,000 members… What they’re saying over and over again is, look I’ve been immunocompromised for years and no one’s ever had to come along and force me to do these things. I know how to protect myself.”

Police Are Using Drones To Enforce Social Distancing In America’s Backyards,"Police departments across the country are resorting to the use of drone surveillance to enforce social distancing in both public and private spaces during statewide shelter-in-place orders.

New footage shot by MSNBC shows police in Elizabeth, New Jersey using drones to look for people not social distancing in areas their patrol cars cannot access.

“The drones make it easier for people to see into certain areas where access by patrol car is more difficult,” Rehema Ellis, an NBC news correspondent said. “That includes tight spaces between buildings, behind schools, and in backyards.”

Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage told MSNBC that cities need to get creative, and defended the intrusive tactic as potentially saving lives.

“If these drones save one life, it is clearly worth the activity and the information the drones are sending,” the mayor said.

Insane. Police are using drones to enforce social distancing by spying on Americans in their backyards. Police chief says invasion of privacy is worth it “if it saves one life.” At a certain point even the most obsequious bootlickers will have had enough pic.twitter.com/9yeWAENjHh — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) April 20, 2020

When a drone identifies a group of people collected together, such as individuals quarantined in their backyard, it says, “you should not be congregating in groups.” Consequences for refusing to abide by the drones in Elizabeth, NJ include a court summons or a $1,000 fine.

In Lewes, Delaware, the police department is using drones to fly over bike trails and beaches. According to a local news station, the Lewes PD Chief said the state may use the drones in the future to enforce out-of-state quarantine protocols. Anyone with an out-of-state license plate would be subject to the drone.

“We haven’t used it to do a car stop of an out-of-state vehicle yet but we may at some point try that. Actually stop the car with the real police officer and fly the drone up near the window to announce the out-of-state quarantine restrictions the governor has put in place,” said Lewes Police Chief Thomas Spell.

The Mayor of Stratford, Connecticut instituted a $100 fine for individuals caught avoiding social distancing guidelines. In other Connecticut cities, police or drones who catch groups in violation of social distancing guidelines use the opportunity to educate and warn citizens. In Stratford, the drones are used to punish citizens who disobey.

“We need to make it understood that we are very serious about enforcing the governor’s executive orders at our public facilities, and those who disobey will be cited,” said Stratford Mayor Laura Hoydick.

A Chinese company known as Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) donated these types of drones to 43 law enforcement agencies in 23 states. Last May, the Department of Homeland Security issued a memo warning that Chinese drones are possible security risks, ripe for the “potential use for terrorism, mass casualty incidents, interference with air traffic, as well as corporate espionage and invasions of privacy.”

After introducing new legislation against buying Chinese-made technology in 2019, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., warned about potential data risks. “The Communist Party of China now has in their law the availability to interfere and take information from virtually every Chinese company,” Warner told NPR. “As long as that exists, that provides a whole set of vulnerabilities I think American business has to consider on a going-forward basis.”

These drones have been distributed in the following 23 states:

Alabama

California

Colorado

Delaware

Florida

Georgia

Illinois

Indiana

Louisiana

Maryland

Michigan

Mississippi

New Jersey

New York

North Carolina

Oklahoma

Oregon

South Carolina

South Dakota

Texas

Virginia

Washington

Wisconsin

Drone invasions on private property clearly violate the 4th Amendment, and no new laws exist to govern the use of surveillance technology by police departments. Police departments across the nation are taking drone usage upon themselves to violate American liberties in the name of social distancing guidelines, even on private property.

"No, We Don’t Need To Foster A Culture Of Snitching To Stay Safe","One of the unsettling trends to emerge from these lockdowns is the penchant for some public officials to encourage snitching on neighbors and businesses that don’t comply with social distancing rules or whatever edict a governor or mayor decides to promulgate on a given day.

This week it was Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who, like many other governors across the country announced a partial reopening of his state as the spread of the coronavirus slows. But Polis wasn’t content simply to announce the new guidelines. He had to lecture Coloradans on their behavior and warn them he might yank the reopening if they don’t behave.

“If we slack off, if Coloradans let up, if less people are wearing masks when they are in public, if stores aren’t being careful and personal services aren’t being careful about following the guidelines that we put out today, then it’s likely that additional restrictions might have to come back,” he said.

For one thing, Polis shouldn’t be obsessing over what safety measures business owners put in place—they’re not children, they can figure it out—he should be watching hospitalizations and COVID-19 fatalities. Remember that the entire purpose of lockdowns and social distancing wasn’t to stop the spread of the virus but to slow it down so hospitals wouldn’t be overwhelmed.

That’s the metric that matters, and Polis, like other officials lately, is subtly trying to move the goalposts. (In a guest op-ed for the Denver Post, he suggested his social distancing orders might have to remain in place until there’s a cure or a vaccine, which “could take months, even years.”)

But Polis went one step further and said people should report businesses that aren’t doing what local public health officials and the Colorado attorney general say they should do. “We know that the people of Colorado will tell us if there’s a store that’s not implementing social distancing.”

This isn’t just infantilizing and un-American, it’s insulting to businesses that are trying to weather an unprecedented economic crisis, and it’s insulting to the tens of millions of American who have become unemployed thanks to government-enforced lockdowns.

Polis isn’t alone in his fondness for snitching. New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio, who recently issued a disturbing warning to the city’s Jewish community that they’d better not gather in large groups or he’d have them rounded up, set up a 311 “snitch line” earlier this month so neighbors could inform on one another. It didn’t go well.

The idea was to have New Yorkers “snap a photo” of businesses that weren’t social distancing. Instead, trolls flooded the line with dick pics and Hitler memes, so the city shut it down.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti made headlines in early April when he said “snitches get rewards”—his awkward, unfunny play on “snitches get stitches.” To the snitches, he said, “We want to thank you for turning folks in and making sure we are all safe.”

Do We Really Want to Call the Police On Each Other?

The problem with this attitude from elected leaders is that it trickles down to law enforcement authorities, who get it into their heads that every order that issues forth from a mayor or governor, however unconstitutional, unenforceable, or outrageous, must be legal and therefore must be imposed on the public.

That’s how you get scenes like the one that played out in Wisconsin recently, in which the police came to a woman’s home and told her to stop letting her daughter play at a neighbor’s house because the governor said so. Note that the woman refuses to give the officers her last name, asking them to cite what law she’s broken. They can’t, and eventually they just leave.

https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/1255558851107139595?s=20

This is also how you get police officers in Laredo, Texas, going undercover to arrest two women last week for the crime of operating a home beauty business. How did the cops find out about these criminals? An anonymous tip.

Thankfully, not all law enforcement agencies are so eager to harass their fellow citizens. In Houston, Texas, a county commissioner tried to promulgate an order that everyone must wear a facemask or face a $1,000 fine—never mind the insult of imposing thousand-dollar fines during an economic downturn and mass unemployment—but the Harris County police refused to enforce it. Instead of handing out tickets to people without masks, they handed out masks.

But what’s astonishing about the Houston case, and all the others over the past month, is that the elected officials in question have been actively seeking to get the police involved where they’re not needed. Encouraging people to rat on their neighbors (instead of, I don’t know, talking to them politely?) encourages a police response, which means an implicit threat of violence and the possibility that things might go terribly wrong.

‘The People Are Primarily Responsible For Their Safety’

Look, I get it, social distancing and stay-at-home orders are important and we should all try our best, within reason, to follow them. But the facts are what they are: stay-at-home orders haven’t had much effect on outcomes so far. As Jordan Schachtel noted recently on Twitter, the handful of states that never issued stay-at-home orders have fared better than those that have.

Partly that’s because the states that didn’t issue orders have fewer big cities and more rural, dispersed populations. But they are all dealing with coronavirus cases, including some fatalities. The difference is, leaders in those states made a decision to trust the common sense of the people about how to protect themselves and their families.

As South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem put in at a press conference this week announcing her “Back to Normal” plan, “Ultimately it is the people themselves that are primarily responsible for their safety. They are the ones who are entrusted expansive freedoms. They are free to exercise their rights to work, worship, and to play or to stay at home and to conduct social distancing.”

South Dakota never issued any lockdowns or stay-at-home orders and has fared just fine, which goes to show that Americans don’t need the police lurking around our front porches or chasing down lone runners on the beach for most people to be smart and do the right thing. What we definitely don’t need right now, with tens of millions struggling to provide for their families and cope with a pandemic amid rising tensions, is more snitches.

Ahmaud Arbery’s Killers Get Due Process After Stealing It From Him,"Ahmaud Arbery would have been celebrating his 26th birthday today, May 8. But he was murdered. The black Georgia man was out for a jog on the afternoon of Feb. 23 when two white men, who allegedly thought Ahmaud was a burglar, chased him down and brutally shot and killed him. The entirety of the horrific shooting was caught on camera. Take caution before watching the video. It is truly horrifying.

The disturbing cell phone footage was leaked online this past week, causing a justified frenzy of outrage over the 21st-century lynching. Coincidentally — or not — the arrest was made just days after the leaked video caused public fury. Father and son duo Gregory and Travis McMichael were charged on May 7 with murdering and assaulting Ahmaud — over two months after the killing. And this is despite the fact that unlike the family of Ahmaud, police have had access to the video since the day of the incident. If the video hadn’t been leaked, there’s no telling when and if an arrest would have ever been made.

The Truth Comes Out

The footage begins by showing Ahmaud leisurely jogging through a neighborhood in shorts and a T-shirt in Brunswick, Georgia. Any viewer can clearly see he was in no way “hauling ass” down the street, as Gregory described to police. Gregory claimed he was at home when he saw Ahmaud run by, which prompted him to alert his son Travis to grab their guns and hop in a truck with William “Roddy” Bryan to chase after Ahmaud and save the day.

The McMichaels claimed that once they caught up to Ahmaud, they yelled for him to stop, but he kept running — as if somehow, this verbal command from a fellow citizen justified the following action. The McMichaels told police they tried to block his path forward, but Ahmaud ran in the opposite direction, as anyone would likely do if a truck full of armed men chased them down. Once they pulled up to him again, Travis jumped out of the truck to confront Ahmaud.

Gregory, Travis’ father, claimed Ahmaud began violently attacking Travis, who responded by shooting him with his shotgun, but the video contradicts this narrative. It appears as though Ahmaud is simply running around the truck toward Travis, perhaps trying to grab his gun. As soon as they appear to be close enough to make physical contact, a shot is immediately fired. Then two more quickly followed. Ahmaud stumbled to his death shortly after. The official police incident report documents only two shots despite the fact there were clearly three.

Glynn County Police Department, the law enforcement that responded to the scene and wrote the incident report, is also Gregory’s former employer. The former cop retired last May, but also worked as an investigator for the office of local District Attorney Jackie Johnson, causing plenty of conflicts of interest. Johnson recused herself from prosecuting the case, as did the next assigned prosecutor, George Barnhill, whose son worked for Johnson. But not without brazen retort.

In his recusal letter, Barnhill accused Ahmaud’s mother of making “unfounded allegations of bias” and said there is no conflict of interest. However, a work relationship between a prosecutor’s son and a possible suspect is legitimately concerning, making Barnhill’s argument odd. Barnhill then proceeded to defend the McMichaels, which is completely uncalled for. He boldly alleged the McMichaels had “solid firsthand probable cause” to go after Ahmaud and assumed that “their intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived,” which is “perfectly legal.” He went even further to point out that the guns were legal, and in his view, the McMichaels should not be arrested.

Barnhill’s response is quite shocking, especially because it’s an opinion in support of the McMichaels, alongside an argument claiming he’s unbiased, all within a recusal letter. It wasn’t up to him, however. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation disagreed with Barnhill when they arrested and charged the McMichaels.

McMichaels Will Get Due Process Ahmaud Arbery Didn’t

In the court of public opinion, it appears the McMichaels are guilty, and evidence points toward racial bias. White men certainly don’t have to fear for their lives when they leave their house for a run, to put it simply. But the McMichaels will be afforded the right of due process in the criminal justice system to determine their fate, a right they stole from Ahmaud.

Regardless of a conviction or not, one should consider: What reasonable person decides to chase down, with a loaded gun, another human who they merely suspect of wrongdoing? Gregory McMichael and his cohorts might have thought they were playing a heroic role in getting a “bad guy” off the streets, but they instead robbed an innocent man of his right to life, justice, and due process.

Some, like Barnhill, may argue the McMichaels were justified because Ahmaud might have been breaking into people’s homes, but it doesn’t matter. That wasn’t proved by any means at the time of his death, and no matter what the truth is, they had no right to gun him down in the street because he was a black man on a run.

Gregory may have temporarily forgotten, but he was no longer an armed police officer at the time of the incident. He didn’t have a valiant duty of protecting and serving, like he once did before retirement. If he was truly concerned about the safety and wellbeing of his neighbors from the potential threat this black jogger imposed, he should have called police, which is the typical response to supposed danger, and could have merely followed Ahmaud in his truck to help the police find him and monitor activity from a peaceful distance.

Instead, he made a terrible decision to confront Ahmaud himself, armed and ready for violence, which led to the fateful end of Ahmaud’s life.

People are faced with difficult decisions every day. A person’s choice paired with freedom to act is something powerful beyond measure. It was one man’s decision that led to Ahmaud’s death. One different choice — perhaps a call to police or a peaceful observance — could have preserved Ahmaud’s life and justice.

However, there is no turning the clock back now. Ahmaud lost his life, and the world will remember his name. It is paramount that we never stop fighting racism and injustice in the criminal system. If we don’t, the awaiting outcome is more cases like Ahmaud’s.

How To Help Roll Back The Coronavirus Police State,"Last week, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy released a three-minute video in which he vigorously ranted against the ongoing lockdowns. Portnoy’s basic point was that the goalposts have shifted from “flatten the curve” to “find a cure.” He pointed out, in blunt and colorful language, that economic suicide in pursuit of the latter goal is insanity. His video went viral.

Portnoy is not a political figure. His anger over the economic crisis and sense that, having done our best to slow the spread, we have the right to take a risk to survive, resonates with a lot of normal people.

One of Portnoy’s repeated questions throughout the video was, “When did this happen?” When did we go from flattening the curve to tanking our economy, our livelihoods, and our futures? (Language warning in the video below.)

Last night on Tucker Carlson, Andrew Napolitano offered a related reflection when he described a free state as “one where the laws are written to uphold personal liberties,” while the definition of a police state is “one where the laws are written, legitimately or not, to uphold what the government wants.” He went on to note that there has been a transition in America that has not been gradual: “In a period of six weeks we have gone from a free state . . . to a police state.”

Alarming as it is, Napolitano is right. While COVID-19 is an obviously serious and frightening virus, our leaders (and many fellow Americans) seem oblivious to the destruction we are self-inflicting on our economy and on millions of American lives.

The bureaucrats and local would-be dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent. So how did we get here, and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive?

We got here because, as a nation, we agreed to the lockdowns in the first place. In late March and early April, as the virus was spreading in densely populated American cities and horror stories were pouring out of Lombardy, Italy, the mood among Americans shifted. Lockdowns started in coastal states where the threat felt most immediate, and swept the nation shortly thereafter.

The lockdowns happened because the national mood favored the lockdowns. Politicians knew they could call on their emergency powers and impose the restrictions because they would not meet resistance. Collectively, we consented.

Do not underestimate the power of a national mood. Wars have been won and lost based not on the military might of a nation so much as the will of its people to either prevail or to fold.

Nowhere is the spirit of a people more a force to be reckoned with than in America, where freedom and individual autonomy are part of our DNA. This invisible force is a very real influence in politics, and many constitutional abuses have never been attempted over the years, not because they were unconstitutional, but because politicians and leaders understood the actions would not be tolerated. In some sense, we are free because we choose to be free.

We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them—economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission. So how do we muscle out of our bind? How do we return from the police state we have become to the land of liberty that we enjoyed a mere three months ago?

One answer is certainly that we must enforce our constitutional rights by challenging the myriad overreaches in court. That is a critically important effort and just the type of pushback I have applauded for many weeks now. But, in tandem to that effort, and really prior to it, we have to shift the mood again.

Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit, but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood. When people honestly express to others their opposition to continued lockdowns, the sentiment spreads and the “mood” strengthens.

Portnoy’s video went viral not just because he is a popular guy; it went viral because it gave voice to people who weren’t sure their gut reactions were “acceptable” and to people who felt encouraged by seeing someone with whom they identified step up and voice opposition.

We all need to step up and speak out. Everyone has a zone of influence, large or small, and when you speak, you add to a critical growing momentum.

We lose freedom ultimately because we let bad people take it from us. Freedom is not taken by force only; it is often taken slowly and quietly, with our foolish consent that is given by silence.

America was not founded to be a police or nanny state. It flourished because it was the land of the free and the home of the brave. It grew to greatness because people were willing to take risks to survive and succeed.

The will of the American people is not just a political platitude, it is a tangible and powerful force for freedom when properly activated. If we want to roll back the abuses—if we want to break the police state and reclaim our livelihoods, futures, and political autonomy—we all have to affirmatively contribute to a new national mood.

Wuhan Flu Lockdowns Are Teaching Local Police To Manhandle Citizens,"Times of crisis show us the underlying character of those involved. We see it in our politicians, scrambling for face time with major networks, or signing into existence sweeping emergency powers.

The constitutional mettle of the coronavirus-era power grabs will be a well-worn case study in the decades to come. For the average American, the actual intrusion of government—especially law enforcement—power over the last two months has exceeded anything related to even the PATRIOT Act. The orders given to police by state and local officials, and the often rigid enforcement of them, have moved perceptions of not only the lockdowns but also of the commitment to average citizens.

It’s not just police agencies becoming drunk with power—municipal officials are doing the same. Los Angeles is cutting off power and water to “non-essential” businesses that stay open during the stay at home orders.

However, many of the most blatant examples of petty tyranny come to us via law enforcement. The militarization of police departments, coupled with COVID fears, risk a de facto violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of military tactics to enforce domestic laws. Training and equipment acquired through millions in federal and state funding, under the guise of fighting drugs or terrorism, are now being used in a war against Americans’ constitutional rights.

Even if the means justify the ends, the use of armored police with black rifles to enforce a “suspension” of rights is nearly unprecedented and goes well beyond the original promise to “bend the curve.” The most glaring example came last week, when a West Odessa, Texas restaurant opened its doors and the Ector County Sheriff’s Department responded by raiding the restaurant with its SWAT team. Even worse, the officers utilized an MRAP armored vehicle, of Iraq War fame.

Such incidents are not isolated, and they often fly in direct contradiction to the First Amendment. Take, for example, eight pro-life protesters getting arrested for violating stay-at-home orders in North Carolina. Or a paddle boarder getting arrested for taking to the ocean in California.

Or worshippers at a drive-in church service being handed $500 citations in Mississippi. Or a bystander getting tackled to the ground and arrested by a plainclothes New York Police Department officer while witnessing an arrest. Or a father being handcuffed for playing ball with his daughter in a Colorado park. Or the NYPD detaining a mother after her daughter was seen not wearing a mask on the subway.

At the same time, some jurisdictions are using the crisis as a means of fostering lawlessness. A multitude of criminals have been released due to fears that they could contract the virus in the close confines of prison—16,000 in all. And with most court proceedings on hiatus, there is precious little that officers and prosecutors can do to act against serious crime.

The effects have been dire. In Colorado, an inmate serving for felony robbery was released, only to allegedly murder a woman two weeks later. More than 100 inmates from New York City’s Rikers prison have already been re-arrested, driving a 43 percent surge in burglaries in the city in April. The shift from punishing serious crime towards freedom of movement violations has created substantial strain on law enforcement, which is manifesting in different ways.

Even within its ranks, police departments are punishing dissent. Perhaps the most famous example is of Greg Anderson, an officer of the Port of Seattle. His viral video calling restrictions unconstitutional led to the department placing him on leave. Not far away, Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney faces a recall challenge for declaring on Facebook that he will not enforce Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home order.

There is some hope that the federal government may step in to stop many of the worst excesses. In the North Carolina pro-life arrests, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke out against the chilling of the protesters’ First Amendment rights. In the Mississippi example, the Justice Department took the side of the church-goers. Even Attorney General Bill Barr stated that current stay-at-home orders are veering perilously close to “house arrest.”

However, the feds still pump tens of millions annually into police equipment funding—and not just for cruisers and Glocks, but also for surplus military equipment and training to transform Barney Fife into someone far less friendly and far less constitutionally sound.

Law enforcement deserves our respect. This includes the dignity afforded by disagreeing with heavy-handed policies intended more to enforce the letter of executive orders (not even the law), rather than the spirit behind them.

As long as many states flirt with the idea of a post-Bill of Rights future, the same officers we depend on now to keep the peace have a distinct choice. Their oaths include fidelity to their instructions, but far more importantly a pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution.

Our system of laws prohibits Reserve Powers for a reason. Even during a crisis, many officers and police departments will soon find that there is no moral or legal defense behind simply “following orders.”

Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani On Riots: ‘Progressives Don’t Know How To Police’,"Former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani slammed the death of George Floyd on Fox News as an “outrage,” suggesting that police departments can both prevent incidents like Floyd’s killing and better respond to violent riots by having high-ranking officers present.

“Superior officers should have been on the scene when Mr. Floyd was killed,” Giuliani, whose tenure as NYC mayor from 1994 to 2001 earned him the nickname “America’s Mayor,” told Fox News Saturday night. “It probably wouldn’t have happened.”

Giuliani criticized not only Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd by kneeling on his neck and is now being charged with third-degree murder, but also the entire Minneapolis police department and the three officers who stood by while Floyd was killed. “It’s the fault of the police that this happened,” he said. “Not just for one officer — that’s a poorly trained police department.”

But Giuliani also cited the same lack of leadership in many cities’ responses to the ensuing riots and looting. Pointing to the presence of law enforcement officers dressed in white uniforms responding to riots in New York City, he explained that “those police officers in white shirts…those are lieutenants, captains and above.”

Those supervising officers are “there to watch the other police officers,” Giuliani added, suggesting that other cities dealing with riots should follow suit. “I’m sorry to get political — cities run by progressives don’t know how to police,” he said. “Thirty cities went up last night, I went and looked at every one of them. Every one of them has a progressive Democratic mayor.”

In Giuliani’s home city of New York, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea noted that thousands of police officers were sent to respond to the riots, and arrested hundreds of protesters. Fox News reported that the riots “destroyed, defaced or broken into” almost two dozen storefronts.

Despite the widespread violence sweeping the city, current NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted last night around 11:30 p.m. that there was “limited protest activity.”

Just checked on Union Square. At this moment, limited protest activity — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) June 1, 2020

De Blasio’s own daughter Chiara, 25, was arrested the night before in conjunction with the riots.

“This would not have happened when I was mayor of New York City,” Giuliani added. “This is not a protest for Mr. Floyd. This is a desecration of Mr. Floyd’s memory.”

Media Falsely Claimed Violent Riots Were Peaceful And That Tear Gas Was Used Against Rioters,"Following days of violent riots and looting in cities across the country, Washington, D.C., announced a 7 p.m. curfew on Monday night. About the same time, President Donald Trump addressed the nation from the Rose Garden. Afterward, he walked through Lafayette Park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, which rioters had set on fire the night before. Standing before the church sign, which reads “All are welcome,” President Trump, who previously said he’d be paying his respects to a very special place, held up a Bible.

The speech announcing the country would return to rule of law and protection of civil liberties, the walk through a park that the night before had been given over to rioters, and the visit to the vandalized historic church where every president has worshiped since James Madison, were reassuring to many in the country.

For the media, however, these actions were further proof that Orange Man Bad is literally the worst, restoring rule of law is criminal, and standing in front of a church holding a Bible is an assault on the American conscience. They focused on how the Park Police had cleared the area ahead of the city-wide curfew declared by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.

Facts were no barrier to their narrative. They spun a tale of violent, jack-booted cops running rampant through the streets over innocent docile protesters, using tear gas to clear the area. It turns out none of that was true.

Every single major media outlet falsely reported that Park Police were unprovoked when they used “tear gas” to clear the area. If any of that were true, it might mark the first time in history that cops without gas masks launched tear gas in an area that the president of the United States easily walked through minutes later.

After thousands of false tweets, print stories, and broadcast stories to the contrary, local journalist Neal Augenstein of WTOP reported that a Park Police source said “tear gas was never used — instead smoke canisters were deployed, which don’t have an uncomfortable irritant in them.” Further, the source said the crowd was dispersed because of projectiles being thrown by the “peaceful protesters” at the Park Police and because “peaceful protesters” had climbed on top of a structure in Lafayette Park that had been burned the prior night.

Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, the public information officer for the Park Police, confirmed the agency did not use tear gas. And later this afternoon, United States Park Police acting Chief Gregory T. Monahan exploded the entire false narrative:

On Monday, June 1, the USPP worked with the United States Secret Service to have temporary fencing installed inside Lafayette Park. At approximately 6:33 pm, violent protestors on H Street NW began throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids. The protestors also climbed onto a historic building at the north end of Lafayette Park that was destroyed by arson days prior. Intelligence had revealed calls for violence against the police, and officers found caches of glass bottles, baseball bats and metal poles hidden along the street.



To curtail the violence that was underway, the USPP, following established policy, issued three warnings over a loudspeaker to alert demonstrators on H Street to evacuate the area. Horse mounted patrol, Civil Disturbance Units and additional personnel were used to clear the area. As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park. Subsequently, the fence was installed.

Prior to getting the actual facts, nearly every major media outlet falsely reported that canisters of tear gas, not smoke canisters, were used against peaceful protesters. The false story spread internationally despite its lack of evidence. Here are just a few of the uncountable examples.

Reuters published a video it claimed showed U.S. Park Police using tear gas. The video did not show any such thing.

A Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter tweeted out an NPR piece headlined “Park Police Tear Gas Peaceful Protesters To Clear Way For Trump Church Photo-Op.”

PBS’s Yamiche Alcindor reported erroneously that she was “still processing that I saw peaceful protesters teargassed outside the White House so Pres Trump could walk to St. John’s Episcopal Church.”

The Washington Post ran an article falsely headlined, “Inside the push to tear-gas protesters ahead of a Trump photo op,” authored by Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, and Rebecca Tan. Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson claimed Tan “was tear-gassed in reporting this story.” Gender and family issues reporter Samantha Schmidt retweeted that claim, adding, “There were five of us Post reporters — all young women — near Lafayette Square when federal officers started spraying gas and rubber bullets.”

The New York Times falsely headlined its article, “Tear Gas Clears Path for Trump to Visit Church.” An accompanying video showing the result of smoke canisters was falsely headlined:

“His walk came after riot police and National Guard troops used tear gas and flash grenades to clear a path through a peaceful protest in a city park,” the New York Times falsely reported about both the use of tear gas and whether the protests were peaceful. They were not.

In response to Augenstein, Garrett Haake claimed, “Tear gas was definitely used, and park police can’t 🤷🏼‍♂️that.” Asked what made him sure about his claim, he cited his “experience. the burning sensation it caused in my lungs, & my retired marine security.”

Here is a video of the effects of actual tear gas used in training.

MSNBC falsely reported, “Trump Visits Church After Police Clear Protesters With Tear Gas.”

ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos reported the doubly false “Police use tear gas, push back peaceful protesters for Trump church visit.”

The Washington Post’s dramatic Philip Rucker falsely claimed in a tweet that “Military police fire tear gas at peaceful protesters to clear street in front of St. John’s.”

Peter Baker of the New York Times falsely reported on the security threats and how they were removed, saying, “police and troops have moved against peaceful protesters with tear gas and flash bangs.”

Here the New York Times falsely claimed the protesters were peaceful and that tear gas was used against them:

Brett LoGiurato, the senior editor of Wharton Press peddled the tear gas lie and instructed his political allies to censor the news:

Maggie Haberman of the New York Times also peddled the lies about tear gas and peaceful protesters:

NPR hit a trifecta by falsely reporting about tear gas, falsely reporting about peaceful protesting, and as a bonus downplaying the arson against the church:

Religion News Service’s Jack Jenkins got the story wrong.

The Daily Beast/CNN’s Jackie Kucinich also falsely reported about peaceful protests and tear gas. She wrote, “This was a peaceful protest. And they are using tear gas. In the United States. In front of the White House. They tear gassed peacefully protesting and shot rubber bullets at people so President Trump could walk across the park to St. Johns on television. Correction …he had protesters tear gassed to walk to St. Johns, hold up a Bible in front of the church, usher in advisors for the photo-op. And then … walk home.” Whatever the previous sentences of fact-free emoting are, they’re not journalism.

Jonathan Swan of Axios claimed an anonymous “senior White House official told Axios that when they saw the tear gas clearing the crowd for Trump to walk to the church with his entourage: ‘I’ve never been more ashamed. I’m really honestly disgusted. I’m sick to my stomach. And they’re all celebrating it. They’re very very proud of themselves.’” To state the obvious: this source seems extremely poorly informed and not worth granting anonymity to.

Former Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Fox News contributor Jonah Goldberg both fell for and used the false reporting as a means of critiquing former Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin for complimenting Trump’s visit to St. John’s. Former Obama ambassador Michael McFaul, who has repeatedly spread false stories related to the Russia collusion hoax, also fell for this story.

The entire narrative the media glommed onto in lockstep was that Trump was a monster who tear-gassed peaceful protesters to do something meaningless. None of that was true. But it took a day of reporting to get the truth out, long after the lie took hold.

At times it seems as if there is nothing that many in the media won’t lie about to accomplish their political goals.

In related news, despite or perhaps because of the media hysteria, polls show overwhelming majorities of Americans support the use of the National Guard and the military to bring peace to the cities the media claim aren’t being targeted by violent riots.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/02/media-falsely-claimed-violent-riots-were-peaceful-and-that-tear-gas-was-used-against-rioters/,2020-06-02
Tucker Carlson: This Is How Nations Collapse,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson delivered a 30 minute address Monday night, documenting the terror and destruction across the the country, and calling out both the Left and the Right for their their lack of leadership. Watch Carlson’s monologue here, or read the transcript below.

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

“The nation went up in flames this weekend. No one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered. They cowered. They openly sided with the destroyers. In many cases, they egged them on.

Later, they will deny doing any of this. They are denying it now. But you know the truth because you saw it happen.

This is how nations collapse. When no one in authority keeps the order, and when someone in our professional class encourage violence, American citizens are forced to defend themselves. They have no choice. No one else is going to defend them — they know that now.

It’s possible that more people will be hurt in coming days — that would be a tragedy. But in an environment like this, more violence could very well lead to a cascade of new tragedies, to something far bigger and more destructive than anything we have seen so far.

So, this isn’t over. It might simply be the beginning. We pray it isn’t.

It’s hard to think clearly about anything that’s going on right now. The chaos, the destruction, the relentless lying from above — it’s all too much. Americans are bewildered, and they are afraid. But most of all, they are filled with rage, angrier than they have ever been.

The worst people in our society have taken control. They did nothing to build this country. Now, they are tearing it down. They are rushing us toward mass suicide.

So, how do we respond? We must protect ourselves and our families. Once again, we have no choice, but to do that. But we cannot allow ourselves to become like they are.

We are not animals, we are Americans. In the face of such indecency, we must resolve to be decent. We believe this country has a future. We intend for our children to live and thrive here. That is what we are defending.

All our leaders do is set us against each other. They stage a never-ending national cockfight for their profit and amusement.

But we’re not going to play along. We will love our neighbors relentlessly in spite of all of it, not because they look like us or share our political views. But we love them because they are human beings, and they are Americans. Those are the bonds that tie us together — the bonds our leaders seek to destroy. We can’t let them.

We should start by being unsparingly honest about what is happening right now. Truth is our defense, and it’s our country’s last hope.

We plan to use this hour to create a record of this moment right now, to show you what’s really going on in your country. We feel an obligation to do that before the facts are spun into propaganda by the liars or the images are pulled off the internet forever, as many of them inevitably will be.

We’re going to begin with where my family lives and has lived for 35 years, in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. This is called Mac Market. It’s on MacArthur Boulevard, which is named after General MacArthur during the war. It’s our neighborhood store; it’s walking distance from my house.

People meet there every morning for coffee. Kids come after school for candy. It’s as close to a community gathering spot as we have.

The market is run by the Kim family. The Kims are immigrants from Korea. They are revered in our neighborhood for their decency and their hard work. When they lost their son several years ago, the neighbors grieved for them.

The Kims are not political. They’ve never hurt anyone. They only make things better. But last night, the mob came for their store. At 1:00 a.m. Monday morning, Mr. Kim was kneeling alone on the sidewalk trying to salvage what he has spent his life building.

Scenes like this played out in hundreds of neighborhoods across this country, maybe yours.

Here are a few. In Columbia, S.C., a man called the police when things began to fall apart. Rioters saw him call. They surrounded that man, and they beat him. Onlookers laughed as he was pummeled.

In Rochester, N.Y., a group of eight men smashed the windows of a jewelry store. The couple who lived above the shop emerged to confront them. Both of them were viciously beaten with a ladder and a two-by-four.

In Dallas, a man armed with what appeared to be a sword did his best to defend a business from looters. The mob bashed him in the head with a rock and a skateboard. It’s hard to watch.

In San Jose, riders with crowbar stormed the highway and attacked vehicles, trying to pull drivers from their cars. In Birmingham, Ala., a local reporter called Stephen Quinn was beaten, and then he was robbed on live television as he tried to cover the looting.

In Portland, Ore., a man was beaten apparently for daring to carry an American flag in public. He never released the flag, by the way.

How many of these people died? How many were murdered by the rioters? We don’t know yet. At the least, some are likely disabled for life. They were beaten that badly.

And then there was the mass stealing. It seemed to be everywhere over the weekend.

In Buckhead, an upscale part of Atlanta, rioters stole a Tesla from a dealership and drove it through an indoor mall just to underscore how completely out of control things were. In Portland, Oregon, mobs looted Louis Vuitton, Apple and Chase Bank among many others. They often set fires as they left. In Chicago, protesters fought systemic racism by running through a Nike store stealing shoes.

And in Washington, D.C., a federal city surrounded by military bases and protected at all times by the single highest concentration of law enforcement in the world, criminals operated with apparent impunity in the streets. They looted Georgetown. They smashed the windows in federal buildings. They desecrated virtually every war memorial in the city a week after Memorial Day.

And then, as you likely know, Sunday night they set fire to St. John’s Episcopal Church, a 200-year-old building that has welcomed every American president since James Madison. It is right across the street from the White House.

For people stuck inside anywhere during this insanity — the sick, the elderly, the powerless — the experience was terrifying. Listen to this woman from Minneapolis.

Reporter: How was last night?

Unidentified woman: Scary. They went straight to Office Max, the Dollar Store and every store over here that I go to. I have nowhere to go now. I have no way to get there because the buses aren’t running.

So, that’s what’s happening in America right now. We didn’t play all of the tape we have. There’s a lot of it. Some of the tape is too shocking, and honestly, it’s too incendiary. We understand that television is an emotional medium, and we don’t want to make things worse. We’re not going to, but you get the point.

The point is, this is a national emergency. It’s a profound national emergency. But you would never know that from listening to our elected leaders. Almost all of them pretend this is not really happening or if it is happening, it is just part of America’s long tradition of vigorous political discourse.

Politicians on both sides tell us that this is all about the death of a man in police custody in Minneapolis last week. The people burning down our country are “protesters”. They’re engaged in a legitimate “protest.”

Okay, what exactly are those protesters’ demands? What are they asking for? If Congress agreed to enact their program, what would the program be?

Not a single person even hints the answer because there is not an answer. No one has bothered to pull the guys beating up old ladies on the street or looting Gucci, but you’ve got to wonder how many of them have ever even heard of George Floyd. And if they have heard of him, what difference would it make? Violence and looting are not forms of political expression.

If you were killed tomorrow, how many buildings would you want burned to the ground in your memory? How many old women smashed in the face on the street in your name? None, we hope, because you’re not a vicious psychopath, like the people you’ve just watched.

In fact, what we’re watching is not a political protest. It’s the opposite of a political protest. It is an attack on the idea of politics. The rioters you have seen are trying to topple our political system.

That system is how we resolve our differences without using violence. But these people want a new system, one that is governed by force. Do what we say or we will hurt you.

You know this. You can see it for yourself on television; you have. But our leaders continue to lie. They tell us that’s not true. This isn’t happening. It’s just a protest.

Some Democrats have openly embraced what is happening. Really they don’t have much of a choice. These are their voters cleaning out the Rolex store. These riots effectively are the largest Joe Biden for President rally on record.

In gratitude for that, more than a dozen Joe Biden for President campaign staffers donated money to the rioters in Minneapolis, and then they bragged about it on Twitter.

No Democratic leader can directly criticize what is happening right now. And in fact, some have joined in. Over the weekend, the Democratic Party of Fairfax, Virginia, which is an important Democratic organization, released the following statement on Twitter: “Riots are an integral part of this country’s march towards progress.”

Progress. Burning buildings, teargas, dead bodies, the screaming injured, criminal anarchy — to the Democratic Party of Fairfax, that is called progress.

Celebrity after celebrity has weighed in to agree on social media. From his fortified compound, basketball star LeBron James has used his accounts to encourage more rioting. Bernie Sanders surrogate Shaun King has done the same. So has Black Lives Matter leader, DeRay Mckesson.

Colin Kaepernick openly calls for violence. Here’s a quote: “The cries for peace will rain down and when they do, they will land on deaf ears,” he says approvingly.

Imagine shouting fire in a crowded theater, a theater with 325 million people in it called our country. That’s what they’ve been doing and have been doing for days.

When the violence began, what we needed more than anything was clarity in the middle of this. It’s hard to see when the tear gas starts. Someone in America needed to tell the truth to the country. Instead, almost all of our so-called conservative leaders joined the left’s chorus, as if on cue.

On Friday, as American cities were being destroyed by mobs, the vice president United States refused to say anything specific about the riots we were watching on television. Instead, Mike Pence scolded America for its racism.

Carly Fiorina, once a leading Republican presidential candidate tweeted that — and we’re quoting, “It’s white America that now must see the truth, speak the truth and act on the truth.”

Meanwhile, Kay Coles James, who is the president of the Heritage Foundation — that’s the largest conservative think tank in the country. You may have sent them money, hopefully for the last time. Kay Coles James wrote a long scream denouncing America as an irredeemably racist nation: “How many times will protests have to occur?”

Got that? “Have to occur.” Like the rest of us caused this by our sinfulness.

The message from our leaders on the right, as on the left, was unambiguous: Don’t complain. You deserve what’s happening to you.

No one jumped in more forcefully or seemed angrier in America than former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. “Tonight I turned on the news and I am heartbroken,” Haley wrote. “It’s important to understand that the death of George Ford was personal and painful for many. In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.”

But wait a second, you may be wondering, how am I “personally responsible” for the behavior of a Minneapolis police officer? I’ve never even been to Minneapolis, you may think to yourself. And why is some politician telling me I’m required to be upset about it?

Those are all good questions. Nikki Haley did not answer those questions explaining. It is not her strong suit — that would require thinking.

What Nikki Haley does best is moral blackmail. During the 2016 campaign, she compared Donald Trump to the racist mass murderer, Dylann Roof. How is Donald Trump similar to a serial killer? Nikki Haley never explained that. She wasn’t trying to educate anyone.

Her only goal was political advantage. Nikki Haley is exceptionally good at getting what she wants. She is happy to denounce you as a racist in order to get it. She just did.

In this case, Nikki Haley’s wish came true. The riots were indeed “personal and painful” for everyone. And then the pain kept increasing. Two days after she wrote that, dozens of American cities had been thoroughly trashed, some destroyed.

A country already on the brink of recession suddenly faced economic collapse. An already fearful population locked down for months because of the coronavirus had been thoroughly and completely terrorized.

Mission accomplished. Let’s hope Nikki Haley is pleased. We’ve now atoned.

How did the Trump administration respond to the horrors going on around us? Well, Sunday morning, the country’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, did a live interview from the White House lawn. Here’s how it began:

Robert O’Brien, U.S. National Security Adviser: First thing I want to say, on behalf of the president –he said this to the family — but our hearts and prayers are going out to the Floyd family. We mourn with them and we grieve with them and what happened there was horrific and I can’t even imagine what that poor family is going through as his videos are played over and over again. That should have never happened in America and it’s a tragic thing.

The president said that from the start, and we’re with the family and as the President said, we’re with the peaceful protesters.

“We’re with the peaceful protesters,” O’Brien announced.

Really? Can you be more specific about that? Who are you talking about exactly? Is it the people spitting foam as they scream, “F the police”? Is it the one standing next to the arsonist doing nothing as they set fire to buildings? Is it the kids laughing as they film the looting and the beatings on their iPhones?

Maybe it’s the famous people in L.A. who are raising money online to support the rioters? They’re all just peaceful protesters. Yes, we support that. It’s who we are.

What about the president? Where is he during all of this?

Well, on Friday night, after the show, Leland Vitter and a cameraman headed to Lafayette Square in Washington to cover what was happening outside the White House. Here’s what happened next.

Reporter: A Fox News reporter is getting chased out by these — by the George Floyd protesters here in front of — at Lafayette Park.

Look, there’s water being thrown on the reporter here. This is just — they took his mic. The just threw the mic at the reporter here. As you see guys, things are spiraling here quick at the protest.

That was in Lafayette Square in the center of our capital city. The tape raised a troubling question: If you can’t keep a Fox News correspondent from getting attacked directly across the street from your house, how can you protect my family? How are you going to protect the country? How hard are you trying?

On Twitter the next morning, the president reassured America that he and his family were just fine. The federally funded bodyguards had kept them safe. He did not mention protecting the rest of the nation, much of which was then on fire. He seemed aware only of himself.

For people who like Donald Trump, who voted for Donald Trump, who support his policies, who have defended him for years and years against the most absurd kinds of slander, this was a distressing moment.

The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over the people in your care. That’s what soldiers want from their officers. It’s what families need from their fathers. It’s what voters demand from their presidents.

People will put up with almost anything if you do that. You can regularly say embarrassing things on television. You can hire Omarosa to work at the White House. All of that will be forgiven if you protect your people.

But if you do not protect them — or worse than that, if you seem like you can’t be bothered to protect them — then you’re done. It’s over. People will not forgive weakness. That’s the one thing, by the way, that is not a partisan point. It is human nature.

Nero is the only Roman emperor whose name most people still remember. Why? Because he abandoned his nation in a time of crisis. And 2,000 years later, we still don’t forgive him.

Donald Trump’s response to these riots, which is ongoing, is the singular test of his presidency. About an hour ago, the president announced that he’s going to marshal all available forces — military and civilian — to stop these riots.

President Donald Trump: If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.

Good for him.

Immediately after that address, the president walked over to St. John’s, which, we just told you, was burning fewer than 24 hours ago, and that provided a powerful symbolic gesture. It was a declaration that this country — our national symbols, our oldest institutions — will not be desecrated and defeated by nihilistic destruction. We fervently hope this all works.

What Americans want most right now is an end to this chaos. They want their cities to be saved. They want this to stop immediately. If the commander-in-chief cannot stop it, he will lose in November. The left will blame him for the atrocities they encouraged, and some voters will agree.

Donald Trump is the president. Presidents save countries. That’s their job. That’s why we hire them. It’s that simple.

Some key advisers around the president don’t seem to understand this or the gravity of the moment. No matter what happens, they’ll tell you, our voters aren’t going anywhere. The trailer parks are rock solid. What choice do they have? They’ve got to vote for us.

Jared Kushner, for one, has made that point out loud. No one has more contempt for Donald Trump’s voters than Jared Kushner does, and no one expresses it more frequently.

In 2016, Donald Trump ran as a law and order candidate because he meant it, and his views remain fundamentally unchanged today. But the president’s famously sharp instincts, the ones that won him the presidency almost four years ago, have been since subverted at every level by Jared Kushner. This is true on immigration, on foreign policy, and especially on law enforcement.

As crime in this country continues to rise, Jared Kushner has led a highly aggressive effort to let more criminals out of prison and back on to the streets. This is reckless. At this moment in time, it is insane. It continues to happen.

The president seems to sense this. At times he seems aware he is being led in the wrong direction. He often derides Kushner as a liberal and that’s correct, Kushner is. But Kushner has convinced the president that throwing open the prisons is the key to winning African-American votes in the fall and that those votes are essential to his reelection.

Several times over the past few days, the president has signaled that he would very much like to crack down on rioters — that is his instinct. If you’ve watched him, you’ll believe it. But every time he has been talked out of it by Jared Kushner and by aides that Kushner has hired and controls.

Kushner’s assumption, apparently, is that African-American voters like looting. That is wrong. Normal Americans of all colors hate looting, obviously. Why wouldn’t they hate looting? They are decent people.

So one of the lessons of all that we have seen and we’ve seen so much over the past five days is America is going to change because of this — that is certain. What can we learn from it? What should we demand going forward?

The first thing to know is that we can no longer accept race-baiting from our leaders. Never. That has become so common now that we barely notice it. But it is dividing and destroying this country. We should make them stop.

On Sunday, for example, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle tweeted this: “I want to acknowledge that much of the violence and destruction both here in Seattle and across the country has been instigated and perpetrated by white men.”

Is that factually true? Who knows? Who cares? The skin color of criminals is totally irrelevant to how we prosecute them for the crimes they commit. It must be irrelevant. Otherwise, we’re committing the bigotry we claim to abhor.

Yet everywhere on television and social media, prominent people are now talking exactly like this. Not just a few crackpots — thousands of people, well-known people. They are amplifying race hatred at exactly the moment that we need at least at the moment when it’s the most dangerous.

This is Art Acevedo. Acevedo with the police chief of Houston. Houston is the fourth biggest city in this country.

Acevedo’s job, his sworn duty, is to enforce the law fairly and evenly regardless of the ethnicity of the suspect. Watch this and tell us if you think he is capable of doing that. Do you think he’s even interested?

Art Acevedo, chief of the Houston Police department: People for — as an immigrant, we are raised like this. But you know what? We built this country … We have got news for them. We ain’t going nowhere. We ain’t going nowhere. I think the ship has sailed.

So if you’ve got hate in your heart for people of color, get over it, because this city is a minority-majority city.

“My people.” If a police chief of any color — any color — said that, we would attack him instantly, and we would mean it. It is wrong.

When you run a law enforcement agency, you don’t get to consider “my people” much less claim your people deserve some kind of special consideration because they “built this country.” No. Your obligation is not to consider your people, but all people and consider them equally. Period.

Art Acevedo is not even trying to do that. Imagine being arrested by this creep. Think you’d get a fair shake?

There’s almost nothing that hurts America more than this. If you are worried about the rise of extremism here — and honestly, you should be worried — this kind of insanity is absolutely certain to cause it.

And let’s be clear, when we say extremism, we’re not talking about unconventional views that get you bounced off Twitter or scolded by the corporate HR department. We mean actual extremism where people espouse violence against other people, where large groups come to believe their racial identity is the most important thing about them.

Now, at this moment, no matter what they’re telling you, no matter what they claim for political advantage, there’s not a huge amount of that in this country, thank God. Most people still think of themselves as Americans and want to. But if the left keeps talking like this, there definitely will be and very soon. And you don’t want to live here when that happens. We should demand they stop immediately.

Enforcing the law is not white supremacy. Insisting that everyone in the country follow the same rules is not racism. In fact, it’s the answer to racism. It is equality — equality under the law. It is the one thing we must defend, and if we don’t, it’s over. Things fall apart.

Weakness invites aggression. That is true in nature and it’s every bit as true in human society. Our leaders are weak. Predators know it. That’s why this is happening.

If you let people spray paint obscenities in City Hall, pretty soon they are overturning cop cars. If you put up with that, they’ll come right to the front door of the police precinct, and they will burn it down.

The next thing you know, they are beating people to death in shopping malls. And then what? What happens the next time the mob doesn’t like something? What will the mob demand next?

Let’s hope we never find out because we are close.”

Adapted from Tucker Carlson’s monologue from “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on June 1, 2020.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/02/tucker-carlson-this-is-how-nations-collapse/,2020-06-02
"After Falsely Claiming Tear Gas Use, Media Now Trying To Pretend Tear Gas And Pepper Spray Are Identical","After the media reported that Park Police deployed tear gas, an aerosolized version of the synthetic compound 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile also referred to as “CS gas,” to disperse protesters in front of the White House, Park Police explicitly denied the charge:

To curtail the violence that was underway, the USPP, following established policy, issued three warnings over a loudspeaker to alert demonstrators on H Street to evacuate the area. Horse mounted patrol, Civil Disturbance Units and additional personnel were used to clear the area. As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park. Subsequently, the fence was installed.

So it was smoke canisters, not tear gas. And pepper balls explained the irritating effect that some protesters reported.

This directly contradicted thousands of tweets, print articles, and broadcast stories. President Donald Trump lambasted the media, highlighting a story this writer published yesterday. That article has some of the headlines from prominent media that falsely claimed “tear gas” was used against “peaceful” protesters.

His campaign requested corrections for the rampant publishing of false news. The media believe admitting error is a display of weakness, a belief Trump shares, so they didn’t admit the error or correct their stories. Instead, they claimed that they were essentially correct. Clinging to a CDC information sheet that ambiguously said “sometimes” (but not other times) a variety of things are called “tear gas,” they defiantly announced they would refuse to correct their erroneous stories.

In response to New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman saying tear gas and pepper spray are kind of the same thing, if looked at in a particular way, one Twitter user responded with screen shots of four New York Times headlines, adding “48 hours ago the @nytimes seemed to think they were different enough to mention separately in the headline…:”

It wasn’t just the New York Times. Until the precise moment that Trump wanted a correction, media had always separated tear gas from pepper spray.

Of the hundreds of Washington Post stories that mention pepper spray separately from tear gas, some were published in recent days. Samantha Schmidt, Rebecca Tan, Rachel Chason and Paul Schwartzman separated the riot control measures on May 31 as “law enforcement officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to move the crowd back…” Similarly, a May 31 video from the Post is headlined, “In U.S. cities, police use pepper spray, stun guns and tear gas on protesters.” There are hundreds of other examples.

Media told people that they could “see” the tear gas canisters with their own eyes, but now they must concede that those were in fact smoke canisters. So then they said that the irritant from pepper balls are the same thing as tear gas.

If tear gas and pepper spray are identical and interchangeable, as media now assert, then why were they so hell-bent on exclusively using the term “tear gas”? The answer is obvious. Pepper spray is a common device regularly carried by civilians, often women, to protect themselves from potential predators. You can easily buy it at the store or online. “Tear gas” has a far more incendiary connotation, as it is rarely used by anyone other than authorized law enforcement. The two chemicals are wildly different, though, which is why you will never see law enforcement use tear gas without gas masks because of its debilitating effects on the lungs. Tear gas uses an aerosolized synthetic compound to irritate the lungs and make breathing difficult. Pepper spray and pepper balls, on the other hand, are made from capsicum, the oil that gives vegetable peppers their distinctive flavor.

The effects of pepper spray can be quickly mitigated by milk, which neutralizes the oils that irritate the eyes. Milk has no effect on tear gas. Footage of what happened in Lafayette Park, to eyes trained to see facts rather than narratives, made clear that tear gas was never used. Police wore no masks. A protester was seen pouring milk on his face. Law enforcement walked through the smoke and fog, which media claimed was tear gas, with no ill effects whatsoever.

Even just hours ago the media were admitting the specific difference between tear gas and pepper balls as it relates to Monday’s protest. MSNBC reporter Garrett Haake, who led the charge regarding tear gas, was insistent that the police had used “tear gas (CS)” and not just “pepper balls and less lethal projectiles.” He was specifically asked about why he was so sure about tear gas, and not just pepper balls, and he said it was because of his experience. See here:

Of course both tear gas and pepper spray can and are used by police to disperse rioters, both can be abused by police against innocent civilians, and both are painful. Still, the media knew the distinction was important enough yesterday. Now they claim it’s no matter at all.

Why care about getting this particular fact correct? It’s worth taking a step back and reviewing the larger situation of how small errors become uncontrollably false political narratives.

On Monday night, protesters in front of White House grounds were cleared just before a 7 p.m. curfew. Some protesters in the area had torched a building on White House grounds and a nearby historic church the night prior.

The Park Police say that they removed the protesters because they had found caches of weapons on the street and that some protesters were “violent” and had begun throwing “bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids,” and climbing a building on White House grounds that had previously been destroyed by arson. Attorney General Bill Barr reportedly authorized the removal so a temporary security fence that had begun to be installed that day could be completed.

As the area was being cleared, President Donald Trump delivered remarks from the Rose Garden about the need for rule of law over the chaos of violent riots. After, he walked through the cleared area to St. John’s Church, which had been set on fire by protesters hours earlier, and held up a Bible.

The power of the imagery being impossible to ignore, almost immediately the media began reading off of shared talking points: Park Police had used “tear gas,” an aerosolized version of the synthetic compound 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile also referred to as “CS gas,” to disperse uniformly peaceful protesters for nothing more than a grotesque photo op. We live in a time of information warfare, where the media are more brazenly advocating for political positions against millions of Americans including the President himself.

The media wanted to hammer their political talking point home until it replaced the image of President Trump walking through an area that the night before had been given over to lawless mobs. So repeat they did: Tear gas, peaceful, photo op. Tear gas, peaceful, photo op. Tear gas, peaceful, photo op.

They would repeat it as much as necessary to replace the images of the buildings on fire, the rampant looting, the physical assaults — and a political leader walking through these areas to say the mobs would not triumph over Americans and rule of law.

There were elements of truth hidden among the deception. It was of course a “photo op,” in the same way that nearly all public things politicians do are photo ops. It is a common trope, in fact, for politicians to ride subways after accidents, or fly over areas devastated by hurricanes, or walk through areas beset by violence. Trump didn’t invent this common political maneuver and it’s not usually considered bad for politicians to not just speak but show what they intend to convey.

And there were of course peaceful protesters, even if everyone knows that the peaceful protests have been beset by horrific violence across much of the country. That some police were injured on Monday night in Lafayette Park from bricks and rocks being thrown doesn’t mean everyone was throwing bricks and rocks at police or planning more violent attacks with caches of weapons police said they found on the street. That some people were grabbing for their weapons, according to the Park Police, doesn’t mean everyone was threatening the peace that way.

Only a media that willfully downplayed the violence across American cities, that has led to death, injuries, widespread property destruction, fires, looting, and more, would claim that the police sound crazy to be discussing the violence they faced on Monday because some other group of people on the street were peaceful.

And even with the completely false claim of tear gas being used, it wasn’t invented out of whole cloth. Smoke canisters were clearly deployed, and pepper balls were also used. Pepper balls can be quite irritating.

But “public display” doesn’t sound as nefarious and dismissive as “photo op” does. “Partially violent” doesn’t sound as sympathetic as “peaceful” does. And “irritant” doesn’t pack the powerful punch that “tear gas” does.

The media chose political messaging over factual reporting. And it’s not nitpicking to demand precision on these things from an industry that claims to report accurately. Each falsehood by the media was used in a direction that was hostile to those Americans who don’t share the dominant media position that America is irredeemably evil.

For people who are adamant that the violent riot portion of protests be downplayed or ignored, even pepper balls are an egregious violation. But for those who see how millions of mistruths pile upon each other to create false narratives that always go in the same political direction, facts still matter and are worth fighting for.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/03/after-falsely-claiming-tear-gas-use-media-now-trying-to-pretend-tear-gas-and-pepper-spray-are-identical/,2020-06-03
Dear Progressives Concerned About Government Power: Welcome To The Club,"A paradox emerges from the burning cities across our country: a Left that trusts big government but not the cop on the street who represents it, and a Right that trusts the cop but not the government he represents.

The murder of George Floyd was horrific and justly causes moral indignation. The national conversation is a needed call to reexamine accountability in our police departments, and to exercise humility as we listen to neighbors who are hurting.

But another conversation is playing out alongside (though distinct from) this discussion. The Left has expressed horror at efforts, especially by President Donald Trump, to decisively maintain order while violent riots and peaceful protests compete in cities across America.

The Atlantic bemoaned “the use of military power to suppress democratic freedoms.”

David Ignatius of the Washington Post condemned Trump’s “attempt to outsource strongman rule to the military.”

The New York Times editorial board expressed horror as “soldiers trained for war in foreign countries stood on the corners of American streets” to defend against mobs of rioters. “Police are acting like the Constitution has been rewritten,” the Times warns.

Plenty of this dialogue isn’t particularly insightful, but the repulsion many have voiced toward a powerful police state denying citizens their right to be heard (which doesn’t mean a right to injure people and destroy property) isn’t a bad instinct. It’s actually an instinct that both sides of the aisle agree on more than they realize, if everyone would stop throwing things and think about it.

Distrust of government is a tradition going back to our founding. “I am not a friend to a very energetic government,” wrote Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison. “It is always oppressive.”

As a result, the founders carefully limited the scope and power of the federal government. Since then, conservatives have continued to be skeptical of strong government and big government programs. Ronald Reagan said it best in his inaugural address: “In this present crisis, government is not the solution to the problem; government is the problem.”

But in the last century, liberal progressives have celebrated the expansion of the federal government and its growing power. It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a champion of the Left, who transformed the size and function of the federal government, specifically the executive branch, when the Brownlow Committee recommended the creation of the Executive Office of the President in 1937. (Roosevelt’s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, was criticized when he replaced the president’s singular secretary with four aides.) Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, lauded by the Left, dramatically increased the role that the federal government played in Americans’ daily lives.

Under the administration of democrat Lyndon Johnson, federal programs (and their influence and power) expanded again, with “Great Society” initiatives such as Medicare, Medicaid, federal involvement in education, and public housing programs. Certain bureaucratic failures of these programs aside, the Great Society posed another reach by the federal government into Americans’ lives.

Today, a man who was almost the Democratic presidential nominee (twice) advocates for dramatically expanding the power of the federal government. Sen. Bernie Sanders has plans for the nanny state to become the provider of higher education, housing, healthcare, child care, and even high-speed internet. He also wants to erase the constitutional right to bear arms, and plans to pay for his excessive programs by taxing Americans.

For the last hundred years, the Left has been the standard-bearer for the growth of government. And suddenly, they’re reaping the results. They’re horrified at a strong federal government and its power to police its constituents. On behalf of limited-government conservatives: welcome to the club.

Of course, loving limited government doesn’t mean telling police to stand down while rioters trash streets and burn buildings. Society ceases to exist without order; the essential purpose of government is to protect your rights to life, liberty, and property.

However, in a cultural moment when no one seems to agree, perhaps conservatives and progressives alike can recognize a problem much higher up than their local police departments. If you give the federal government increased power over your life–your money, your healthcare, your children’s education, your housing–it shouldn’t come as a surprise when the government gets used to its authority at the first sign of grievances.

“A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have,” President Gerald Ford reminded Congress in 1974. The Left has spent a century chasing after a government that can provide everything its voters desire–and we shouldn’t be surprised that suddenly, the bureaucratic Leviathan has the power to take it away.

"To Prevent Another George Floyd Tragedy, We Must Fix Police Unions","No one wants to watch an innocent man suffocate under the knee of a cop while bystanders plead for his life. Yet millions now have that haunting image seared into their memory.

The question to ask in response is simple: what could have been done to prevent this? While I’m in quarantine and can’t see my students, I imagine their predominantly minority faces and wonder how can I keep them from a similar fate?

Policy recommendations to prevent another tragedy like the one that befell George Floyd have ranged from defunding the police to ending qualified immunity and military surplus transfers to departments. But if peaceful protests—of which there have been many—are to achieve any meaningful change, they need a goal.

In the particular case of George Floyd, there is an obvious answer: at least two cops should have lost their jobs long before the event even occurred. George Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, had previously received 20 complaints filed against him, resulting in two letters of reprimand. His partner, Tou Thao, was sued in 2017 for stopping a man without cause and beating him in the street. In both cases, their contracts protected them.

Unfortunately, this is more common than not. Even after the most egregious conduct, many cops keep their jobs. As previously reported in The Atlantic, there is a long history of precincts still employing cops that would have been fired were it not for police unions keeping them on the force. One off-duty cop pulled his gun on a supposed criminal while intoxicated, misfired, killed the man who was later deemed innocent, and then returned to work.

There are numerous stories of on-duty boozing, theft, and abuse. In each case, the police union fought to reinstate these officers despite their inappropriate conduct.

Unfortunately, our priors often blind us when it comes to any talk of reforming police unions. On the left, any contention against unions is untenable. An author for Slate acknowledged the tension between social justice and police unions but couldn’t bring herself to renounce support for any organized labor. On the right, there’s a strong wariness against being perceived as anti-cop or weak on crime.

In reality, reforming police unions should be a bipartisan issue. The right has a history of undercutting the power of public-sector unions and, in this case, doing so would help promote a greater degree of racial justice in our country. In response to the critics, a weakening of their powers need not imply a complete abolition of unions. Studies blame collective bargaining and other roadblocks to thoroughly investigating cops, not the existence of unions per se.

Yet as with all unions, so too do police unions protect mediocrity, if not incompetence, in a profession trusted with upholding law, order, justice, and safety.

Studies confirm this position. Rob Gillezeau, professor at the University of Victoria, posted about his upcoming research into police violence and unionization. His team found that collective bargaining leads to “a substantial increase in police killings of civilians.” The protections that their contracts allowed shifted the incentives such that, when there was a swift decision to shoot or not, those protections pushed the decision to fire.

Furthermore, Gillezeau’s research found that “collective bargaining rights are being used to protect the ability of officers to discriminate in the disproportionate use of force against the non-white population.” Similar studies conducted by Oxford University as well as the University of Chicago Law School came to the same conclusion: strong unions, and in particular collective bargaining rights, lead directly to an increase in the use of excessive force.

A related negative effect of unions is their tendency to retard or stifle any meaningful reform. After the Ferguson riots in 2014, body-cameras on police officers developed bipartisan support. Then, a union in Miami blocked the initiative.

When my governor Scott Walker sought to limit bargaining rights, police unions got an exemption. Aggressive union contention blocks any structural reform that isn’t merely an increase in funding. But funding is easy. Real, structural reform requires accountability and work.

What could this mean for other proposed reforms? Perhaps ending qualified immunity or the demilitarization of the police isn’t the answer. But if unions are left in such positions of control, such proposals won’t even get discussed.

I’m sympathetic to the crusades against racial profiling and excessive force. But, like many, I’ve spent too much time these past few days watching videos of rioters looting businesses and burning down police stations. Wanton hooliganism will not result in the change we need in America’s police forces.

A man died because a union protected two bad cops. For the sake of the innocent and for the cause of protecting all the good cops out there, the time to reform police unions is now.

White Paternalism Is Racism Too,"The riots in the wake of George Floyd’s killing have been decried by some black leaders, but you wouldn’t know it from listening to the media.

L. Joy Williams, president of the Brooklyn NAACP, tweeted Saturday, “I know that our anger and frustration is real. I feel it myself and I know it exists in my community and in Black people across this country. But my gut is telling me that something nefarious is going on here.”

Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP legal defense fund also tweeted: “Seeing some troubling clips. I hope that someone is putting together the clips of incidents from the various protests that appear to be perpetrated by ppl who are not protesting police violence but appear to have different motives and agendas.”

Read into their comments what you will — criticisms of Antifa or others — these voices have been effectively silenced. If only I had a dollar this week for every time a white social media influencer argued the riots are justified, or for every time a blue check mark begged their peers to acknowledge their privilege and fight broad-brush “systemic racism.”

Maybe I live in a particularly woke bubble. As the mother of two black children, I purposely follow other interracial families on social media to learn from their experiences. I also live in Waco, Texas, a place desperately hoping to overcome a deeply racist history. I am thoroughly surrounded by voices supporting rioters and bidding others to confess their privilege.

What I find in the place of overt racism, however, is aggressive paternalism. It is stunning to hear both public figures and my friends in the suburbs speaking sympathetically of the rioters. Arguing that black rioters or looters should be held to a lower standard than other Americans because of “black anger” is so patently racist, it confounds me.

“People didn’t cause the riots, the system did,” is a sentiment that denies agency. Statements denying that the African Americans rioting in Minneapolis, Oakland, and Atlanta have the will to make their own choices should shock us with their dehumanization. Yet these sentiments have gone positively viral thanks to the woke warriors of our time.

Worse still, these woke saviors draw attention away from the questions that ought to be asked about, say, police procedures. For example, the Military Times surveyed police departments across the United States and found that more than half give preference to applicants from the military. Another 2017 study of Miami and Boston police departments found that officers with military backgrounds were more likely to have a use-of-force complaint filed against them.

I am grateful to military veterans for their sacrifices. I’m not convinced, however, that a deployment to a battlefield in Fallujah translates well into policing the streets of American cities. While both are guardians of law and order, their approaches are different.

What happens to applicants who are not from military backgrounds? At least one police department in my area assigns non-military applicants to “do time” as correctional officers in prisons, a prerequisite to patrolling. What is it like for a correctional officer who guards known cartel members in prison, for instance, and then is reassigned to police a Hispanic neighborhood? Is that really a seamless transition?

These questions don’t deny that society needs law enforcement; they don’t imagine a progressive utopia wherein we can somehow survive without police. But these are the kind of practical policy questions we must be asking our local officials.

Instead, what’s popularly labeled “progress” is a repackaged white man’s burden. A white friend once told me she discusses race with her children “daily” because it’s the responsibility of having privilege. Never mind that exalting race to a daily catechesis might in fact serve to teach children that race is a fundamental factor in human worth — which is the very definition of racism. Elsewhere, I’ve seen the call for white people to “elevate black voices,” incidentally forging a new form of white saviorism. Paternalism is everywhere.

I am committed to anyone who will make America a more just place for my children to live. Like many Americans, I am hungry for it. It’s time for concrete efforts to end police brutality, rather than virtue-signaling social media campaigns. Point out bad policies. Propose solutions.

Some of us want to listen.

"America’s Elites Attend The Court Of King Mob, Where There Can Be No Justice, No Peace And No Truth","WASHINGTON, D.C. — For months now, driving through Washington, D.C. has stirred a strange, sad, dystopian feeling. Empty downtown streets lined with shuttered small businesses and wandered by drug addicts, the mentally ill and occasional masked workers. It didn’t seem like it would get worse, but then it did.

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, rioters tore through the city, looting shops, spray painting buildings, vandalizing the monument to the man who ended slavery, defacing the memorial to the actual anti-fascists of World War II, and setting fire to an historic church on one of the holiest days of the year.

To drive through Washington on Monday afternoon was to see black, white and Hispanic workers and owners cleaning up shattered glass, boarding over windows, and scrubbing curses and anti-cop graffiti off the walls and doors of their businesses. As I took pictures of the vandalized facades of an office building a few blocks from the White House, a middle-aged black man power-washing the walls next door walked over to say hello.

“This your place?” he asked, gazing at the 114-year-old Georgian facade now decorated with “fuck cops” and other related slogans.

“No,” I shook my head. “My friend bought it just a few weeks ago.”

“They’ll be back tonight,” he replied, raising his eyebrows and nodding in resignation. A few minutes of conversation later, he went back to cleaning his walls and I continued my tour.

Our city got off lucky, compared with the rest. Before Tuesday’s sun rose in St. Louis, a 77-year-old retired police chief was murdered while checking in on his friend’s shop. He’s just one of a host of the black Americans killed in the riots across the country, including a Homeland Security officer in Oakland, a 22-year old looter in Omaha, a young and peaceful protester trying to get away from an increasingly disordered crowd in Davenport, and a Louisville chef who dreamed of turning his outdoor BBQ stand into a restaurant. They were killed by bullets from rioters, police and frightened, threatened civilians alike. And not a one of them was killed for George Floyd.

In America’s cities, buildings have been burnt to the ground. People’s life work and savings dashed by explosions and destruction. Cars have rammed into police lines. People are afraid. And no amount of further destruction is going to help. The positive message that we once rallied around — that just one week ago held the nation captivated in sorrow — is scattered in the ashes.

“There was a car fire last night just outside my living room window,” one downtown resident told me when I check in. “It lasted three hours with multiple explosions.”

I’ve lived in Washington for half my life now. I’ve worked in its bars and restaurants, attended its churches, fallen in love with my neighborhood and bought a house. Washington is my home. It’s a home for my neighbors too, some with a similar background to mine — in their 30s, college educated and born elsewhere — but others who went straight to work after high school and have lived here from the bad old days through the renaissance of the past 20 years. Not one of my neighbors has expressed anything but disgust at the murder of George Floyd. None that I know are rioting either, and this morning from my porch I could see six American flags, two sports pennants and a rainbow flag with “Black Lives Matter” taped to its face — all waving peacefully in the humid spring breeze.

The same peace was not present here 52 years ago, when the riots of 1968 ripped through our city, burning nearby businesses to the ground, chasing the black middle class and nearly all white and Jewish people from the city, and leaving piles of rubble that would lie undisturbed into the next century. Unlike today’s riots, these were a mass uprising of working American black people, and yet like today’s and tomorrow’s riots, they completely failed to cure the problem of human weakness and sin. How could they?

While we can pray to God to help us exorcise hate, fear, intolerance, pride and wrath from our individual hearts, sin is here to stay. So long as society must charge citizens to enforce order, empowered with authority’s monopoly on the legal use of force, the wicked and the weak will abuse that power. The alternative is no police, and with it the very type of street justice we now see delivering verdict and sentence on our fellow Americans under the cover of darkness.

That doesn’t mean nothing can be done to curb police brutality. The complete lack of a commanding officer on the scene of the Floyd murder, combined with the tacit-to-active agreement of Officer Derek Chauvin’s colleagues, compounded by histories of use-of-force complaints about a number of the involved officers, point to serious breakdowns of discipline, training, supervision and culture in the Minneapolis Police Department.

But local reforms are not the goal of the evening’s riots. A quick survey of the slogans and parting artwork exposes the same radical movement with the same radical demands we saw in 2015 and 2016, pursuing the same suicidal tactics we lived through in 1968, barreling toward the same inevitable end of it all: A majority of both Republicans and Democrats supporting the deployment of the National Guard, and a completely natural decrease in public sympathy and support for the causes espoused.

The radical nature of these disturbances is lost on so many of America’s elite, who lack the requisite five years of memory to recall the last time Black Lives Matter exposed itself as the anti-police, anti-capitalist movement it is, storming Democratic stages, shouting down speakers, and providing name-brand, corporate-sanctioned cover for escalating violence — culminating in the murder of five Dallas Police officers.

And this time, far from its previous confinement to liberal tech companies and the Democratic Party, its righteousness is preached by George W. Bush, Nikki Haley, and a host of other happy travelers eager to signal their own shared virtue before King Mob’s throne.

On Tuesday, after days of renewed and escalating violence, destruction, and Klan-like church desecration, #BlackoutTuesday blocked out Instagram, a social media platform that beats even Twitter in the shallow vanity of its daily offerings. The pressure to join in was immense. “You know the industry,” one woman in entertainment media explained to me. “If I didn’t, they [the social justice warriors] would just descend.”

“Damned if I do, damned if I don’t,” a woman in the beauty industry complained.

The American Right to protest went only one way, though. To defy social protocol and share images of boarded up and smashed windows with patronizing criticism of the latest Instagram fashion was a terrible transgression. “Are you trivializing the legitimate grievances of the protesters,” one longtime family friend asked, “by comparing the vandalism of windows to centuries of systemic racism?”

“Property can be restored and is insured,” a college buddy wrote. “Black lives cannot be replaced… #blm movement is very needed, until such time that things change.”

The fashionable sentiments of its defenders are neither rare nor ill-willed. Citing the collective sin of America to make excuses and provide justification for wanton destruction in an unrelated, plurality black city with a black female mayor, black female police chief and majority black police department, though, is deeply wrongheaded. As is the idea that anything positive can be reaped from this madness — a tragic lesson the King Mob has taught us again and again, and will continue to long into the future.

The “attempt to derive a positive philosophy from this assemblage of negatives leads to absurdity and contradiction at every turn,” the great British philosopher Roger Scruton wrote just months before his February passing. “The problem, however, is that contradiction is not regarded by the mob as an obstacle, but merely as further proof of the great conspiracy by which we are surrounded — the conspiracy enshrined in the old majority culture, which told us that we must accept human nature, find our fulfillment within its bounds, and not engage in a futile metaphysical rebellion.”

The “mob,” he observes, “is by nature innocent: It washes its own conscience in a flow of collective indignation, and by joining it you make yourself safe.”

Both the absurd contradiction and the washed consciousness of this collective indignation reach all the way to the top of Washington’s Catholic clergy, from where Archbishop Wilton Gregory protested the president’s planned trip to the St. John Paul II National Shrine, saying he finds “it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we disagree.”

“Even with whom we disagree.”

Baffling indeed. And hardly a display of courage. When the secular elite are in the court of King Mob, it would take courage to stand outside. Courage like the kind displayed by an elderly black woman who co-owns Brooklyn’s Valentine Deli — a deli that was ransacked in the name of Black Lives Matter. The kind displayed by the members of Minneapolis’s African Americans Heritage Gun Club, who are defending small businesses from the destruction perpetrated in the name of this movement for justice.

On his last day on earth, George Floyd was granted no peace. In Wednesday’s long-due announcement of charges against those involved, there may yet be justice. But on our streets this week, there will be neither justice, nor peace, and from the street’s courtiers in power, no truth. It’s a delicate thing, these three, and one we, a human and therefore imperfect society, have been working toward for 2,000 years. None can exist in the absence of any other — and all are banished from the Kingdom of King Mob.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/04/americas-elites-attend-the-court-of-king-mob-where-there-can-be-no-justice-no-peace-and-no-truth/,2020-06-04
‘Abolish The Police’ Is A Slogan For The Destruction Of America,"If you thought “abolish the police”—or it’s more moderate iteration, “defund the police”—was just some asinine slogan blue-check journalists, woke academics, and pandering public officials post on Twitter to show they support the Black Lives Matter movement, then you’re not keeping up with the revolution.

This week Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, announced the city would be slashing the police department’s budget by $100 to $150 million and instead “reinvesting in black communities and communities of color.” The cuts to the LA police will make up the bulk of $250 million in funds to be reallocated to “end racism in our city,” Garcetti said. How exactly those millions will be spent remains unclear, but the mayor has in mind investments “in jobs, in education, and healing.”

It’s unclear how cutting funds for the police will bring about healing in a city wracked by widespread looting and riots that forced Garcetti to request assistance from the National Guard to restore order last weekend. But it does demonstrate the extent to which BLM has been able to turn what should’ve just been an idiotic Twitter hashtag into actual policy.

In Minneapolis, where George Floyd died in police custody on May 25, kicking off nationwide protests and riots, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board terminated its contract with the city’s police department on Thursday following a similar move by the city’s school district. The University of Minnesota, museums and other venues have likewise severed ties partially or completely with the city police.

That means the parks will no longer use the city’s police to staff park events, and park police will no longer respond to requests for assistance from city police. It means no more school resource officers in public schools. It means, in general, fewer cops doing police work throughout the city.

Some in Minneapolis want to go even further. This week Rep. Ilhan Omar endorsed the idea of disbanding the Minneapolis Police Department, an idea put forward by a Minneapolis City Council member who wants to “reimagine what public safety means,” and “reinvest in cultural competency and mental health training, de-escalation and conflict resolution.”

Attacking The Police Is An Elite Luxury

BLM activists are celebrating these developments—it’s long been one their core demands—but so are people like Brian Fallon, former Justice Department spokesman and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign press secretary, as well as supposedly moderate think tankers like the Niskanen Center’s Will Wilkinson, who tweeted out unironically that “communities no longer required to finance police with their taxes will purchase some other form of more accountable security.”

Fallon and Wilkinson and others like them seem completely unaware that these other forms of security—the mafia, cartels, armed militias—are far less accountable than the police. If you want to know what that form of security looks like, look at Iraq, or Somalia, or Libya.

What we learn from those places is that people who know they don’t have police protection will seek protection from whomever wields power, which is why even now you see businessowners whose stores have been looted and burned out expressing supporter for BLM and the ongoing protests. Often they are simply trying to establish their bone fides and insure against future property destruction by the rioting mob. They are afraid, but they also know who wields force in their community, and they are responding rationally. The BLM posters in their shop windows might as well say, “please don’t ransack my business, I’ll say and do whatever you want.” This is what happens when the police stand down. It isn’t new, it’s old.

So is the predictable response of wealthy elites. The wealthy need not worry about the mob. They can hire their own protection, which is why you see celebrities like John Legend and Natalie Portman signing letters to defund the police. They will be safe in their gated communities, protected by private security regardless of what happens to the police or what happens on the street. Ordinary people, especially women and minority communities, will be the first to fall victim to those who seize power in the absence of the police—the very people these elites claim to champion.

And meanwhile, journalists on Twitter will apologize for not being woke enough soon enough, like Vox’s Zach Beauchamp and Matthew Yglesias did this week when they dared to question the logic behind “abolish the police.”

These are not calls to reform the police, to make any of the necessary changes to things like qualified immunity laws or police union privileges—changes that would make a real difference and make police more accountable. Such reforms enjoy broad public support and could be passed if local officials were willing to stand up to police unions.

But calls to abolish the police are not about police reform. They are not about fighting for dignity and equal treatment for black Americans. They are not about ending the violence and disorder now gripping our cities. They are not about preserving or restoring an open and liberal society.

They are about power. And once the police are out of the way, those who called for abolishing them intend to wield it.

Here’s A List Of The Police Killed Or Injured In The Last Week’s Violence,"Police have been shot, stabbed, run over, and hit with objects across the country since the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis Police. These injuries and deaths have been unreported by the national media.

– A Las Vegas metropolitan police officer, Shay Mikalonis, age 29, was shot in the back of the head while struggling with a rioter. It appears that Mikalonis survived brain surgery, but he will likely never be the same after the attack.

– Twelve other Las Vegas police were injured during the riots.

– An active shooter also opened fire on law enforcement at a Las Vegas courthouse.

– Four St. Louis police officers were shot by an active shooter. Thankfully, all four are out of the hospital.

– A retired St. Louis police captain, David Dorn, was protecting a friend’s store from rioters and looters. They shot him while stealing “TVs.” A shocking video, live-streamed on Facebook, shows the 77-year-old black American lying in a pool of blood. Dorn’s death was little covered in the national corporate media.

– A New York police officer was struck purposefully by a vehicle. He is in “serious but stable condition.”

– Three Buffalo law enforcement officers were struck by a vehicle in front of the police station. Two officers are now seriously hurt, and two civilians died from shootings that were not related to the police.

– Three Davenport, Iowa, law enforcement officers were ambushed, and one was shot. Two civilians died in the attempted killing of the police officer, including a young black woman.

– One hundred thirty-two officers were injured in Chicago during a riot. During that riot, there were 48 shootings and 17 homicides. It is likely many of the homicide victims were black Americans.

– Nine Pittsburg officers were injured by objects during a riot.

– Up to a dozen officers in Rhode Island were injured during riots.

– An active shooter opened fire at the Oakland Police Department. At the federal courthouse in Oakland, the scene of an anti-police protest, two officers were shot in a drive-by shooting. One of those men, Federal Protective Service Officer Dave Patrick Underwood, was shot dead. Underwood is a black American and, first and foremost, a hero.

– Two officers were struck in the head with projectiles in Santa Ana, California.

– Two Richmond, Virginia, officers were shot. One of these officers has life-threatening injuries.

– At least five officers and two firefighters were injured during riots in Richland County, South Carolina.

– One officer was struck in the head by a brick in Albany, New York. The suspect, a 21-year-old white male, is now in custody.

– Four Prince William County, Virginia, officers sustained head injuries from projectiles, including large rocks.

– Seven officers were injured in Sacramento, California.

– Several officers were shot at and injured in Lynchburg, Virginia.

– Several Champaign, Illinois, police officers were injured during protests that turned into a riot.

– Three Oak Lawn, Illinois, officers were injured.

– Twenty-one officers were injured in Salt Lake City. What appeared to be a mostly white crowd threw rocks and other objects at the officers.

– More than 50 Secret Service agents were injured by thrown objects — including Molotov cocktails — in Washington, D.C. The “protesters” appeared to be trying to breach the White House fence.

– Three Denver police officers were in a police Rapid Deployment Vehicle when they were purposefully slammed by another vehicle. The impact also hurt a civilian standing nearby. The status of the civilian is not yet known, and one of the officers is still in the hospital.

– Well over 40 New York City police officers have been injured during riots, some severely. Multiple officers have been shot, stabbed, or hit with heavy objects. The latest incident involved a knife-wielding attacker who stabbed an officer in the neck, and two other officers who were shot — one in the hands.

– Videos from New York that don’t appear to be widely reported in the media show a cop getting slammed in the head with a heavy object from behind, and a cop lying on the street after being shot.

– Multiple Atlanta, Georgia, officers were injured during protests. One officer, a black American named Max Brewer, was run over by an ATV. The vehicle appears to have circled back in order to run him over. He remains in critical condition.

– Two Capitol Police officers were injured during a riot in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. According to pictures from the riot, it appears some protesters attacked the officers. In one picture, a white man appears to be trying to attack officers wearing riot gear.

"In The Death Of George Floyd, Perception Is Reality","Nationwide outcry over the needless death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement officers recalls a police incident from several decades prior, concerning a young man named James Mincey Jr.

On the evening of March 22, 1982, Mincey, a troubled 20-year-old with a violent criminal past, led two officers on a brief pursuit that ended with citations for speeding and a cracked windshield. Later that night, he was chased home by two other officers, who had noticed the cracked windshield and, not knowing other officers had already addressed it, attempted another stop.

As recounted by reporter Lou Cannon, the chase ended in the driveway of Mincey’s Lake View Terrace home, where he lived with his parents. Getting out of his car, Mincey challenged the officers to arrest him. When they tried, Mincey resisted. The officers answered with mace and radioed for back-up. The incident eventually involved 10 officers and a helicopter, with Mincey handcuffed with his hands in front on him.

When the officers attempted to re-handcuff him with his hands behind his back, Mincey fought back, leading another prolonged, violent attempt at arrest. An officer applied a carotid artery hold to Mincey, wherein pressure is applied to said arteries to restrict blood flow to the brain and induce graduated unconsciousness to facilitate arrest (like a “sleeper hold”). Eventually, Mincey’s hands were cuffed behind him, leg restraints were applied, and he was placed in the back of the patrol car for a ride to a local hospital for a check-up. At this point, Mincey was reportedly conscious.

Upon arrival, Mincey lost consciousness and went into distress. After two weeks in a coma, Mincey died April 5. His cause of death? Blunt-force trauma to the neck, implicating the chokehold. No charges were filed against the officers, however, as there was no evidence they had employed more force than was necessary to subdue Mincey.

Questions remain to this day surrounding his death, specifically whether the carotid hold was applied for too long. Estimates range from 20 to 30 seconds, but, as prescribers of the move explain, a properly applied hold ought to induce unconsciousness in seven to 10 seconds and, when correctly employed, does not restrict one’s ability to breathe.

The case was a watershed for the city and its police department. As reported in 1993, Mincey’s death was the 16th in seven years as a result of the carotid hold. His was also the 12th death of a black person at the hands of police due to the employment of this technique, dubious for an agency trying to move past a history that included brutality and racism. After Donald Ray Wilson, another black man, was killed July 21 the same year after the same move was employed on him, the LAPD banned the carotid hold.

Police Officers Steal the Life of George Floyd

The Mincey incident is instructive considering the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, in police custody on Memorial Day in Minneapolis.

Caught on video, a white officer is seen, for nearly nine minutes, pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck as Floyd lies prone and handcuffed on the pavement. Despite pleas from both Floyd and bystanders, the officer refuses to let up. Eventually, Floyd goes unconscious and is taken to the hospital, where he is later pronounced dead.

Apparently, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is permitted as part of the Minneapolis Police Department’s use-of-force policy. Like Mincey, the central issue appears to be the length of time the officer applied the move. University of Pittsburgh Professor David Harris is quoted as saying Floyd was under control and not fighting, and therefore it was not necessary to continue kneeling on his neck.

Former police chief and use-of-force expert Andrew Scott described the incident as “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training. He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him. I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”

Greg Friese of PoliceOne.com echoed these same concerns, saying, “This incident transitioned from a ‘man resisting arrest’ to a ‘man down’ without any perceivable change in tactics.”

This last point is especially important, since perception is what the public uses in judging whether an officer has exercised his powers prudently. As Friese explains, “Kneeling on the head/neck of a person complaining ‘I can’t breathe’ isn’t a treatment for respiratory distress. Don’t make the actual problem or the perception of the problem worse” (emphasis added).

The apparent indifference to Floyd’s well-being is what makes the incident so troublesome. Even if, as retired Chief Joel Shults explained, Floyd was still resisting in subtle fashion not easily seen by bystanders or on video, the optics of four officers holding Floyd in handcuffs and seemingly contributing to his death following a relatively minor criminal offense (counterfeiting) is hard to overcome. Resisting the urge to cast judgment before having all the facts must be balanced against the entirely reasonable expectation that police should treat those in custody with due regard for their welfare.

Justice Depends on Facts, Not Perceptions

Will Floyd’s death lead to changes as did Mincey’s? The four officers were fired the day after the Floyd incident, suggesting tolerance for in-custody deaths has dropped considerably, at least for the Minneapolis Police Department. Videos of police interactions nationwide have not only revealed the realities faced by law enforcement daily but have also made it more difficult for agencies to explain away controversy or provide cover for their officers.

The Minneapolis Police Department may have no choice but to severely restrict use of or entirely eliminate kneeling on a suspect’s neck as a permissible means of suspect control. Whether the move actually led to Floyd’s death is beside the point; the department will seek to avoid another public relations nightmare where an officer is seen doing something associated with the death of a black man in police custody.

Of course, nothing would send a message quite the same as the officers being convicted of murder. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and the other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin’s alleged crimes.

But finding the officers guilty depends on facts, not perceptions. With riots in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump placing pressure on prosecutors to deliver justice, the process will be fraught with tension. Unless incontrovertible evidence exists that all four officers murdered Floyd, the outcome is likely to satisfy few, if any.

Beware of Unintended Consequences

Finally, all should understand the potential for unintended consequences. What seem like necessary changes sometimes result in even greater catastrophe down the road. When the LAPD banned the carotid hold in 1982, officers resorted to using the side-handled, metal PR-24 baton and kicking as their nonlethal weapons of choice to induce compliance. Chief Daryl Gates warned that such methods were guaranteed to “result in injury in almost every case,” whereas properly administered carotid holds would not.

The results spoke for themselves. As violent crime in the city escalated due to the crack epidemic, use-of-force incidents involving the metal baton increased, resulting in millions of dollars in awards and settlements stemming from lawsuits. Injuries and reports of police brutality increased, culminating in an infamous incident just after midnight on March 3, 1991, in the same area where the Mincey arrest had occurred nine years earlier.

Caught on home video, a black man was seen being beaten by LAPD officers, setting off a media and social firestorm, engulfing one of America’s cities in a deadly five-day riot, the consequences of which are still feeling today.

The man’s name? Rodney King.

Minneapolis Politicians Rally Around Abolishing The Police Department,"In response to the unrest following the death of George Floyd, Ilhan Omar today became the first member of Congress to publicly support abolishing the police force of Minneapolis. The statement came in response to City Council members rallying behind the previously unthinkable policy.

The Minneapolis Police Department has proven themselves beyond reform. It’s time to disband them and reimagine public safety in Minneapolis. Thank you to @MplsWard3 for your leadership on this! https://t.co/AQfHM5M6eR — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) June 5, 2020

An article published at Time by City Council member Steve Fletcher argues that because of their inability to reform, he is supporting the call to “disband our police department and start fresh with a community oriented, non-violent, public safety and outreach capacity.”

The policy suggests increased use of medical responders, and the creation of vague “unarmed, community-oriented street teams.” The policy does not address how violent crime will be handled in the city. Minneapolis holds one of the highest crime rates for American cities in the country, with rape, robbery, and property crime at twice the national average. Fletcher goes on to complain about how police forces were unable to protect local businesses.

In addition to the support of Rep. Omar and Fletcher, numerous council members have backed disbanding the police, including the Minneapolis Council President, the Chair of Public Safety, and Council members Jeremiah Ellison, Jeremy Schroeder, and Alondra Cano. The group is currently controlled entirely by members of the Democratic Party, and one member of the Green Party. None so far have come forward to oppose the policy.

This movement is at the forefront of a nationwide push by groups like Black Lives Matter. While Omar is the first congresswoman to publicly support it, related proposals are gaining steam. More “moderate” ideas, such as defunding law enforcement and redirecting their funds to social welfare spending have also gained traction. Progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, just yesterday announced her support for the policy. Many more congresspeople and local politicians on the Left have yet to make their position clear on either plan, likely weighing the political headwinds of the unprecedented policy.

Slashing law enforcement’s reach is well documented to show increased crime rates, as disincentives from breaking the law vanish. This can even lead to more arrests in the long term. Historical studies from 1960-2010 show that on average, every $1 invested in police results in $1.63 in social benefits as fewer murders are committed. As of now, no major studies exist on the effect of entirely removing the police department, as the policy has never been seriously considered for a major city before.

"While Defending Rioters, The Media Ignores Slain Black Police Officers","Two terrible things just happened only days apart. In Oakland, during anti-police protests outside of a federal courthouse, federal protective service officer Dave Patrick Underwood was killed in a drive-by shooting that was targeted at the police. Another officer was shot but survived.

The killing of Underwood, a black American, has only appeared in a few national outlets—one of which was the Wall Street Journal. Cable news outlets CNN and MSNBC, meanwhile, appear to have completely ignored Underwood’s killing. At best, they glossed over it.

In Minnesota, just two days later, protestors gathered on an interstate highway bridge they believed to be closed. In a stunning video, they were almost run over by a semi-truck. Fortunately, the driver braked and drove in the middle of the road to make it possible for people to get out of the way. It is amazing that no one was injured. Well, aside from the driver, who was pulled out of his truck and beaten.

The trucker, Bogdan Vechirko, was later released without charges after it was determined that he wasn’t targeting the protesters. As it turns out, the real culprits were state officials, who closed the interstate without putting up a blockade or properly warning drivers.

The media ran videos of the truck moving into the crowd over and over. Admittedly, it was a stunning scene. But they left out the part where the trucker was beaten. There was also little to no national coverage after it was determined Vechirko wasn’t targeting the protestors. And some of the media that did cover the lack of charges made it seem like an injustice was being done.

A quick Google search reveals oodles of national coverage of the initial incident—much more than the killing of Underwood received.

Violence Directed Against Cops Is Being Ignored

Two days after the semi-truck incident, a retired St. Louis police captain, David Dorn, was shot and killed while protecting a friend’s store from rioters and looters. A shocking video, live-streamed on Facebook, shows the 77-year-old black American lying in a pool of blood.

Yet Dorn’s death also appeared in only a few corporate media articles and was hardly covered on cable news at all.

In Alabama, a white American cop was killed, although it is unclear if the killing was related to the George Floyd “protests.” The officer, Stephen Williams, was known for bridging divides in the community.

In Atlanta, a black American officer named Max Brewer is in intensive care after he was run over during protests.

All over the country, police have been run over, shot, or bludgeoned by bricks and other blunt objects. Police officers were hit by cars in the cities of Buffalo and New York. In Florida, an officer had his neck slashed.

While one Las Vegas police officer shot in the head could hang on and survive, he may never be the same again. Officers have also been shot in Virginia, Iowa, and Missouri. Including the 50 secret service officers injured in D.C. by Molotov cocktails, nearly 300 police officers have been killed or injured in the last week.

Do These Black Lives Matter?

At least three other black Americans have been killed aside from Underwood and Dorn. One was Italia Marie Kelly, who was killed in a shooting in Iowa when the crowd of “protestors” became unruly. Chris Beaty was a football star and a real estate broker. He saw thugs stealing purses and tried to stop them. “You don’t need to do this,” he pleaded, “there’s a better way.” Then they shot him.

David McAtee ran a popular outdoor eatery in Louisville. He was shot by police after, at least according to surveillance footage, he appeared to fire on officers. Only McAtee’s death was covered by the national corporate media, and the articles emphasized his barbeque business, not the fact that he had likely fired on police before they returned fire.

These are likely not the only black Americans killed in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing. The race of many dead Americans has not been revealed in the media, and some of the deaths have resulted from recklessness. In Philadelphia, a man died after trying to blow up an ATM. In Minneapolis, a looter was shot by a pawn shop owner.

So many innocent people have died. In Detroit, a man was shot and killed during protests by a drive-by shooter. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, aside from the pawnshop killing, three others are dead. Last week, a man’s body was found in an area that saw rioting and no police presence the night before. A woman’s body was found in the backseat of a car. Her body had suffered “visible trauma,” and the car was in an area “overrun with violence in the overnight hours.” And this week, another woman’s body was found in a car, this time riddled with bullet holes.

The Media Ignores the Lights in the Dark

The national media seems incapable of covering any of the uplifting stories during the chaos. In Minneapolis, people of all colors are coming out during the day to clean up their neighborhoods. Americans—in the absence of police protection—have defended their land, businesses, and families using the utmost restraint.

There’s also been plenty of positive instances of Americans bridging racial divides, and of protestors standing up to looters. In one video, mostly black protestors form a chain to keep looters out of a Target store. In another, thugs dressed in Antifa’s “black bloc” uniform, vandalize and loot while black onlookers yell at them to stop. In a set of pictures from Kentucky, black American men intervened to protect a caucasian police officer who was separated from his squad.

The media is intent on dividing us. They repeat the toxic narrative that police officers are targeting and killing black men when the hard data doesn’t come close to backing up their claims. They are willfully blind when “protestors” commit bad acts—like in Virginia, where firetrucks were blocked from going to a burning house that had a young child inside.

When mob violence is shown, they justify it. When the overall damage is too much to bear, they repeat the total fabrication that the carnage is being carried out by “white supremacists.” They gloss over or ignore Antifa’s role in the chaos, even defending the organization.

The Media Must Start Covering All Innocent Victims

Ultimately, the violence we’ve witnessed has been carried out by criminals of all ethnicities and races. It has, however, occurred disproportionately in Democrat-run states and minority neighborhoods. Yet progressive Democrats like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio have allowed violence to take place. In Minneapolis, cops were ordered to withdraw from areas that became lawless, directly resulting in death. Frey even let the Third Precinct Police Station in his city to be burned without permitting the police to defend it.

Progressive politicians allowed this because they take this part of their base for granted. It was a small but vocal element of their base who was rioting, and their supporters who have a voice (and dollars to donate) don’t live in these neighborhoods. Even so, many leftists from the suburbs or untouched upper-scale pockets of the city took to cable news or posted on social media about how the violence was justified. Frey, whose estimated net worth is $9 million, is a member of that elite.

The anguish of Stephanie Wilford, from Minneapolis, an older black woman who can be seen sobbing while she talks to a local reporter about the destruction in her neighborhood, is part of their “progress.” Unfortunately, she and others like her will never be shown on CNN.

The next logical question is this: Can a democratic-republic function when its media is so dishonest, it’s elite so corrupt, and when one of its major political parties allows street violence? The answer is probably not. God help us.

Minneapolis Mayor Kicked Out Of Protest For Refusing To Defund Police,"Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was escorted out of a protest in his own city Saturday after refusing to endorse the complete abolition of the police force.

After professing his “coming to grips with” his “own brokeness” for the sin of being white while standing in the middle of thousands of protestors, the demonstration’s leaders asked Frey whether he would promise on the spot to disband Minneapolis law enforcement protecting nearly half a million residents.

“Jacob Frey, we have a yes or no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis police department?” asked one woman half-wearing a “defund police” face mask. “We don’t want no more police! Is that clear! We don’t want people with guns toting around in our communities, shooting us down. You have an answer, it is a yes or a no!”

The movement’s hysteric leader proceeded to hush the crowd so the mayor’s answer could be heard across the streets so they could vote him out next year if he bowed to their anarchic demands.

“I do not support the full abolition of police,” Frey said, whose words prompted a swift removal from the demonstration.

The extreme demands to “Defund Police” however radical, have now become a hallmark of the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement that his picked up steam among left-wing elites.

Barr Says 'Peaceful Protestors' Are One Of The Big Lies From The Media,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr rebuked the false narrative perpetuated by legacy media Sunday that protestors cleared near the White House last week were gathering in peaceful demonstrations. On Monday, protestors were dispersed by park police by pepper balls as the city neared at 7 p.m. curfew by Barr’s orders moments before President Donald Trump walked across the street to observe the damage done to the historic St. John’s Church.

“They were not peaceful protestors,” Barr said on CBS’ Face the Nation. “That’s one of the big lies that the media is⁠—seems to be perpetuating at this point.”

CBS’ Margaret Brennan pushed back citing several of the network’s reporters who were present.

“Three of my CBS colleagues were there. We talked to them,” Brennan said. “They did not hear warnings.”

Barr explained:

There were three warnings given. But let’s get back to why we took that action. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, OK, there were violent riots in Lafayette Park where the park police were under constant attack at the, behind the bike rack fences. On Sunday, things reached a crescendo. The officers were pummeled with bricks, crowbars were used to pry up the pavers at the park and they were hurled at police. There were fires set in not only St. John’s Church, but a historic building at Lafayette was burned down.

Brennan tried to brush off the violence as simply “looters,” a characterization that Barr immediately disputed.

“Not looters, these were⁠—there were the the violent rioters who dominated Lafayette Park,” Barr said, noting that they broke into the nearby Treasury Department and were attacking police with projectiles. “This has been totally obscured by the media.”

Barr explained that the decision to expand the perimeter surrounding Lafayette Park was an order he gave to the park police Monday afternoon, with no connection to the president’s visit to St. John’s Church.

“The park police was facing what they considered to be a very rowdy and non-compliant crowd. And there were projectiles being hurled at the police,” Barr said.

Brennan once again cited reporting from her colleagues who observed no such behavior.

“I was there. They were thrown. I saw them thrown,” Barr said.

“And you believe that what the police did using tear gas and projectiles was appropriate?” Brennan asked, posing the same false charge that tear gas was employed at the park that day repeated by every major news outlet.

“This was not an operation to respond to that particular crowd. It was an operation to move the perimeter one block,” Barr asserted. “They announced three times. They didn’t move. By the way, there was no tear gas used. The tear gas was used Sunday when they had to clear H Street to allow the fire department to come in to save St. John’s Church. That’s when tear gas was used.”

Barr continued with criticism of how the media reported on Monday’s events:

All I heard was comments about how peaceful protesters were. I didn’t hear about the fact that there were 150 law enforcement officers injured and many taken to the hospital with concussions. So it wasn’t a peaceful protest. We had to get control of Lafayette Park, and we had to do it as soon as we were able to do that.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/07/barr-says-peaceful-protestors-are-one-of-the-big-lies-media-are-perpetuating/,2020-06-07
Biden Campaign Claims Biden Rejects 'Black Lives Matter' Demand To Defund Police,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign said Monday he does not believe in anarchic abolition of community police which has since become the latest demand of the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of “Black Lives Matter.”

“Biden does not believe that police should be defunded,” campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said. “Biden supports the urgent need for reform — including funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment… This also means funding community policing programs that improve relationships between officers and residents.”

The new spotlight on criminal justice and police reform have resurfaced scrutiny of Biden’s own past on the issue, which briefly came up in the early phases of the Democratic primary last summer, but faded as the field swelled and rival radicals began to shift attention elsewhere in the contest. In 1994, Biden played a key role in crafting the 1994 crime bill as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee coronating him as the “Architect of Mass Incarceration” by Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who tip-toed around the issue of defunding police on ABC’s “The View” Monday, also went after Biden for his previous opposition to bussing, a method used to integrate public schools.

The movement to abolish local police departments has become a rallying cry for civil rights activists convinced that every facet of American society is irredeemably racist and therefore requires radical changes that lead to the total destruction of law and order.

On Sunday, the Minneapolis City Council announced it had a veto-proof majority to officially disband the city’s police department charged with protecting nearly half a million residents a day after the Democratic mayor was booted from a protest for refusing to endorse the radical demands.

“I do not support the full abolition of police,” Mayor Jacob Frey told an angry gathering of Black Lives Matter demonstrators followed by a walk of shame.

Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender tried to quell concerns of those fearing rampant lawlessness by instructing those with such worries to check their privilege.

“I mean I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors – and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege,” Bender said on CNN.

Florida Democratic Congresswoman Val Demmings, who tops the vice presidential shortlist this summer told CBS Monday she believes the Minnesota City Council was being “thoughtful,” without providing explicit support for defunding.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/08/biden-rejects-black-lives-matter-demand-to-defund-police/,2020-06-08
Biden’s Pro-Cop Past May Hurt Him With Progressive Mob,"Until today, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been deafeningly silent on the radical anti-police movement gaining steam among progressives in his party.

The Democratic nominee has yet to personally speak on the issue, but Biden spokesman Andrew Bates claimed on Monday that “Biden does not believe that police should be defunded.”

Biden’s hesitance on the issue may reflect a realization that this is going to be a delicate issue for his campaign. But his past statements on law enforcement have been less careful, and are desperately at odds with current progressive calls to “defund” and “abolish” the police.

In July 2012, when he and then-President Obama were running for reelection, Biden touted that they were “honored to accept the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations,” in a tweet signed “Joe” to indicate it was personally written by Biden.

The President and I are honored to accept the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations. –Joe — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 26, 2012

Biden was the reason that the NAPO endorsed Obama in 2008 and 2012, according to NAPO’s executive director, Bill Johnson. Now, Johnson adds, police are no longer seeing Biden as an ally.

While organizations like Black Lives Matter and radical wings of the Democratic party call for the defunding of police departments, Biden made a point to criticize Obama’s Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012 for cutting police jobs and funding.

“Romney Economics means fewer teachers, fewer firefighters, and fewer police officers,” Biden warned.

In May 2012, Biden bragged about his track record of increasing police funding, reminding everyone that “In 2009, VP Biden helped secure $1 billion in grants to hire and rehire police officers around the country.”

In 1994, Biden played a key role in crafting the 1994 crime bill as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Cory Booker dubbed Biden the “Architect of Mass Incarceration” for his work on the crime bill.

The women on Biden’s shortlist for VP candidates have also mostly dodged direct support for the movement to “defund the police.”

Rep. Val Demings (D.-Fla.), a former police chief, hinted that she was not in favor of defunding or abolishing police departments, posting on Twitter that “we must ensure legislative efforts do not prevent America’s finest sons and daughters from seeking a career in law enforcement.”

To protect our communities and the life, liberty, and safety of every American, it is vital that we hold bad cops accountable, end unjust practices, increase transparency, and refocus police on their core mission: to protect and serve every American, regardless of their race. pic.twitter.com/CgLGKoQbja — Rep. Val Demings (@RepValDemings) June 8, 2020

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who the Biden campaign was reportedly vetting, had previously introduced a bill in 2017 that increased funding and manpower for law enforcement.

2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who has vocalized interest in being Biden’s running mate, bragged in a 2018 campaign pamphlet about supporting “a living wage for law enforcement,” drawing a contrast with her opponent.

If the Biden campaign doesn’t want to alienate a vocal wing of the Democratic party, he’s going to have to explain the strong support for police that he previously touted.

"CBS Deceptively Edits Barr Interview, Leaving Out Key Details On Violent Riots, Police Oversight","Key details on violent riots near the White House were removed from the broadcast of an interview of Attorney General William Barr on CBS News’ “Face The Nation” Sunday. Anchor Margaret Brennan repeatedly described protests as “peaceful” and the clearing of protesters to set up a stronger perimeter as unnecessarily rushed, contentions Barr strongly denied.

Left out of the interview that aired on CBS on Sunday morning was Barr’s detailed accounting of much of the violent context of that perimeter expansion, including that “bricks and inflammable liquid” were being thrown at police in Lafayette Square near the White House as rioters “were trying to get entry” over the fences, the five dozen officers guarding Lafayette Square who were “lost” the night prior in the violence, and the individuals who at the time of their forced dispersal “wrestled with the police officers trying to tear their shields from them, in one case, struggling to get one of the police officer’s guns.”

Some of the most colorful descriptions of the violence facing police officers at Lafayette Square were clumsily spliced out of the middle of Barr’s answers to questions. The rather important detail about a protester trying to get a police officer’s guns was simply removed from the end of the interview. These remarks were edited out of an interview in which Barr said media mantras about Park Police facing peaceful protesters were lies.

“They were not peaceful protesters. And that’s one of the big lies that the- the media is- seems to be perpetuating at this point,” Barr said.

Also left out of the broadcast interview were Barr’s detailed comments on how to improve policing, ostensibly the biggest news issue in the country. Barr said that experience and research showed that “you can actually get more focused change and more real change by working in more collaboration with the police,” and that approaches taken in previous years “make the police pull back and actually lead to more death, more murders, more crime.”

“What’s happened in the past is that politicians can check the box by slapping a consent decree on the department. We’re not interested in gestures. We’re interested in getting real results and working with police chiefs and- and- and public safety directors and mayors who really do want to change the system,” Barr said.

Off To A Rough Start

The interview began with Brennan asking Barr about CBS’ claim that President Donald Trump ordered 10,000 active-duty military troops into the streets, based on a single, anonymous source.

“No, that’s completely false. That’s completely false,” Barr noted, repeatedly and explicitly. White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah took to Twitter to further deny the report. “This is FALSE. I was in the mtg. @realDonaldTrump very clearly directed DOD to surge the National Guard – not active duty- after nights of vandalism & arson in DC,” she wrote.

Strong majorities of Americans support using the National Guard and the military to quell violent riots, but the media are strongly opposed to the use of the military in such circumstances or even the discussion of their use.

More Faulty Reporting

Brennan reported that Defense Secretary Mark Esper “publicly said that he opposed using the Insurrection Act.” Barr said, “I don’t think the Secretary of Defense said he opposed it. I think he said that it was a last resort and he didn’t think it was necessary. I think we all agree that it’s a last resort, but it’s ultimately the president’s decision. The- the reporting is completely false on this.”

Brennan taped the interview earlier on Sunday morning before it aired. When it aired, she went to the commercial break with a brief announcement that contained still more false reporting:

BRENNAN: I want to make sure to note that CBS News stands by our David Martin’s reporting. And we want to clarify here that the Secretary of Defense Esper does oppose the Insurrection Act. You can hear for yourself. MARK ESPER: I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.

First off, CBS did not explain why it stood by reporting from a single anonymous source that was rebutted by at least two eyewitness accounts on the record.

Secondly, Brennan’s characterization of the Insurrection Act debate is completely muddled and left out Esper’s actual words. The debate wasn’t over whether the senior advisors support or oppose the law of the land but whether they thought it should be invoked at the particular moment. Barr carefully noted that he and Esper didn’t think it should be used except “as a last resort.”

The full quote from Esper said just that: “The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort…”

Esper’s unedited quote didn’t rebut Barr’s characterization of the debate, but confirmed it.

History Of Military Use In States

About one quarter of Brennan’s full interview of Barr hit the cutting room floor. Editing for length is a routine practice in journalism. Later, CBS posted the full interview, revealing the editorial choices made by the media outlet. They are significant, particularly since so much of what aired was repetitious and built around anonymous reporting.

Edited out of the broadcast was Barr’s explanation of what constitutes a “last resort” and the history of using the military in the states, beginning with the country’s first president George Washington who “led the army into the field to suppress rebellion and insurrection in Pennsylvania in the very first term of his administration.” He noted he brought the military in last time he was Attorney General, during the George H. W. Bush administration, once in the Virgin Islands. “The governor opposed us at that point, but there was a complete breakdown of law and order. Lives were in danger, and we sent in 82nd Airborne military police, along with U.S. marshals and FBI agents.” The military was used to quell riots in Los Angeles as well.

“I would also point out it was done during the civil rights era in places like Selma, Alabama, and other places to integrate schools. The governors stood in the doorway. The governors did not approve the use of federal troops to enforce civil rights in the South,” Barr noted in the unaired portion of the interview.

Removal Of Important Updates On Policing

The most significant portion of the interview wasn’t about disputing anonymous sources or talking yet again about the expansion of the White House perimeter but instead the discussion of whether law enforcement is systemically racist. Much of that was left out of what aired.

Asked if he thought reforms were working, Barr said it’s difficult but improvements are being made.

BARR: And while it’s a difficult process and while law enforcement is not monolithic in this country, we have 50 states on a lot of local jurisdictions. There’s undeniable that progress is being made. We have a generation of police- police leaders in this country, many of whom are now African-American in our major cities, who are firmly committed to equal justice and to fair policing. And we’ve been working hard on this. And I would say, you know, the president, before any of this happened, was out in front on this issue. Not only did he enact the First Step Act to bring greater justice to the African-American community within the criminal justice system, but he set up the first commission on policing and the administration of the Justice since Lyndon Johnson to look at precisely these issues. And they have been working on these issues. And in the days and weeks ahead, we’re going to be expanding those efforts and coming forward with concrete proposals.

It is unclear why detailed reports of violent riots and police reforms were deliberately edited out of the interview that was broadcast while so much time was spent on CBS’ single anonymous source and his disputed report.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/08/cbs-deceptively-edits-barr-interview-leaving-out-key-details-on-violent-riots-police-oversight/,2020-06-08
CNN Guest: Not Wanting To Be Raped And Robbed Is White Privilege,"Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender said Americans ought to check their privilege when they voice concerns over the inevitable anarchy that comes from the removal of community law enforcement.

“Do you understand that the word dismantle our police free also makes some people nervous? For instance, what if in the middle of the night my home is broken into? Who do I call?” CNN’s Alisyn Camerota asked Bender on CNN Monday.

“Yes, I mean I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors – and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege, for those of us for whom the system is working,” Bender said. “I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality.”

Still, the Minneapolis City Council announced Sunday it had a veto-proof majority to disband the city’s police force protecting nearly half a million people. Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared his opposition to the proposal Saturday standing in a crowd of protestors after professing his “coming to grips with” his “own brokeness” for the apparent crime of being white.

“Jacob Frey, we have a yes or no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis police department,” one angry protest leader asked. “We don’t want no more police! Is that clear! We don’t want people with guns toting around in our communities, shooting us down. You have an answer, it is a yes or a no!”

“I do not support the full abolition of police,” Frey said, which prompted a swift removal from the demonstrations taking place in his own city with a walk of shame.

Don’t Abolish The Police Procedural Entertainment,"As the protests condemning the tragic death of George Floyd continue and the opportunistic riots rage on, the media has turned against the entire concept of the police with a vengeance. As such, several media outlets have decided to attack a staple of the American television landscape – police procedurals.

With recent unjust demonization of the police as a whole becoming a popular political stance from the woke crowd, their positive portrayal on television has come under fire.

Some have argued that the issue with this sub-genre of shows is their focus on the perspectives of their police protagonists at the expense of other voices. Despite this criticism being demonstrably untrue, it also is wholly invalid. The plurality of shows hyper-focus on the perspectives of the people they follow, regardless of genre.

That being said, there are several examples of law enforcement focused shows that highlight the perspectives of the criminals they chase or the communities they serve. “White Collar” focused on the professional relationship between an FBI Agent and a criminal informant, the latter who is the protagonist. “Broadchurch” focused as much on the eponymous town and its residents as it did the central murder investigation.

“The Wire” explores in raw and dark detail the problems with the police alongside their benefits, with both cops and drug dealers as sympathetic main characters. The show included an innocent black man killed by a white cop who faced professional but no legal repercussions, attempts at community-based solutions, and many instances of police brutality. Further, the entire premise of the show centers around an illegal wiretap.

Others have criticized the realism in the shows, citing an unrealistic case closure rate and a brushing over of any negative actions that occur in real life policing. Where is it written that sitcoms and TV dramas are supposed to be realistic? I challenge you to hold our most beloved series to the test of reality.

Twenty-somethings in New York City live in palatial apartments despite seemingly never going to work. High schoolers act like sexually liberated and scheming adults living in a parent-free and homework-free world. People in the government are well-intentioned idealists who just want to make a difference. Why should cop shows to be held to a higher standard?

Of course a show which predicates each episode or season on solving a mystery ought to end with some resolution. And, for the most part, people don’t tune into mystery shows or police department sitcoms to experience realism, but rather escapism. The happy ending is part of the deal. A major aspect of these shows’ appeal is both the excitement of attempting to solve the case alongside the characters and the catharsis of witnessing justice being done as the case ends.

If viewers wish to see actual crimes being solved in a realistic manner, there are documentaries and the news. Unlike the Washington Post, I have faith that TV viewers are aware that their favorite shows are dramatized, even the more grounded and seemingly realistic ones.

The Washington Post references a cost in ratings, but the financial impact was minimized to having to invest in new series to replace the plethora of crime dramas and police comedies. This minimizes the severe economic effect that eliminating these programs would have on the networks, as shows centering around the police make up not just a large percentage of the television offerings, but also a majority of the most watched shows.

According to Neilson ratings, 9 of the top watched 20 TV shows in 2019-2020 are focused on crime fighting, with “NCIS,” “FBI,” and “Blue Bloods” in the top five accompanied only by football. Further, five of the top ten longest running, prime time scripted TV shows center around law enforcement, including 21 seasons and counting of “Law and Order: SVU” and 20 seasons of both “Gunsmoke” and “Law and Order.”

There’s a reason there are seemingly infinite police procedurals on TV: people watch them. There is a set formula and it works. With the right characters and set up, cop shows can be overwhelmingly entertaining. And, unless you’re someone who now hates the institution of the police and unduly lumps together the good, hardworking men and women and the bad, there is something for everyone.

“Psych” and “Monk” offer goofy comedies with quirky characters and episodes that are equal parts suspenseful and hilarious. “Broadchurch” and “Luther” are brooding, character-driven drama with excellent performances and excellent twists. “Blue Bloods” focuses more on the interpersonal dynamics of a family of detectives and district attorneys. “The Wire” offers a violent, broad take on some of the issues plaguing the attempts to fight the war on drugs. “Sherlock” is a sharply written take on the famed detective.

These and countless other series are excellent parts of the television landscape, and many more clever, fun shows are on the way to entertain and excite viewers. It’s ridiculous to write off the entire sub-genre because it positively portrays a group with a few bad (and many great) people.

Four Reasons Minneapolis Shouldn’t Disband Its Police Department,"Nine of the Minneapolis City Council’s 13 members announced on Sunday they pledged to disband the local police department. With nine votes, the council would have a veto-proof supermajority.

“We committed to dismantling policing as we know it in the city of Minneapolis and to rebuild with our community a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe,” Council President Lisa Bender said to CNN. “[We need] to listen, especially to our black leaders, to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the solutions lie in our community.”

Bender told CNN she and the City Council were considering shifting police funding toward community-based strategies (whatever that means) but that ultimately the city council would discuss how to replace the current police department. “The idea of having no police department is certainly not in the short term,” Bender clarified.

Nine members of Minneapolis' city council — a veto-proof majority — say they'll start the process of defunding and dismantling the police departmenthttps://t.co/mAWBGAn5Pd pic.twitter.com/NG6C0lJfyC — CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) June 7, 2020

It’s a bad idea to disband any local police department. But as a native of the Gopher State, I’d argue it’s especially dangerous to disband Minnesota’s. Local officials should pursue significant reform instead. Here’s why the police should stay.

Minneapolis is an Area with High, Violent Crime

For starters, Minneapolis is not a rural town where crime is minimal. Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota, in the top 50 largest cities in the U.S., and it boasts one of the highest crime rates for its size in the country. The FBI’s uniform crime report for 2018 states, “Minneapolis crime rates are 82% higher than the national average; Violent crimes in Minneapolis are 108% higher than the national average.”

Additional stats provide national context: “With a violent crime rate of 1,063 reported incidents for every 100,000 residents, nearly three times the corresponding national rate, Minneapolis is one of the most dangerous cities in the country.” In 2019, the Star Tribune reported that police data showed “the city’s 37 homicides climbed 32% from 28 this time last year, while aggravated assaults, rapes and robberies also rose during the first 10 months of the year.”

According to CNN, Bender said she and other council members analyzed the nature of 911 calls by constituents and found most were for mental health services, EMT, and fire services. It’s not clear how many calls they analyzed or how they came to that conclusion given these outrageous crime statistics—unless Minneapolis residents have just given up. Regardless, there’s too much crime to disband the police force, even one that may have its flaws.

Crime is High—Without Police, It Will be Higher

Of course, one response to increasingly higher crime rates in a city like Minneapolis is to proclaim, “See? The police aren’t working!’ It isn’t the first time this discussion has taken place in Minnesota between law enforcement and local and state elected officials. Just last year, as crime increased, residents and officials wondered if increasing police staff would resolve anything and reduce crime.

Yes, crime is high in Minneapolis, but that doesn’t mean the police department should be abolished altogether, despite terrible incidents like we observed with the death of George Floyd. Without police, crime will increase to astronomical proportions.

Every year, there are approximately 8.25 million criminal offenses and 10 million arrests made by police officers. Imagine a world without anyone but community organizers trying to stop these criminal activities. From a basic civics class to “The Communist Manifesto,” any historical references and political ideology would reject the notion that a society that wants to be law-abiding, peaceful, and prosperous, should do so by disbanding its local police force.

In her book “The War on Cops,” Heather MacDonald explains that police do a lot of good in society. Through extensive use of data, she makes a powerful case that police are often painted as bad guys due to the media, Black Lives Matter, and even flaws within the judiciary. She says these attacks on cops are a blatant attack on law and order itself, and serve to make everyone less safe.

Read that again: It’s not the cops—it’s the way they are portrayed. In an article in the Wall Street Journal just last week, MacDonald said, of course, bad cops should be held accountable. She disabused readers, however, of the notion that there is a widespread racial bias among law enforcement. If you thought crime was bad now, it would certainly increase without a police department.

Police Presence Provides a Sense of Protection, Law, and Order

The presence of police, even if they’re not arresting folks, can help maintain order in a society that will generally wane toward chaos without it. From traffic stops or drug raids to attempted rape and robbery, a nearby police force provides aid for people who need it, particularly folks who are young, elderly, without a personal firearm, or just vulnerable.

This criminal justice policy reform article describes the role of police in people’s everyday lives well: “Community policing reduces crime and fears of crime as well as perceptions of policing discrimination. At the same time, it increases public satisfaction of police and increases positive attitudes toward officers. A recent analysis of the scholarship around community policing confirms its positive impact on community satisfaction and perceptions of legitimacy.”

Can you imagine a society without the presence of armed officers near the White House, outside a bank, or just patrolling your neighborhood? America’s 911 system handles 500,000 calls daily and about 183 million annually. Many of these are genuine calls for help. If your daughter was in college and was about to get raped, would you not want a police department available to answer the call? If your son was walking home from school and a stranger tried to abduct him, would you not want a police officer standing by?

It would be “The Purge” come to life—2013’s dystopian thriller where all crime becomes legal for one night a year because law enforcement is suspended. Except, this would be more than one night, and it would not create a better society. It would allow the worst of society to create anarchy. Only dystopian, authoritarian governments reject the idea of law-abiding officers that aid the vulnerable and weak leaving only the strong to ward off criminals.

We Shouldn’t Disband Police When Reform is Possible

No matter how overrun with violent protesters, rioters, or looters, even some cities seem to understand that it’s silly, if not absurd, to disband the police when what they actually want is significant criminal justice reform. In fact, there’s a bit of gaslighting going on about this. At the very least, there is confusion as some state and local leaders are clarifying they don’t actually want to defund or abolish the police—they just want reform to take place.

It’s obvious that despite all the good things police departments try to do, they are human, flawed, and make serious mistakes—mistakes that can, sadly, cost lives. Many on all sides of the political spectrum have advocated for police reform. Yet this Washington Post article bemoans reform, saying Minneapolis police already struggled with police violence, adopted reforms, and still, George Floyd died.

With all due respect, the reforms the department achieved were clearly not enough. Within hours of Floyd’s murder, it was revealed with a quick search that his alleged murderer, police officer Derek Chauvin, had numerous complaints filed against him that had been logged by the department itself.

Imagine if that policy itself had been reformed. Had Chauvin been fired after the second or third complaint, Floyd would be alive, the nearly 70 Minneapolis businesses that have been burned down would still be operating, and the 15 people who have subsequently been killed due to protests about Floyd would still be alive.

Just because some reforms didn’t work, doesn’t mean none will work. William O. Douglas said, “It is procedure that spells much of the difference between rule of law and rule by whim or caprice.” I’ve long said there needs to be significant policy reform when it comes to training. Shoot to kill should not be the go-to police mantra, among other issues.

The last time police reform came up, body cameras were an instrument of reform, and those have been useful, not only to prove the innocence of citizens but police officers themselves. Body cams can nail cops like this guy who was illegally planting drugs on unassuming suspects.

According to Jeremiah Mosteller of the Charles Koch Institute, “Police academies spend, on average, 228 percent more time training new officers on firearm skills and defensive tactics than community policing. Police academies and departments across the country seeking to adopt community policing should ensure that officers are equipped to be effective collaborators with their local communities.” There’s much that can still be done in the area of reform. Giving up is simply not a wise option.

Law enforcement serves an important purpose in a free society. The majority of police officers promote public safety and uphold the rule of law in an effort to preserve our individual rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No police department is perfect. Significant reform must take place. But we cannot simply disband local departments in favor of anarchy. Doing so will not help anyone, especially not the vulnerable among us who need police the most.

Kamala Harris Dodges Question On Whether To Defund Police,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-CA, dodged the question of her stance on defunding local police departments Monday morning on ABC’s “The View.” Host Meghan McCain asked Harris the question point-blank, twice, both of which Harris answered with a description of “reimagined” public safety in America.

“Do you support defunding and removing police from American communities, and if not, why do you think there is such a hard time being differentiated right now between defunding and reforming police departments?” McCain asked.

Harris criticized the current state of law and order for the overextended and ill-founded role of police, while suggesting the state allocates funding away from the police department to other resources.

“When I talk to law enforcement, they know that they don’t want to be nor or are they skilled to be the ones who are responding to someone with mental illness or substance abuse or the homeless population, but in many cities that’s what’s happening because we are not directing those resources, those public resources, to where they need to go which is addressing mental health, homelessness, substance abuse, so that we don’t have to have a police response because we are smarter.”

McCain explained how other elected officials like the mayor of Minneapolis have been forced to answer the yes or no question. “Are you for defunding the police?” McCain asked again.

Harris asked how McCain defines “Defund the police,” and McCain quoted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-MN, who suggested abolishing the police state and “bringing in a whole new way of governing and law and order into a community.”

Harris responded with vague neutrality. Her answer seemed to mimic that of Omar’s without explicitly saying she would support defunding the police.

“So again, we need to reimagine how we are achieving public safety in America,” she said. “And to have cities where one-third of their entire budget is going to policing and yet there is a dire need for mental health resources, for resources going into public schools, resources going into job training and job creation? Come on.”

Harris’ answer comes after many in the “Black Lives Matter” movement have protested against police funding and called for their removal. The Minneapolis City Council, in the town where the anti-race riots first broke out following the death of George Floyd two weeks ago, announced Sunday it had a veto-proof majority to disband the city’s law enforcement.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/08/kamala-harris-dodges-question-on-whether-to-defund-police/,2020-06-08
Let’s Look At The Actual Facts About The Alleged Racism of Police,"This past week, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with the second-degree murder of George Floyd, a black man. Footage and photos of Floyd’s death launched protests and riots across the country. Despite there being no evidence yet that the officer was racist, it is simply assumed that racism motivated the Caucasian cop’s abusive actions.

Law enforcement officers can be careless or abusive without being racist. In Dallas, in 2016, a Caucasian man died after being arrested in the exact same way. The officers joked about the man being asleep, but he had died after pleading for help “more than 30 times.”

On Fox News Sunday this past weekend, host Chris Wallace mentioned a handful of cases that he thought showed a racist pattern. He pointed to Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead by a retired police officer in February while out jogging in Georgia. He also mentioned a recent disturbing incident in New York’s Central Park, where a Caucasian woman who was walking her dog called police to report that she was being threatened by “an African-American man.” The man simply told her that the law requires her to keep her dog on a leash.

It’s worth recalling that following the nationwide riots after the Michael Brown shooting, the “Hands up, don’t shoot” aspect of the story was revealed to be false.

The media have helped create a biased perception that is far from the reality of shootings by police. A study conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center (where I serve as president) found that when a Caucasian officer kills a suspect, the media usually mention the race of the officer. When the offending officer is black, however, any news coverage rarely mentions race.

Furthermore, there’s ample evidence that black Americans aren’t all that fed up with the police. A July 2017 Quinnipiac University poll in New York City found that black Americans strongly support the cops in their own neighborhoods—62 percent approved compared to just 35 percent who disapproved. That approval rating was 11 percent higher than for the New York City Police Department as a whole. It makes sense that people only know their local cops but rely on media reports to form impressions about the parts of the city they are less familiar with.

More recently, a Monmouth University poll surveyed a national sample of 807 adults between May 28 to June 1, 2020, and found that Americans of all races are largely supportive of their local police departments.

Monmouth poll: How satisfied are you with your local police department (Very or somewhat satisfied/ Somewhat or very dissatisfied): College educated whites: 73% / 9%

Non-college whites: 70% / 14%

Black: 72% / 17%

Hispanic/Asian: 68% / 18% — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) June 3, 2020

Through our own extensive research, my organization found 2,699 instances of police shootings across the nation from 2013-2015. That’s far more than the FBI found since its data is limited to only 1,366 cases voluntarily provided by police departments.

The FBI data has other problems, as well: It disproportionately includes cases from heavily minority areas, giving a misleading picture of the frequency at which blacks are shot.

Our database keeps track of characteristics of both the suspect and the officer involved in each shooting, local violent crime rates, demographics of the city and police department, and many other factors that help determine what causes police shootings.

Officers kill black Americans at a higher rate than their share of the population: 25 percent of the suspects killed were black, 45 percent Caucasian, and 16 percent Hispanic. But that isn’t true where the highest concentration of deaths occur. Black suspects tend to die in larger cities with populations averaging over 600,000 (overwhelmingly run by Democrats), while Caucasians are killed in smaller cities with an average population of 250,000.

Caucasian suspects were slightly more likely to be holding a firearm than blacks (63 percent to 61 percent). Black and Caucasian suspects where both equally likely to have been involved in violent crime when they lose their lives, though blacks who died were more likely to be involved in drug or property offenses.

It’s important to note, however, that police generally have more challenging jobs in cities where blacks are killed. The average city where blacks are killed had a 61 percent higher violent crime rate and a 126 percent higher murder rate than where the average Caucasian was killed.

After accounting for these and other factors, including the average differences across police departments to deal cultural differences in departments, we found that black officers were at least as likely as their Caucasian peers to kill black suspects, but that black officers were more likely to kill unarmed blacks than were Caucasian officers.

The data offered some advice for reducing these attacks. While it can’t explain all instances such as George Floyd’s case, usually when more police are present at the scene of a confrontation with a civilian, suspects face reduced odds of being killed. For each additional officer, there is about a 14 to 18 percent reduction in the suspect’s chances of being killed.

This makes intuitive sense. Officers feel more vulnerable if they are alone at the scene, making them more likely to resort to deadly force. Also, suspects may be emboldened and resist arrest when fewer officers are present.

It is a dangerous fiction that prejudiced Caucasian officers are going out and disproportionately killing black men. But that doesn’t mean that measures can’t be taken to reduce shootings by police. The most obvious step would be to increase the number of officers, to avoid forcing lone, vulnerable officers to make life-or-death decisions.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/08/look-facts-alleged-racism-police/,2020-06-08
Nancy Pelosi Dodges Questions On BLM Demands To Defund Police,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dodged questions on whether she supports the anarchic proposal to defund local police Monday as calls swell to disband law enforcement in the wake of nationwide racial unrest.

“So there are all kinds of ways that we can come at this,” Pelosi said during a Capitol Hill press conference. “We want to work with our police departments. There are many who take pride in their work, and we want to be able to make sure the focus is on them.”

Pelosi explained that “there are many things we call upon our police departments to deal with,” including mental health issues and school policing.

“The public sentiment could not be clearer: we need to make some transformative change. Not incremental, transformative change,” Pelosi said.

We'll Never Have Police Reform If We Rewrite Policing History As Racist,"Cries for justice from the protests following the death of George Floyd ring out across America. Nearly everyone who viewed the horrible police confrontation that led to Floyd’s death acknowledges there exists a serious problem. But the more extreme protesters — a growing number, troublingly — have skipped right past any idea of reform and called for the police to be abolished entirely.

Part of the complaint includes the assertion — taken at face value, as in this article from Reuters — that modern police departments “first appeared in the 19th century, and in some southern states grew out of patrols organized to catch runaway slaves.” This mashes together a lot of history in a way that doesn’t make a lot of sense. Worse than that, it clouds the issue in a way that could make meaningful reform impossible.

Origins of Policing

Recognizing that there have been excesses — even criminal excesses — in modern policing is the first step in finding a solution. To the radicals and their friends in the press, step two is yelling an extreme slogan at the top of their lungs. Instead, we should note the flaws in this proposed “solution” while exploring others, looking for a thoughtful, serious, and literal solution to the sort of behavior that led to the death of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others.

A big problem is that there are too many laws being enforced, but protesters, unable to square the circle between progressive laws and libertarian enforcement, turn instead to a page from the 1619 Project’s handbook: Everything I don’t like is racist. While individual police officers have certainly been racist, and some still are, tarring policing itself as a racist enterprise is historically wrong.

The first modern police department was formed in London, a city with zero slaves. Before that time, law enforcement in all English cities and towns was performed by unpaid justices of the peace who directed parish constables. Even as the dislocations of the Industrial Revolution demanded new approaches to law enforcement, the English were reluctant to leave behind their system for one they thought might lead to continental-style tyranny. To the extent they did have paid constables, they were often seen as ineffective and corrupt.

This all changed in 1829 with Parliament’s passage of the Metropolitan Police Act. In “Cops and Bobbies: Police Authority in New York and London, 1830-1870,” author William R. Miller called the new London force a “preventative police,” and “the first modern police force in a nation with representative government.” That is to say, the Metropolitan Police tried to prevent crime by stopping it from happening, rather than simply arresting offenders after the fact.

Then, as now, some people saw the visible expansion of the power of the state as reassuring, while others found it intimidating. To walk the fine line between protecting the people without trampling their traditional liberties, Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, the first joint commissioners of the Metropolitan Police, developed nine principles that would come to define an ethical police force. This concept of “policing by consent” differentiated English police from continental equivalents by demonstrating that their role was to cooperate with the people to maintain order, not to rule them by force.

Policing in America

Boston and New York followed London by creating the first American police forces in 1838 and 1845, respectively. As in London, race was not the issue motivating the change. New York’s population in 1840 was 94.7 percent white, and Boston’s was similar. The issue was, instead, industrialization and an increasingly dense population (class tensions and anti-Catholic sentiment were likely also a factor as the cities’ leaders feared the growing mass of urban poor.) The old policing was meant for smaller towns and was ineffective at addressing the needs of a large metropolis. But the new systems had no more to do with race or slavery than the old.

Compare these high-minded ideals to the reality of slave patrols in the American South. In “Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas,” author Sally Hadden notes that these patrols had their roots in older Anglo-American traditions, but not the modern Metropolitan Police. Instead, they harken back to an older, informal method of law enforcement, adapted for the slave-holding society:

Efforts by slave patrols to limit the movements and behavior of slaves evoke memories of posse comitatus, the bands of men called out in early modern England to chase down and arrest fleeing felons. Likewise, the “hue and cry” that a constable would bellow in the wake of elusive criminals, calling upon all available men to help him capture the thief or burglar, also provided a model for chasing down slaves in the New World.

These informal systems were already in place in colonial times and carried over after the Revolution in those states that still had slavery, which explains why they were so different from the modern police inspired by Sir Robert Peel’s principles. The ad hoc, unprofessional, and often unpaid patrols of rural areas resembled the old-fashioned police that enforced the law in England under the pre-1829 regime.

The first police department in the South was not in the rural areas, where slave patrollers helped to keep black men and women enslaved; it was in New Orleans, the South’s biggest city, in 1853. Modern policing followed from urbanization, not racial strife.

As modern policing took hold in smaller cities after the Civil War, and as Republicans lost control of Southern state governments following Reconstruction, many of those once active in hunting down runaway slaves surely found their way into those departments. But the true successor to the slave patrol was not the police but the South’s first domestic terrorists, the Ku Klux Klan. As Southern legislatures enacted Jim Crow laws to regulate nearly every aspect of black lives, the police and sheriff’s departments there took over enforcement of those racist ordinances. And, perversely, they often overlapped in membership with the Klan.

Looking at this point alone, one could understand the confusion between slave patrols and the post-war police in the South. But the professionalized (if racist) post-Reconstruction Southern police were not performing the same task. Their job, done correctly, was the same as those of the cops in London and New York. It was not that a racist cadre was remade with new uniforms, but rather that the new concept — a professional police force — was corrupted by the racism of the society in which it existed.

Return to First Principles

This may seem hair-splitting, but the distinction matters. Believing that police “grew out of patrols organized to catch runaway slaves” means the institution is irredeemably corrupt, and adds fuel to the radical demands for abolishing all police departments. But understanding that all American police departments grew out of the vision of the early London police commissioners means that the idea of a professional police force is sound. It may be corrupted by bad actors, but it may also be purified by good actors.

Reform, not destruction, is the answer. We must recognize that we have moved some distance from the vision of Rowan and Mayne. They called for the police to “prevent crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military force and severity of legal punishment.” Yet since 2001, police departments have become militarized, gaining access to vast resources of surplus military goods that can render them indistinguishable from the “repression by military force” they were meant to avoid.

Another of the Rowan-Mayne principles would go a long way in resolving the tension in modern policing: “To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.”

This is the rule in most police departments already, but if it is not strictly enforced, it is easy for tension and distrust to develop among the people with whom the police are supposed to cooperate. Failing to enforce the rules on themselves makes their enforcement of the law on others impossible. Returning to this honorable tradition of policing by consent is possible, though, because that is the original condition of all English and American police forces.

Whatever injustice has polluted or weakened those traditions has not erased them, and most police officers still live by some version of these high ideals. If the entire concept of policing was no more than slave patrolling with badges, fixing it would be a difficult task, if not impossible. But modern police departments are a product of 1829, not 1619. They were designed to do good, and cities without them would be far worse off. The answer is not the destruction radicals call for, but a serious reformation and a return to the principles that made modern policing in the first place.

"Cities Like Camden, New Jersey Show The Dangers of Defunding Police","More than three centuries ago, British writer Jonathan Swift observed, “Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv’d, it is too late.” Well, a new movement to defund the police is well on its way. And in a remarkably short time, it has quickly outpaced the logic and common sense questions that could slow it down.

The goal of the “defund the police” movement is obviously to punish police officers for bad behavior. So let’s start there.

What bad behavior are we punishing all police officers in an entire city for? They certainly didn’t all place their knees on George Floyd’s neck, and the punishment for that officer began within hours of the incident, with his termination and then his arrest within days.

But the movement seems intent on putting all Minneapolis Police officers out of a job. That objective has been extended to all Los Angeles police officers now as well. As it gains traction in the national media, the movement is spreading coast-to-coast.

This should be the first sign of a really bad policy. Punishing everyone regardless of their culpability in an action is the best way to breed feelings of distrust and retribution. This is precisely the argument that many in the black community make—that its members are unfairly targeted by agents of the government, mostly (but not only) the police, without regard to individual guilt or innocence.

The fact that the left’s solution to this unfair treatment would be to target a different population for unfair treatment is typical of the hypocrisy of their policy proposals. But the screams and emotions and nonstop news coverage have given the idea legs that are not easily countered without thoughtful debate.

The discussion should, of course, start with what the policy aims to achieve.

We already covered the punishment aspect, but what about the other goals? What might those be? Better policing should be an obvious one. Better relations between the police and their communities should be another. Accountability for bad actions by police officers could be added to that list. So what does defunding the police gain in these areas?

Better policing through defunding is illogical on its face. Budget cuts decrease the ability of a police agency to train its officers and hamper its ability to attract quality recruits. Furthermore, it will reduce its ability to use innovative programs to improve public safety and public relations.

This of course assumes that defunding is meant to decrease the police department budget instead of just getting rid of the department completely, which in at least some circles is actually the goal.

Taking away training and resources and reducing available officers through attrition or even layoffs will not improve the relationship between the community and the police. How could it? Accountability for bad actions by the police would not be achieved through defunding either. When the termination and prosecution of bad actors within the ranks is simply not enough to satisfy the mob, the only achievement that the policy of defunding seems to accomplish is punishing the police. It’s the kind of overreaction we’re seeing in the riots that mar legitimate protests.

Of course, defunding a department isn’t enough for some; they’re calling for a full abolition of police agencies. What might this accomplish in terms of the goals of the police abolitionists? Probably not what they expect. Any city that abolishes their police would not become a “police-free zone.” Instead, the vacuum created would be filled by county sheriff’s deputies, state police officers, or even (in their absence) federal law enforcement.

This would begin just as soon as civil order begins to break down (and with it, the inevitable civil rights deprivations). Those advocating for police abolition police would neither wish nor claim this unintended consequence, but it would be theirs to own. All of these law enforcement levels maintain jurisdiction within the cities. And, as states are sovereign, not cities, cities only exist at the will of the state. Ultimately, even the most ardent city councils would be helpless to oppose it.

In reality, the police abolition movement will result in the police being replaced with other agents of order. Camden, NJ did experiment with this idea by getting rid of their entire police force and switching to the county police force, who then hired most of those same officers at a lower rate. Many brand new officers were also hired by the county to patrol Camden without the training, experience, or knowledge of the community that the former police force had. In a city that is 95 percent minority, Camden went from a 2/3 minority department to an agency that is made up of only 43 percent minority officers. A larger, less diverse police presence is probably not what the police abolitionists of today have in mind.

More disturbingly, cities will have less say in who does the policing. Will they draw their officers from the communities they will serve? Not if the cities cede that control to other levels of government. Instead, they will find themselves being policed by sheriff’s deputies and state police officers who answer to someone outside of their communities, using policies the cities are helpless to influence.

Alternatively, cities will get a bunch of the same officers they just got rid of, now wearing county or state uniforms, when the displaced officers get hired for the extra patrols those agencies are now picking up.

There are better solutions that achieve the goals of the defunding movement. One of the best is community engagement. This goes beyond the decades-old, nearly indefinable “community policing” concepts of the past.

Community engagement is not about “coffee with the chief” or ice cream socials, though these interactions are all well and good. It is about engaging community members and stakeholders with the police department and developing relationships that can shape what policing looks like in that community. It localizes policing, which is exactly what policing should be all about—gaining voluntary compliance with the laws, not making as many arrests as possible.

Public safety is to be measured by the absence of crime, not the number of arrests a police department makes. Engaging the community fosters these relationships and this more effective style of policing.

Conservatives are not new to the table in policing reform, but there is difficulty in partnering with those who are calling for defunding or police abolition. Both sides need to step out of the elevator and have a real discussion on what the goals are and the best way to get there. Alienating all of our police officers is not a good way to start.

What Happens When You Disband The Police? Look At Mexico.,"One of the most visible and insistent demands of the Black Lives Matter movement is the abolition or disbandment of the police—or at the very least defunding them, which taken to the extreme would amount to the same thing. “Abolish the police” has become a rallying cry among protesters and a litmus test for elected officials seeking to ally with them.

What comes after the police have been abolished remains unclear. Protesters and politicians alike are hazy on details, preferring instead to talk about “reimagining public safety” and throwing around vague terms like “community policing.”

Of course, in concrete terms what would happen if a city actually disbanded its police department, as the Minneapolis City Council pledged to do over the weekend, is that the county sheriff’s office or the state police—or perhaps even federal law enforcement—would step into the vacuum and the city would have almost no say in how it was policed or what policies county and state law enforcement agencies adopted.

But let’s say these ultra-progressive municipal governments could get their wish and abolish the police in their cities entirely. What would happen? Inevitably, an armed group would emerge and impose a monopoly on the use of force.

If you want an idea of how that works, look to our southern neighbor, Mexico, where over the past decade endemically corrupt police departments in some areas have been supplanted by autodefensas, or local self-defense militias. But before you get too excited about the prospect of paramilitary autodefensas policing American cities, understand that in Mexico these groups are a mixed bag at best—and at worst they’re not much better than the corrupt local police and cartel gunmen they replaced. More importantly, their mere presence in Mexico was and is a disturbing sign of societal decay.

The Rise And Fall Of Mexico’s Autodefensas

To understand why, a bit of background is needed. The modern autodefensas movement in Mexico arose during some of the most violent years of Mexico’s ongoing drug war. In 2013, a doctor from the cartel-ravaged state of Michoacán, José Manuel Mireles Valverde, organized one of the first self-defense militias to fight against the Knights Templar Cartel. He initially recruited ordinary men, shop keepers and farmers, to hunt down cartel henchmen and drive them out of their towns.

Initially, these ad-hoc militias met with some success, capturing or killing members of the Knights Templar, setting up roadblocks and ambushes, and expanding the number of militias operating throughout Michoacán. But as the violence in the region increased, the militias eventually caught the attention of the Mexican government, which deployed the military against both cartels and autodefensas. Mireles was badly injured in a plane crash in 2014 and was soon pushed out of a leadership role. Later that year the government ordered autodefensas to disarm as part of an effort to bring them under the control of state-controlled Fuerza Rural, or Rural Police Force.

By then, the line between autodefensas and cartels had begun to blur. The militias had been infiltrated by cartel members, including former members of the Knights Templar who knew the cartel was losing power. One former Knights Templar member, Nicolás Sierra Santana, known as “El Gordo,” joined the autodefensas movement early on but left when the government ordered them to disarm. He and other militia members went on to create a new drug cartel, “Los Viagras,” which today is affiliated with the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

Some of these self-defense militias were, for lack of a better term, fake autodefensas. In 2014, vigilante leader Luis Antonio Torres, nicknamed “Simón El Americano,” clashed with a lime grower named Hipolito Mora, who along with Mireles was one of the first founders of autodefensas. A large-scale shootout between the two groups in Tierra Caliente left Mora’s son dead, and later both leaders, along with some followers, turned themselves in to authorities.

The clash came just as the government was flooding the region with federal troops to prevent a regional civil war between armed vigilante groups—a move that many, including Catholic Bishop Miguel Patino Velazquez of Apatzingan, condemned, saying the government was willing to disarm self-defense groups but not the Knights Templar or its predecessor, La Familia Michoacana. Patino’s outrage underscored the deep distrust of institutions many residents of Michoacán had—and still have.

Even so, the autodefensas movement quickly went from being an organic uprising against a vicious cartel to a vigilante free-for-all. As The Guardian reported at the time:

Violence in the state has continued as government efforts to institutionalise the vigilantes into a rural police force have struggled in the face of deep rivalries between some of the leaders. The new rural police has also been damaged by multiple accusations that a significant number of commanders and officers have links to the Caballeros [Knights Templar] or other gangs operating in the region.

As the government stepped in to control the autodefensas movement, it became increasingly clear that cartel members were joining self-defense militias, especially in Michoacán and neighboring Guerrero state. Sometimes it worked in the opposite direction. Lacking resources and weapons, self-defense militias would turn to drug cartels for financing, and would later be used by drug lords as proxy forces against their rivals.

Today, autodefensas remain active in parts of Mexico but they have largely melded into the ever-shifting patchwork of gangs, cartel off-shoots, and corrupt local police forces vying for power and territory. The fragmenting of Mexico’s criminal gangs and armed groups has helped fuel rising violence in recent years, with this year on track to break last year’s record for homicides. As far as violence and corruption go, things are worse in Mexico now than they were when Mireles formed the first autodefensa group.

That is to say, the rise of self-defense militias in Mexico, no less than the rise of cartels, is a direct result of the collapse of civil authority. Absent a functioning state, militias are no more accountable to the general public than a drug cartel—and no more capable of resisting corruption than the local or federal police.

Autodefensas Are A Sign Of Societal Decay

The brief history recounted above should serve as a reminder to Americans flirting with the idea of abolishing the police, which for BLM activists isn’t just a slogan. Aside from Minneapolis—where on Saturday the mayor, Jacob Frey, was booed and heckled out of a rally after saying he didn’t support “the full abolition” of the police—cities like Los Angeles, Portland, and Toronto are taking steps to reduce funding for law enforcement, in some cases redirecting tens of millions of dollars to various community programs while slashing police budgets.

Make no mistake, “defund the police” doesn’t mean “reform the police.” It means take the money away, which means fewer police on the street—and in the case of Minneapolis, apparently no municipal police on the street.

That local elected officials would even consider such policies is deeply troubling. America might not be a failing state overrun with drug cartels and corrupt politicians, but it is sliding in the direction of Mexico. We have declining levels of confidence in our institutions and declining levels of trust across society in general. The fabric of our civic life is fraying badly, and calls to abolish the police are a sign of that.

Despite the insistence of the protesters, getting rid of law enforcement won’t usher in a more just or equitable order. But it will invite new arrangements for security, as it did in Mexico. These arrangements, however well-intentioned, will fall prey to the same corruption and unaccountability as the forces they replace, especially if the underlying causes of societal decay are left to fester.

NYPD Union Boss Slams Media: ‘Stop Treating Us Like Animals And Thugs’,"New York City Police Union Boss Mike O’Meara blasted politicians and the media for their depiction of police officers in recent weeks at a press conference Tuesday.

O’Meara used the conference to bring a voice to all law enforcement officers who haven’t received praise for their pursuit of justice and safety, and have instead been assumed guilty by association with racial injustice.

“Stop treating us like animals and thugs and start treating us with some respect. That’s what we’re here today to say. We’ve been left out of the conversation. We’ve been vilified. It’s disgusting. It’s disgusting,” O’Meara said. “Trying to make us embarrassed of our profession… Nobody talks about the police officers that were killed in the last week in the united states of America and there were a number of them.”

Holding up his police badge, O’Meara said it isn’t stained by someone in Minneapolis. “It’s still got its shine on it. And so do theirs,” he said pointing to the NYPD police officers standing behind him.

The press is vilifying us. It's disgusting."" pic.twitter.com/CXOPARKff7 — August Takala (@RudyTakala) June 9, 2020

O’Meara personally denounced the actions of the police officer who killed George Floyd, while raising up the majority of officers who he said deserve respect.

“We don’t condone Minneapolis. We roundly reject what he did as disgusting. It’s disgusting. it’s not what we do. It’s not what police officers do. Our legislators abandoned us. The press is vilifying us,” he said. “But you know what guys? I’m proud to be a cop, and I’m going to continue to be a cop until the day I retire.”

Following the death of Floyd and the subsequent riots, many have called for vast changes in local police organizations. Many have gone as far as to suggest defunding the police completely and implementing an alternate form of law and order to ensure public safety.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) suggested Monday on The View a “reimagined” public safety system. This would involve reducing the budget for law enforcement and redirecting it to other government programs and resources, including public school, mental health, and job creation and training.

Media coverage has also, in covering both protests and violent riots, largely failed to recognize law enforcement officers injured or killed while responding to outbreaks of riots and looting. In just one of many examples, a retired St. Louis police captain, David Dorn, was shot while protecting a friend’s store from looters. A graphic Facebook live video showed the 77-year-old black retiree laying in a pool of blood.

Republicans Must Be The Party Of The Police,"If you are watching the news or thumbing through Twitter you probably have the sense that the police are not very popular at the moment. In fact, you would probably be wrong. Over the years polls have shown that local police forces are overwhelmingly popular. Nationally the police rank third in a list of most trusted institutions behind only the military and small business.

Gallup tracking polls show wide support for police, as did a 2019 Civis poll. It may well be true that now in the midst of the protests approval of police has been somewhat diminished, but this is not the first police killing of a black person to become a huge national story. And yet faith in police keeps relatively steady.

As many in the Democratic Party take aim at the nation’s police departments, threatening them with abolition or defunding, Republicans must be rock solid in their support for the institution of policing. And they should do so not just because its politically popular, but because of why its politically popular.

There are a few things that most people believe about the police and policing all at once. They know that it is dangerous work; they know that if they ever need the police the police will be there, and they know that the police have a power unlike any other force in our legal system. Pertaining to that last one, people also know that when so much power is entrusted, abuse of that power is to some extent inevitable.

Those who oppose the police, who seek its demise or abolition, exist between two utopias. On the one hand, they believe that order can be maintained without the power being used to maintain it ever being abused. On the other hand, they believe that without police power, crime would simply wither on the vine. Both of these assertions are absurd. They represent a profound misunderstanding of human nature and the role of law to constrain it.

In reality, while disparities exist in the treatment of Americans by the police, the claim that police forces are irredeemably racist is just false. Most major police forces are far more diverse, not just in rank and file but in leadership, than many of the progressive outlets and organizations that criticize them. Underlying conditions in some poor black communities make police interactions more common and sometimes tense, but this does not point to widespread racism.

So far President Trump, who held a law enforcement round table at the White House Monday, and congressional Republicans have been sounding the right note. But it must be full-throated. It cannot be stipulated to that there is some scourge of systemic racism in law enforcement. There isn’t and Republicans need to be honest about that even at the risk of being called racists themselves. They also must force candidates like Joe Biden to answer calls to defund or abolish police.

As absurd debates over what “defund the police” does and doesn’t mean happen on the left, the right must not only support but celebrate the Americans who put their lives on the line everyday and come to your house whenever you need their help. People like the police, and they should. They are the line between order and chaos. Pretending otherwise, suggesting social workers will solve crimes with feelings charts is ridiculous and unserious.

Sometimes in politics an opportunity presents itself, which is both politically popular and the right stance to take. The GOP has such a moment here. Notwithstanding the relentless assault both physical and rhetorical from the left against cops they are held in high regard. And they need politicians to have their back in order to do their job.

A certain Romneyite breed of conservative will pay lip service to the shibboleths of the left when approaching the issue of police. This must be rejected. It is not rooted in reality but rather in a vain game of virtue signaling. Republicans must be resolute in their support of the police; if they are the voters will listen. This is a gift horse they must not look in the mouth.

The two parties are poised to take very different views on the issue of the police, an issue that was once more or less bipartisan and pro-law enforcement. Now we have Democrats who take a knee in protest to those who protect and serve. Republicans on the other hand must stand tall and proud in support of the men and women of every race, creed, religion, and sexual orientation who keep our towns and cities safe, free, and functioning.

Will Mayor Bowser Remove D.C. Mural Calling To 'Defund The Police?',"On Friday, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser unveiled a new street mural with the massive text reading “Black Lives Matter” lining the newly coronated “Black Lives Matter Plaza,” running directly to the White House.

Just hours later, Black Lives Matter activists staying true to form, condemned the mural as “performative,” arguing it isn’t enough. In turn, demonstrators painted over the D.C. flag to turn it into an equal sign and tagged on three extra words to read “Black Lives Matter = Defund the Police.”

While D.C. authorities touched up the street mural to restore the district stars, officials are currently letting it stay while Mayor Bowser has yet to make a final decision.

On Sunday, Bowser dodged the question when asked on ABC’s “This Week” whether she would remove the unauthorized artwork.

“It’s not a part of the mural,” Bowser said, adding that she hasn’t “had the opportunity to review it,” whatever that means.

Bowser’s office did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

The demands to “defund police” in recent weeks have become the latest mantra of the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

While some activists claim “defunding police” doesn’t actually mean “defunding police,” just like “abolish ICE” doesn’t actually mean abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (it does), the Minneapolis City Council announced Sunday it would be dismantling its law enforcement. When its City Council President Lisa Bender was challenged on what to tell anxious residents concerned about the absence of public protection, Bender said such individuals needed to simply check their “privilege.”

While shying away from saying whether she would remove the unauthorized addition to the city’s commissioned street mural, Mayor Bowser said Monday that the District of Columbia has made strides in its police reform in the last two decades.

“We’ve been on the pace of reforming our department for the last 18 years; we’ve had the commitment of wonderful police leadership,” Bowser said according to WTOP News. “This department is different than many places in the country because of that steady pace of reform.”

Bowser emphasized that the city has continued to invest in police while dramatically increasing spending in social services.

“I just want to be very clear that the budgets that we have sent to the council over the last five years have recognized all parts of public safety, policing, but certainly intervention and opportunity programs,” Bowser said.

Whether she will remove the message to “defund the police” from the city’s newest landmark memorial however, remains an open question.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/09/will-d-c-mayor-muriel-bowser-remove-street-mural-calling-to-defund-the-police/,2020-06-09
Detroit Protest Organizers Present Extensive Demands To Mayor And City Officials,"The Detroit Free Press, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and Police Chief James Craig met with organizers of protests on Tuesday to discuss 11 demands for the city to consider after George Floyd’s death.

The demands were as follows:

Defund and demilitarize the police

End Project Greenlight, a public-private community partnership that uses real-time camera surveillance throughout the city, and facial recognition software to identify suspects

Drop all charges and citations against protestors

Do not carry out eviction orders

Drop citations received by Detroiters during the stay-at-home order

End “consensual” sex between police officers and those under custody

Prosecute and fire any police officer involved in police brutality

Do not criminalize homelessness

Make Detroit a sanctuary city, a municipal jurisdiction that limits cooperation with the national government’s effort to enforce immigration law

Create an independent office for disabled citizens

Restore and maintain running water for all Detroiters

The demands, according to a news release, “reflected the aspirational vision of the type of society they want to live in, one free from police violence and punitive measures as a way of solving social issues experienced by working-class and minority communities.” The organizers who attended the meeting, however, left unsatisfied.

“Here on Day 12, we’ve run out of patience,” Tristan Taylor, one of the protest leaders, said. “We are done with black and brown bodies paying the price of patience.”

According to another organizer, Nakia-Renne Wallace, the meeting was the only one the group would concede to conduct in private due to the fact that the only action by the city appeared to be to create “a bunch of subcommittees.”

The Detroit Free Press said that more demands were listed, but were considered less of a priority to organizers because they are not directly under the mayor’s authority. Those demands included:

Release all non-violent offenders

Make it a requirement that all Detroit police officers live in the city



Stop using rubber bullets and military tactics

Decriminalize all recreational drugs

Invest in mental health and treatment for substance abuse victims

More punitive charges against officers who hide badges

Make it a duty to intervene for other officers

Abolish property foreclosures

End police union funding of district attorney’s office

More accessible structures for police accountability

Provide care for juveniles instead of jailing.

Minneapolis Police Chief Breaks Ties With Police Union In Seeking Reform,"Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced his decision to terminate discussions with the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis on Wednesday as part of a police reform initiative just days after the city council announced its plans to defund and deconstruct the police department.

“Race is inextricably part of the American policing system,” he said in a media briefing. “We will never evolve in this profession if we do not address it head on.”

According to Arradondo, the decision was the result of a set of reforms that he intends to use to “[ensure] the public safety of our residents.”

“What our city needs now more than ever is a pathway and a plan that provides hope, reassurance and actual measures of reform,” Arradondo said. “This work must be transformational but I must do it right.”

Arradondo said his hope is that by eliminating relationships with police unions, the Minneapolis Police Department will be able to actively and properly pursue cases of police brutality and misconduct when they arise. According to the chief, “there is nothing more debilitating from an employment matter perspective than when you have grounds to terminate an employee for his conduct,” but can’t because of the defenses set in place through police unions.

Other improvements Arradondo hopes to implement include “new procedures so that department leaders can identify early warning signs of misconduct” and how to address them as well as policies “to include both grievances and arbitration.”

“This is further examining those significant matters that touch on such things as critical-incident protocol, our use of force, the significant role that supervisors play in this department and also the discipline process,” he said.

All of these reforms must be passed through the veto-proof majority member Minneapolis City Council that previously announced its plans to dismantle the department and shift funding towards social programs intended to fix any systematic issues.

Despite that fact, Arradondo claims he will not give up on those “communities of color have paid the heaviest cost, and that is with their lives.”

“History is being written now and I am determined that we are on the right side of history,” he said.

Seattle Anarchists Demand Complete Return To State Of Nature,"The radical left-wing militia of anarchists that took over the Seattle City Hall this week released its long list of demands Wednesday to return its newly-established “autonomous zone” on Capitol Hill back to the public.

Thousands of protestors take over Seattle city hall; demand the mayor steps down after failing to control the brutality of the police. ""Hey hey, ho ho, Jenny Durkan has got to go!"" #blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/AK7WC3l0yc — Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) June 10, 2020

Among them include the total abolition of the city’s police force, the blanket exoneration of felons, explicit segregation in hospitals and schools, and mandatory re-education of teachers and public servants to adhere to the new world order after ousting the progressive mayor.

For those doubting whether protestor calls to “defund police” mean what the two words say it means, the Seattle demonstrators could not have been more clear.

“The Seattle Police Department and attached court system are beyond reform,” they wrote. “We do not request reform. We demand abolition… This means 100% of funding, including existing pensions for Seattle Police” (emphasis theirs).

The protestors seem to have already born the fruit of their new lawless community, where homeless people they invited reportedly stole their food.

In the meantime, the anarchic “social justice warriors” are demanding a complete ban on the use of force of any kind, enhanced reparations for police brutality, the destruction of the prison system, and the doxxing of law enforcement officers accused of using excessive force. Given the erosion of presumptive innocence under the #MeToo Movement, one could imagine what could go wrong.

In the absence of law enforcement, the Seattle rioters are insisting that replacing an ordered society with a socialist utopia will provide the exultant cure to the dark racist empire’s perilous ills featuring a new 21st century era of segregation.

We demand that the funding previously used for Seattle Police be redirected into: A) Socialized Health and Medicine for the City of Seattle. B) Free public housing, because housing is a right, not a privilege. C) Public education, to decrease the average class size in city schools and increase teacher salary. D) Naturalization services for immigrants to the United States living here undocumented. (We demand they be called “undocumented” because no person is illegal.) E) General community development. Parks, etc.

Add to that free college, extreme rent controls, affirmative action for black-owned businesses and radical re-education for those working in schools, medical care, or media masked as “anti-bias training.”

If the protestor demands sound familiar, that’s because they are. The radical re-education efforts are reminiscent of attempts in communist regimes like those of China and the Soviet Union to force its people into submission by regulating free thought to a totalitarian government cementing an authoritarian grip on power. The United States is now in the midst of its own cultural revolution brought about by decades of raising aggressively woke children through left-wing academia now permeating across mainstream institutions joining the movement. The Occupy Wall Street movement ten years ago foreshadowed the new cultural civil war that was inevitably to come.

Look no further than the nation’s preeminent legacy paper, the New York Times, cowering down to its own woke staff by apologizing for publishing a well-reasoned op-ed from a sitting U.S. senator while ousting the responsible editor in the process. Or HBO’s decision announced Tuesday to rip the 1939 classic “Gone with the Wind” from its library. Or NPR’s call to “decolonize” one’s patriotic book shelf (i.e., burn the books). Or the New York Times’s 1619 Project imposing a new curriculum on the nation’s schools to dramatically rewrite American history as one that is irredeemably racist built for the sole purpose of oppressing black people.

As the nation topples statues and purges history while policing dissenters, empowered activists across the country will no doubt join the mob. Already in Minneapolis, the city council announced it had a veto-proof majority to completely dismantle its police department tasked with protecting nearly half a million residents. City Council President Lisa Bender meanwhile, brushed off concerns over the absence of public safety as individuals needing to check their “privilege.”

"Universities Fire Faculty, Campus Police In A Rush To Display Political Correctness","As cries for the abolition of police departments intensify across the country, the ivory towers of higher education are scrambling to outdo one another in political correctness.

At UCLA, students demanded the university fire two professors: one who declined to give black students preferential treatment on their final exams, and another who read Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” — which includes the n-word — aloud to his class.

The sociology department at George Washington University apologized Wednesday for inviting students to a “virtual career fair” with law enforcement officials, in light of the anti-police protests sweeping the country. “We are deeply sorry we caused pain and confusion,” wrote the department chair. The original invitation, she added, “hurt many people in this context of national and international focus on police violence and police abuses, especially against Black people.”

In Seattle, where police are trying to respond to an “autonomous zone” set up by radical anarchists, Seattle University just issued a statement that it will not allow police to use its parking lots as a staging area.

Troy University in Alabama fired the head of its campus police force for what it deemed an “inflammatory” comment on Facebook relating to the death of George Floyd. “Did the officer make a mistake? Yes. Does he regret it? Yes. Was he intentionally trying to kill George Floyd I don’t think so. Did George Floyd plan [sic] any role in his own death? ABSOLUTELY!” a section of the comment read. Defending the decision to fire the police chief, the university said his comments did not “reflect the values of Troy University, and we are no longer confident in his ability to serve our students, faculty, and staff.”

At the University of Washington, Senior Director of Media Relations Victor Balta sent a letter to professors asking them to “be especially responsive to the needs that your students, especially those who are members of the Black community, may have for accommodations as we conclude the school year.” He further suggested that these “accommodations” be anything from extensions to making final exams optional. This came after some students signed a petition for professors to show lenience on African-American students’ assignments, and others emailed the school president asking for all finals and assignments to be canceled for the rest of the quarter.

The University of Massachusetts-Boston decided to take a stand by telling the police they were no longer welcome to use the university’s parking lot. In the past, the police have used the grounds as a staging area for events like the Boston Marathon. Now, “we are demanding answers for the militarizing of our campus, a deliberate act of violence against the Black, POC and undocumented students, faculty and staff of the UMass Boston community,” read a petition against police use of the parking lot.

Massachusetts’ Clark University ended its partnership with the Worcester Police Department, after four students were arrested as part of a protest. The Worcester police chief called the decision “disappointing,” claiming that officers from the department have attended some of the demonstrations as peaceful protesters themselves.

The director of undergraduate studies at Cornell’s chemistry department, Dave Collum, stepped down after students and faculty criticized a political opinion he posted to his personal Twitter account. Collum’s tweet suggested that an elderly man pushed to the ground by police in Buffalo, New York, was “feeble” and “needed to give that cop space,” and was at fault for the incident. “While Professor Collum has a right to express his views in his private life, we also have a right and an obligation to call out positions that are at direct odds with Cornell’s ethos,” Cornell President Martha Pollack said in a statement condemning Collum’s speech.

At Ohio State University, almost 300 faculty have signed a letter originally circulated by the school’s student government, asking the university to “cease on-campus operations and review off-campus contracts” with the Columbus Police Department.

At Harvard, students have renewed calls to disband the Harvard University Police Department. The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition sent a letter to the university president petitioning for the campus police department’s abolition.

As we’ve seen within and beyond the anti-police movement, what starts in the academic bubble often threatens to become mainstream. The example universities are setting now is one that suppresses speech, promotes double standards, and fosters an antagonistic relationship towards law enforcement.

Defunding Police Won't Fix The Chain Of Failures That Lead To Brutality,"George Floyd’s death is properly the responsibility of the senior arresting officer on the scene. Had that officer’s training been better, Floyd might be alive today.

Had the officer been disciplined or fired for prior improper behavior, Floyd might be alive today. Had the Minneapolis City Council, mayor, and local district attorney done a better job at police department oversight, Floyd might be alive today. Had local politicians not been so concerned about winning the approval of the powerful Minneapolis police union, Floyd might be alive today.

In his book “Outliers,” Malcolm Gladwell posits that culture can be a contributing factor in catastrophic airplane crashes. Beyond pilot error, most crashes feature other problems. By themselves, these problems are not fatal, but when added together they result in a cascade of failure: bad weather, low visibility, a minor mechanical failure such as a broken warning indicator light, contaminated fuel, engine failure, or a bird strike.

Floyd’s death offers a parallel list of failures. Many of them could be addressed with deliberation, persistence, and follow-up — things notoriously in short supply in our political system. Other systemic failures may take decades to improve. A few might be beyond the reach of effective government action, though likely not for lack of trying.

Encounters with Police

One factor likely influencing fatal police encounters is frequency of contact with law enforcement. A few factors other than systemic racism could explain this.

Police encounters are often initiated because of the need for probable cause to detain suspects. Any traffic violation provides an excuse for a law enforcement officer to pull over a driver and ask questions. This action most frequently results in a ticket or warning, but as police examine a car and its driver, they may develop information that leads to an arrest.

This is the root of the “driving while black” complaint of many of our fellow Americans who suffer a higher rate of being pulled over. Even Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, in a statement on the Senate floor in 2016, noted that in 2015, he was pulled over seven times — twice for speeding and five times for “driving while black.”

“Imagine the frustration, the irritation, the sense of a loss of dignity that accompanies each of those stops,” Scott implored his colleagues. “I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling that you’re being targeted for nothing more than just being yourself.”

If being pulled over for no apparent reason leads to justifiable anger, imagine having the police seize any cash in your car — or even your car itself. This is where civil asset forfeiture comes in. With its roots in maritime law dealing with piracy, modern civil asset forfeiture was created and expanded in response to the growing sophistication of international drug kingpins during the 1980s.

The practice allowed law enforcement agencies to keep the proceeds of items, including cash, seized during illicit drug investigations or even routine traffic stops — even if no guilty verdict was achieved or no one was even charged with a crime. It became very tempting, as cash and other valuables enrich law enforcement organizations without the need for taxpayer dollars. It’s essentially “found money.”

Civil asset forfeiture increases negative encounters with law enforcement. Possible reforms include requiring that any assets taken by law enforcement go to the state general fund, which would remove the profit motive for local police, sheriffs, and district attorneys. At the federal level, the Department of Justice can end the practice of “equitable sharing” which allows local law enforcement to bypass state restrictions on the use of civil asset forfeiture.

Using law enforcement as a revenue-generating arm of government also increases adverse encounters with police officers. This was a huge irritant in Ferguson, Missouri, and other towns where various fines and fees, including court fees, have become a significant source of government revenue. When someone is levied a fine for an infraction (say, uncut grass), failure to pay can lead to an arrest warrant.

The death of Eric Garner during an arrest in Mayor Bill de Blasio’s New York City in July 2014 is another example. Garner was accused of selling “loosies” — individual cigarettes without a tax stamp. In NYC at the time, cigarettes came with $5.85 in state and city taxes per pack of 20. No wonder an estimated half of all cigarettes smoked in New York are smuggled in.

Law enforcement’s time and effort ought to be invested in preventing and solving crime, two difficult tasks that are far more readily accomplished with community support. Collecting cigarette taxes and arresting people for unpaid fines make the vital work of public safety much more difficult.

While reforming civil asset forfeiture and the use of fines and fees to fund government will reduce the chances for police-involved deaths, especially among the poor and minorities, violent crime is a far more difficult issue.

Militarization of Police

In response to the rising violence that crested in the early 1990s, police culture became increasingly “militarized,” shifting officers’ mental framework from that of community guardian to that of an occupying force. This change in attitude, often starting at the police academy, occurred over decades and will likely require time and a concerted effort from the bottom up to shift back. It too often manifests itself in quickly resorting to SWAT teams, heavily armed no-knock entries into homes at 2 a.m., and the increasing use of surplus military equipment. All of these increase the odds of a fatal police encounter.

Violent crime is key factor when considering police shootings. From 2014 to 2018, according to the federal crime victimization report, an average of 1.08 percent of whites reported being the victim of violent crime, compared to 1.23 percent of blacks — with blacks’ victimization rate about 13 percent higher. More victims generally mean more calls to police for help.

Furthermore, in 2018, some 70.3 percent of the time that blacks were victims of a violent incident, the perpetrator was another black person. Yet in Minneapolis today, some groups are urging residents not to call 911 in response to an emergency. This may end up creating far more victims of crime, some of whom will die as a result, than would ever be the case due to a fatal police encounter.

Meanwhile, Chicago just suffered its most violent day in 60 years on May 31, with 18 people killed. Over the entire weekend, 25 people were killed and another 85 wounded by gunfire. Should this increase in violence continue, much of the current debate over policing will likely be forgotten as a nation besieged by crime might return to a familiar playbook.

It was rampant violence back in the early 1990s that led President Bill Clinton, then-Sen. Joe Biden, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, then a member of the House, to support the bipartisan 1993 crime bill. Both the House and Senate featured Democratic majorities that year. That crime bill funded 100,000 new police officers and started a prison construction boom.

Yet the violent crime rate had peaked in 1991, at a rate of 758.2 per 100,000 people, more than double the rate in the most recent year reported, 388.9 per 100,000 in 2018.

Demographics of Perpetrators

Violent crime is mainly the domain of young, single men. The most recent criminal victimization report from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, found that in 2018, males were responsible for 77 percent of violent incidents, females for 18.3 percent, and males and females acting together for 4.7 percent.

In a recent Washington Post article detailing police shootings, the authors note, “The overwhelming majority of people killed are armed. Nearly half of all people fatally shot by police are white.” The authors found, “Fatal police shootings are relatively rare events,” and most of the “[h]undreds of thousands of police officers … will never fire their guns on duty” during their careers. Further, 94 percent of the 5,400 people shot and killed by police since 2015 were armed with some sort of weapon — more than 3,000 with guns. “About one in four had some mental-health issues.”

The article went on to detail the racial and ethnic makeup of those shot and killed by police, noting:

White people, who account for 60 percent of the American population, made up 45 percent of those shot and killed by police. Black people make up 13 percent of the population but have accounted for 23 percent of those shot and killed by police.

When providing data on shootings and race and ethnicity, context is vital — context that when missing can lead to deeply unserious proposals such as the demand to “defund the police.”

The most recent crime victimization report found different demographic groups have different rates of committing violent crimes. White, non-Hispanics made up 62.3 percent of the population but committed 50.2 percent of violent crimes. Blacks were 12 percent of the population and committed 21.7 percent of violent incidents. Hispanics accounted for 17.1 percent of the population and 14.4 percent of violent incidents. While Asians made up 6.3 percent of the population, they committed only 2.5 percent of the incidents. The prior year’s report found that white suspects committed 49.2 percent of nonfatal violent incidents while black suspects committed 24.5 percent.

The offender data for 2017 and 2018 tracks closely with the Washington Post’s findings on the demographics of those shot and killed by police. Without mentioning the statistical connection between fatal police shootings and the rate of violent criminal acts, a reasonable reader of the Washington Post article might conclude that systemic racism within police departments is the main thing driving the higher likelihood of police shooting and killing black Americans.

Lastly, the role of healthy families, vibrant communities, and a strong economy can’t be understated. Violent crime doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and policing isn’t its main deterrent.

That said, if calls to “defund the police” result in reduced budgets and dismantled police departments, America is likely to see some of its cities get “mugged by reality” in the near future — with the preponderance of harm visited not upon generally wealthier and whiter suburbs, but upon those urban communities most vulnerable to crime.

Demilitarize Chase The Police Pup Now,"Why do civilian agencies need military gear? It’s a question conservatives and libertarians have been asking for years, but in the recent weeks of debate over police brutality, and calls to “defund the police,” many are waking up to the fact that we need to also demilitarize local police. And it needs to start in Adventure Bay.

Adventure Bay is the fictitious hometown to the cast of pups on the popular Nickelodeon children’s show “Paw Patrol.” The show has recently been criticized both on Twitter and in mainstream media as “copaganda” for portraying the police in a positive light, particularity through its main character Chase, a German shepherd police dog.

There is perhaps no better example in pop culture that highlights the need to demilitarize the police than Chase the police pup. While the show is allegedly based in Canada, it’s clear the Adventure Bay police department participates in Canada’s version of the Pentagon’s “1033 Program,” which distributes surplus military equipment to local law enforcement. Since 1990, the 1033 Program has distributed over $5 billion in equipment to local law enforcement agencies.

Police departments across the country, even those far removed from cities and densely populated areas, have received military assault vehicles, armored trucks, grenade launchers, robots, riot guns, night sights, military helicopters, and more, all in the name of “protecting and serving” civilians.

By the looks of it, Adventure Bay’s German shepherd didn’t miss out on any of these donations either. Let’s look at just some of the “equipment” Chase uses in his quests to rescue cats and help grandmas cross the street.

Transforming Spy Police Truck

Chase’s normal police patrol car has the ability to transform into a “Spy Police Truck,” which could be described as a high-tech Tesla-meets-armored-truck, complete with satellites and drone launchers. “Perfect for catching up with the danger,” the show’s narrator says. It would be impossible for Adventure Bay residents to see Chase patrolling their streets in this truck and feel anything but fear.

Projectile Net Gun

Chase’s backpack is perhaps just as high-tech, if not more so than his truck. Whenever Chase wants to capture a suspect, he voice-activates the backpack with the command “nets.” A cannon automatically pops out of the backpack and launches a fully open net ready at his target.

Backpack Zip Line

The backpack has another similar voice-activated featured, but instead of a net cannon, out pops a double-sided zip-line launcher. This allows Chase to connect to zip between any two previously unconnected surfaces. Military equipment like this in the hands of civilians is just another example of the direct result of America’s war on terror and response to 9/11, as Peter Suderman has argued at Reason.

Wall-Climbing Boots

These “wall-climbing boots” have ultra-strong suction cup soles that allow the German shepherd pup to essentially defy gravity, even launching himself from one moving vehicle to another. Watch how he performs this Navy Seal-like maneuver here:

Spy Drones with Homing and Tracking

Just to be clear, Chase is not stopping al-Qaeda operations on the Pakistani border. He is usually working on investigations like helping Mayor Goodway find her pet chicken. Yet the police pup’s vehicle is equipped with “spy drones” with the ability to “search for anyone who is lost.”

Studies show that more militarized police departments are significantly more likely to kill civilians. We must not allow children’s television shows like “Paw Patrol” to teach our children that military weaponry used to intimidate and repress communities is normal or acceptable.

‘Paw Patrol’ And Chase The Police Dog Are Good Examples Of ‘To Protect And Serve’,"First they came for the police Lego set, now the mob wants “Paw Patrol,” one of the most popular children’s cartoon show in the country.

Protestors and online trolls are coming for a show about animated animals who take care of their town by building, rescuing, and maintaining order and goodness. The Canadian cartoon on Nickelodeon follows a boy named Ryder and his team of six pups, each equipped with different skills, tools and a vehicle meant to help them protect and save those who live in the fictitious town of Adventure Bay.

Marshall is a Dalmatian who specializes in fire and EMT, Rubble is a bulldog whose focus is construction and rebuilding, Rocky appears to be a mutt who enjoys recycling and repurposing, Skye is a cockapoo who does aviation rescue and anything with heights, Zuma is a chocolate lab with jurisdiction and understanding of all things water, ocean, and lake, and finally, Chase is a German Shepherd police dog who also has spy training and just happens to be Ryder’s right hand man.

The show’s intent, according to Nickelodeon, is to promote safety, heroism, and show children what it’s like to work together with a team. In many of the episodes, the Paw Patrol is called into action by another character, Mayor Goodway, either for a mishap with her pet chicken or to help a struggling townsperson. In later seasons, the team is often employed to stop and fix anything the pesky Mayor Humdinger from one town over did in trying to sabotage special events and the nice people in Adventure Bay.

Like any notable name in the last few weeks, Paw Patrol also spoke out against racism by announcing that they would be “muting [their] content until June 7th to give access for Black voices to be heard.”

In solidarity of #amplifymelanatedvoices we will be muting our content until June 7th to give access for Black voices to be heard so we can continue to listen and further our learning. #amplifyblackvoices pic.twitter.com/NO2KeQjpHM — PAW Patrol (@pawpatrol) June 2, 2020

The tweet, however, did not go over well with some of the Twitter community. Hundreds of comments poured in taunting the show, asking for Chase the police dog to be removed or “fired.” Cruder suggestions included euthanizing the German Shepherd, bullying him into suicide, or calling him a class and species traitor.

While some of the comments may have been made in jest, the intent behind them was not. With recent TV cancellations such as AE’s “Live PD” and Paramount’s “Cops,” it really comes as no surprise that any show featuring law enforcement, especially one shed in such a positive light, may eventually come under scrutiny.

While the concerns and frustrations of portrayal in the media is a long-fought battle that should not be completely ignored, good cop portrayals like Chase the police dog are absolutely necessary. Our society and nation needs admirable examples of public servants for kids and adults to look up to.

In Paw Patrol, there is no portrayal of violent crimes or weapons by the patrol or anyone else. Instead, the show highlights and promotes the safety and rescue duties provided by the Ryder and the team. Arguably, these are some of the same duties that are being renamed and intertwined into #defundthepolice campaigns as community programs.

Portraying a good cop on the screen doesn’t dismantle or belittle the Black Lives Matter movement. On the contrary, it provides a reference point for education, reform, and the promotion of service by the police force. It brings the motto “to protect and serve” into the limelight and gives a positive example to model changes after.

Like any good kids show, the characters make mistakes and Chase is no exception. Not only does the police dog have to learn what it takes to be a good community leader, he also navigates fear and miscommunication within his team. Despite these challenges, Chase recognizes in every episode that his first duty is to the people of Adventure Bay.

If you think that removing “good” cop shows, tearing down statues, and renaming Disneyland rides is going to solve racism, you’re wrong. Racism was not created in a day and isn’t going to leave when things get canceled or removed.

Instead of lobbying for Chase the police dog to be euthanized, why don’t we instead focus on the ways he models how police can assist communities by protecting and serving. Use the example of one dog to educate children on what it means to be a good law enforcement officer whose duties are beyond that of arresting and shooting people.

Or better yet, if you’re offended by a German Shepherd police puppy and his rescue pals saving someone from drowning, a snowstorm, or even just helping an older woman cross a street, don’t watch it. You may be better trolling on Twitter instead.

How The Slow Spread Of Radicalism Turned Portland Ungovernable,"Some violent protests, starting in Minneapolis and rapidly expanding to cities all over North America and abroad, have challenged local governments’ ability to keep the peace over the past two weeks. It was unsurprising that chaos erupted in Portland, Oregon.

How did Portland, a smallish Pacific-Northwest city in a state that was once known for its moderate politicians, become an epicenter of radical activism and inadequate governance?

Starting with the Wobblies in the early 20th century, a thread of radicalism began in the city. John Reed, a journalist and activist who became the leader of the Communist Labor Party, was born in Portland. Speeches were hosted in Portland in the 1920s by such luminaries as “Mother” Bloor, a temperance advocate and socialist feminist, and Trotskyist James Cannon.

The situation we see today, however, began in earnest in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as Portland was transitioning from a late-stage timber town to a high-tech and professional services center. Frequent anti-capitalism protests in the downtown area that had previously been mostly small groups walking down sidewalks, only occasionally crossing against traffic signals, grew larger and more organized.

Mark Kroeker’s Effect on Portland Police Practices

On May 1, 2000, a large May Day street demonstration was met with a forceful response from the Portland Police Bureau. The chief of police was at that time a man named Mark Kroeker, a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a conservative Christian.

In Los Angeles, as deputy chief, he had been at the forefront of introducing community policing into the force after the 1992 riots, winning him widespread praise. However, after what seemed to be overly aggressive tactics against protesters, he quickly became a target for Portland’s increasingly influential activists.

In a fairly early example of cancel culture, an alternative newspaper, the Portland Alliance, located several decade-old audio tapes in which Kroeker had, in some addresses to a Christian police organization, made disparaging comments about homosexuality and promoted several other socially conservative views from a religious perspective. This sparked outrage in local media, and was the beginning of the end for Kroeker’s tenure in Portland.

In 2002, Kroeker gave medals to two officers who were involved in the fatal shooting of a patient at a psychiatric hospital. The patient had experienced an epileptic seizure on a bus, but had been misdiagnosed.

Also in 2002, another large protest broke out — this one anti-George W. Bush — in which participants were met with pepper spray and rubber bullets. A young African American woman was shot and killed in a stop to arrest another person for outstanding warrants. The woman had jumped from the back seat into the driver’s seat, and the officer said he felt the car move while he was partially inside. Kroeker suspended, but did not fire, the officer.

It was all finally too much, and Mayor Vera Katz finally accepted Kroeker’s resignation. She denied having asked for it.

Whatever the validity of the complaints against Kroeker, it was clear future chiefs would have to pass an intense examination and be continually challenged by the media and community watchdogs. Few can withstand the scrutiny for long. Portland is now on its ninth chief of police since Kroeker’s resignation in 2003, including three women and three African Americans.

Why Unlawful Actors Run Wild

Community activists have since kept up the pressure, no doubt emboldened by successfully running Kroeker out of town. The political environment has grown increasingly hostile to the Police Bureau, in part likely due to migration of like-minded people from across the country due to Portland’s reputation as an ideological haven for leftist activism.

Under Portland’s unusual city commission form of government, the mayor directly oversees the Police Bureau. Policing tactics and procedures, as a result of that mayoral oversight, have continually been scaled back in aggressiveness.

While few would argue with the need to be sure deadly or overwhelming physical force be used only when absolutely necessary, this environment has also resulted in a hesitancy to use almost any force to protect people and property against violent protesters.

This means un-permitted protests are simply contained, even when illegal activity occurs, such as blocking streets, vandalizing property, or even street fighting. The role of the police is mostly limited to minimizing violence, which often results in increased policing against non-protesters to keep them from “provoking” protesters by doing things like walking or driving nearby.

By 2016, these demonstrations became more and more destructive. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, downtown rioters caused at least $1 million in damage over several days. The mayor at the time, Charlie Hales, cautioned protesters that walking onto freeways and blocking light rail lines is dangerous.

Also that year, during a “Don’t Shoot Portland” march, which opposed police using deadly force, blogger and photojournalist Michael Strickland pulled out his pistol when advanced on by several protesters, but did not shoot anyone. He was convicted of 20 gun charges (based on the number of protesters), sentenced to 40 days in jail, banned from owning firearms, and banned from video reporting for nearly a year.

In 2018, protesters camped out in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility just south of downtown, blocking Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees from entering. Mayor Ted Wheeler refused to allow Portland police to arrest or remove the protesters, who remained for eight days, until federal agents arrested nine of them and cleared the area.

This year, Wheeler, who has upheld the recent tradition of treating protesters with kid gloves despite vandalism, looting, and repeated violent outbursts from Antifa and local right-wing counterparts, is running for reelection. Because he did not get 50 percent of the vote in the May primary election, he will face off against the second-place finisher, Sarah Iannarone, who is perhaps best known for proclaiming “I am Antifa.”

Don’t expect changes any time soon.

Minneapolis City Council Passes Resolution to Remove and Replace Police Department,"Minneapolis City Council moved to pass a decision replacing the Minneapolis Police Department with a more publicly accountable model focused on community safety.

The resolution passed unanimously just a few weeks after George Floyd, a Minneapolis resident, was allegedly murdered by members of the Minneapolis Police Department. Since Floyd’s murder, protests and riots have erupted in Minneapolis and around the world calling for accountability in police departments as well as support for defunding the police.

The city council previously signaled its intent to disband the police department, but faced hesitation from Mayor Jacob Frey. The 12 member council, however, created a vote-proof majority that required nothing of Mayor Frey.

In the resolution, city council members declared “the intent to create a transformative new model for cultivating safety in our city.”

“The murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, by Minneapolis police officers is a tragedy that shows that no amount of reforms will prevent lethal violence and abuse by some members of the Police Department against members of our community, especially Black people and people of color,” said five of the city council members in the proposal.

The city council also voted to reconvene with a list of preliminary execution suggestions for the resolution by July 24, 2020 as well as to eliminate the emergency stay at home order that was declared because of the civil unrest.

Poll: Defunding The Police Is Now A Majority Position For Democrats,"According to a new poll by ABC News and Ipsos, a majority of Democrats now support defunding the police.

When asked the question, “Do you support or oppose the movement to ‘defund the police’?” 55 percent of Democrats said they supported it. In contrast, only 9 percent of Republicans were in favor. Overall, just under two-thirds of Americans oppose defunding the police. Independents were similarly against the movement, with 67 percent opposed.

The survey also asked respondents whether they would support “reducing the budget of the police department in your community, even if that means fewer police officers, if the money is shifted to programs related to mental health, housing, and education.” Sixty percent of all respondents were against the idea. Among Democrats, however, 59 percent supported such a change.

Respondents’ positions on defunding the police were also significantly divided by race and age. Fifty-seven percent of African-Americans said they supported the “defund the police” movement, compared with 42 percent of Hispanics and only 26 percent of whites.

Support for defunding the police also decreases with age. Of respondents aged 18-29, 46 percent were in support, compared with 42 percent of Americans aged 30-49, 26 percent of those 50-64, and 19 percent of those over 64.

Despite the shift in their party, Democratic leaders have attempted to distance themselves from the “defund the police” movement. Most significantly, the party’s presidential nominee came out against it earlier this week. A campaign spokesman said on Monday that Biden “does not believe that police should be defunded.”

Former presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris has refused to take a stance, twice answering the question of whether she supports defunding the police by vaguely describing her desire to “reimagine” American public safety.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also dodged questions on the issue, responding to the discussion with the non-answer “there are all kinds of ways that we can come at this,” and insisting “let’s not get into these questions that may be from the small minds of some, as far as safety is concerned.”

As a majority of Democratic voters are now in favor of the “defund the police” movement, however, Democratic leaders may be pressured to change their tune. If they do, Biden would have to reconcile such a radical position with his long history of law enforcement ties. In 1994, Biden helped create the crime bill that earned him the nickname “Architect of Mass Incarceration” from Sen. Cory Booker.

Scenes in Minnesota have already shown what can happen to Democratic politicians who don’t give in to chants of “defund the police.” Progressive Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was booed out of a protest for refusing to completely endorse the movement.

As Election Day approaches, the Democratic Party will have to double down on one side of the issue or the other. And now that more than half of their voter base supports defunding the police, Biden et al. may not be able to afford the dismissive approach they’ve taken so far.

Welcome To Your New World Order: A Rundown Of Woke Insanity,"America is in the midst of a new cultural civil war that for years has been brewing under the surface as left-wing academics breed aggressively woke children now permeating throughout the nation’s mainstream institutions.

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of a Minneapolis police officer sparked the worst outbreak of civil unrest in decades, protests that grew out of demanding justice for Floyd morphed into a dark operation to fundamentally transform the nation’s psyche, convincing the people of their own inherent evil from ancestral wrongs.

Battle lines are clearly being drawn, where the radical left has offered Americans a binary choice in a false dichotomy between total submission or unrelenting exile with those opposed to the new woke world order cast out of society as unrepentant racists refusing to atone for past generations’ sins. No justice, no peace. Silence is violence. You’re either with us, or against us. There is no middle ground. Which side of history are you on?

Of course in reality, (and sanity), it’s clearly not that black and white, but if recent events show us anything, they expose that this mentality is no longer one of a fringe left-wing movement but a central tenet of our mainstream culture of what it means to make “progress.” America, according to the now only acceptable narrative, is an irredeemably racist society that was built for the sole purpose to oppress. It has never been great. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is as guilty as the slaveholders who lived more than 150 years ago.

For as long as the nation continues to go mad, purging books, movies, statues and history in its own cultural revolution launched by woke elites, The Federalist will be chronicling its destruction, updating this list with each new event in its collapse. The Federalist will also be keeping tally of those fired from lack of allegiance to the new woke overlords found here.

Immigrant-Owned Louisville Restaurant Gets Demands Letter From BLM To Improve Diversity

An immigrant-owned business in Louisville, Ky., saw protestors gather in support of the restaurant in early August after a Black Lives Matter group sent them a letter with a list of demands that included filling at least 23 percent of positions with black employees and ensuring at least 23 percent of inventory came from black retailers while providing diversity training at least twice a year.

According to the Courier-Journal, demonstrators told the restaurant owner Fernando Martinez that he “better put [the list of demands] on the door so your business is not f–d with.”

“How can I be called a bigot and a racist when my family is black? When my son is gay?” Martinez said to a crowd of supportive protestors. “I’m the proud father of a gay son, and I’m gonna fight for him against anybody.”

You Must Now Explain Why You Stand For The Anthem

Kneeling for the national anthem at sporting events to protest America as an evil and racist empire was once something a few players did on occasion. Now, it appears those who stand in respect for the nation must explain themselves.

AOC Condemns Sainted Catholic Priest As White Supremacist

Freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York complained about the presence of a statue commemorating Hawaii’s Father Damien in the halls of Capitol Hill as celebrating white supremacy.

“This is what patriarchy and white supremacist culture looks like!” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on a story posted to Instagram story. “It’s not radical or crazy to understand the influence white supremacist culture has historically had in our overall culture & how it impacts the present day.”

Father Damien however, voluntarily spent years caring for exiled patients dying of leprosy until dying of the disease himself.

Since June, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Nashville, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and New Orleans have seen homicides jump 20 percent compared to last year.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying “black lives matter,'” said John Ayala, who lost his 11-year-old grandson in a Washington D.C. shooting. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

Chris Cillizza Isn’t Actually Following American Politics

In an attempt to discredit President Trump’s patriotic parlance at a pillar of American pride near the peak of Mount Rushmore, CNN’s political editor-at-large, Chris Cillizza went line-by-line of the address and titled his piece, “The 28 most outrageous lines from Donald Trump’s Mount Rushmore speech.”

Among the lines Cillizza took issue with, was of Trump pledging to protect the iconic monument.

“I am here as your President to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated,” Trump said.

“Uh, was there some sort of movement to tear down Mount Rushmore I was unaware of or…?”

In fact, monuments to the four presidents enshrined on the mountain have been desecrated or destroyed across the country, and 44 percent of self-identifying liberals have voiced support for blowing up the mountain, an idea seemingly embraced by the Democratic Party.

The New York Times ran an op-ed on June 12 erasing any doubt that calls to “defund the police” actually mean the complete abolition of law enforcement, as if the Minneapolis City Council’s Friday vote to do just that wasn’t proof already.

As this list will later explain, the Times had previously issued an apology to readers for publishing a well-reasoned editorial by Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton arguing for Trump to “send in the troops” to quell violent riots after staff complained its publication put black employees “in danger.”

Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was kicked out of a protest in a walk of shame on June 6 even after professing his “coming to grips with” his “own brokenness” for the sin of being white standing in the center of thousands of protesters.

His crime? That he refused to promise his support for the complete abolition of the city’s police department.

“I do not support the full abolition of police,” Frey said when presented with the yes or no ultimatum.

The next day, the Minneapolis City Council announced its move to banish its police department.

Coronavirus Is Woke-Sensitive

On June 1, dozens of public health experts signed an open letter blaming white supremacy on societal illnesses applauding the protesters for combating the true pandemic without regard for the novel Wuhan coronavirus that shut down the nation causing irreparable damage in the process.

“As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risk for COVID-19 transmission… This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” they wrote.

In other words, protests are fine as long as they remain in the name of social justice. Any other form of expression however, must be banned, for public health that is. Surely that’s a convincing message to the millions of Americans forced down to food pantries because the government deemed their life’s work as non-essential, or to the families unable to say goodbye to loved ones because funerals of more than 10 people were too dangerous.

So it turns out viruses are woke-sensitive. If you are protesting against racism, you won’t get Covid-19 or spread it to others. However, If you are protesting the lockdown so you can work or open your business, you are a murderer who is selfishly spreading Covid. #science pic.twitter.com/0McBofRGtr — Rachel Campos-Duffy (@RCamposDuffy) June 7, 2020

The Party That Wants To Defund The Police Also Wants To Disarm You,"Whether “Defund the Police” actually means dismantling police departments, as it appears to in Minneapolis, or is an attempt to gaslight conservatives while neutering law enforcement, one thing is certain: The party yelling to “defund the police” is the same one that desperately wants to disarm the citizenry, rendering them utterly defenseless.

Leftists, and increasingly the Democratic mainstream, have long assured Second Amendment advocates that they simply have no need for firearms, specifically semiautomatic guns, which the left deems “assault rifles.”

Notwithstanding that rights aren’t derived from what one “needs,” particularly when the person discerning necessity is a combative third party, conservatives reject the left’s claim. Not only does the Second Amendment ensure that Americans’ right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but it is inherent within a person’s natural rights to defend himself and his property.

The Proof Is in the Looting

That principle proved true over the last few weeks, as the nation has witnessed responsible citizens defending themselves, their businesses, and the property of others with ample firepower. In one particularly notable scene, a law-abiding gun owner disarmed an apparent rioter after the rogue lefted a semiautomatic rifle from the backseat of an abandoned police car. In another, a group of men, both black and white, stood armed outside a tobacco store to protect the business from looters.

Videos of thugs beating female business owners and looting department stores prove that even when police aren’t disbanded, they can’t be everywhere. Citizens can’t always count on the boys in blue to defend them, even before the left’s efforts to cripple them. We must be able to protect ourselves.

Now, after years of 16-year-old gun “experts” and National Rifle Association opponents lecturing gun owners that the exercise of their rights is incompatible with caring about the lives of innocent school children and racial minorities, the majority of the Democratic Party also wants to take away the only method of defense they were going to leave you with. They want to defund the police.

‘Defund the Police!’

Many backtracked almost immediately, insisting that “defund the police” doesn’t really mean canceling the police, and that what we really need to do is divert resources to mental health professionals, social workers, counselors, and the like. Some seriously suggested police could be replaced with Planned Parenthood, safe illicit drug injection sites, and government-run health care.

Imagine being this wrong about human nature. https://t.co/bv6gYqsGez — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) June 10, 2020

A social worker and an abortionist won’t do you much good when an armed intruder is breaking into your home in the wee hours of the morning — and if Democrats had their way, you’d be rendered defenseless as well.

Yes, They Want Your Guns

Joe Biden will tell you “You’re full of sh-t” for suggesting Democrats want to disarm you, but the left’s disdain for the Second Amendment is undeniable. Remember “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47″? That kind of anti-firearm energy from Beto O’Rourke pervades the left’s psyche, and it was grafted into this election cycle when the former vice president warmly welcomed O’Rourke’s radical gun perspective.

“I want to make something clear,” Biden said after O’Rourke endorsed him for the Democratic nomination. “I’m going to guarantee you, this is not the last you’re seeing of this guy. You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me. You’re going to be the one who leads this effort.”

Unconstitutional anti-gun plans don’t stop with Biden and O’Rourke. The Democratic Party line calls for “common sense” gun reform — whatever that means. Sense doesn’t seem too “common” among the party of which a majority, 55 percent, support defunding the police (not diverting resources; that was a separate poll question).

Mainstream Democrats have a track record of trying to infringe upon the Second Amendment, with those talking points resurfacing most notably during political campaign grandstanding or the exploitation of isolated shootings.

How Long Until Biden Takes a Knee?

So far, most establishment Democrats have tried to rein in calls for defunding the police, fearful of voter repercussions in November if they take such an extreme position. Biden has denied support for defunding the police, insisting community policing is the way to go. But how long can the “Architect of Mass Incarceration” — Biden’s nickname courtesy of Sen. Cory Booker — last before Black Lives Matter makes him beg forgiveness for his role in the infamous 1994 crime bill? His penance in the church of the Great Awokening will surely involve decrying and defunding police.

With the majority of Democrats favoring defunding police departments, the establishment isn’t really in control. It doesn’t have a good track record of standing up to the progressive mob.

We’re talking about the same party of which its plethora of presidential contenders unanimously supported taxpayer-provided health care for illegal immigrants, that bogusly impeached the president to appease a Resistance losing its mind, that adopted a 16-year old climate extremist to appease the Green New Dealers, among incalculable other leftward lurches.

Don’t expect Democrats to suddenly become moderate now. The same party that wants your guns also wants to defund your defenders.

Don’t Rush To Judgment On The Atlanta Shooting,"The death of Rayshard Brooks at the hands of Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe is a tragedy. Brooks was discovered by police asleep behind the wheel at a Wendy’s drive through. After apparently failing a field sobriety test, officers attempted to cuff Brooks, who resisted, stole an officer’s Taser and attempted to flee while pointing and seeming to fire the Taser at Rolfe. It is a sad story of a situation that got badly out of hand, but the rush to judgment against Rolfe by many in the media is misguided.

Over Saturday night as protesters burned down the Wendy’s in question, outlets like CNN were painting the police in the worst possible light, attempting clearly to link the shooting to the outrage over the killing of George Floyd. Sometimes this took the form of straight up lying, such as CNN legal analyst Areva Martin saying Brooks was unarmed.

Ah here is the clip that I think @BlueBoxDave was talking about. This lie came courtesy of CNN legal analyst Areva Martin, someone we've written plenty about at NewsBusters https://t.co/OoMJDQUkBq pic.twitter.com/aMXgq2Iysd — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) June 14, 2020

“We now have yet another death of an unarmed African American man,” Martin says. It’s a bizarre untruth especially from a legal analyst. On Sunday another CNN guest would say that Brooks was “compliant” with police even though he clearly refuses to be handcuffed and assaults the officers before stealing the Taser.

But even those on the left who are not telling flat out lies are misrepresenting the incident in almost every way they can to poison the public’s views of the police action. “He was running away,” they say, “Tasers aren’t lethal,” they go on. What gets short if any shrift at all is that Brooks was firing a weapon at police that could incapacitate them, leaving them at Brooks’ mercy.

Police are in some sense like NFL refs; they are expected to make a decision in a split second that we can then scrutinize with endless slow motion replays. It is essentially an impossible ask and no replay booth can bring back a lost life. What makes the Brooks and Floyd killings so entirely different is time itself.

As Derek Chauvin drove his knee into George Floyd’s neck, a nearly nine-minute eternity occurred, during which time any of the officers should have saved Floyd’s life. The shooting in Atlanta could not be more different. A suspect attacks, steals a weapon, runs while aiming and possibly shooting it all in a matter of seconds. The incident is over almost before it starts.

It can be argued that the officers should have deescalated the situation, they could have simply given him a warning and told him to call an Uber, perhaps. The assumption being that this was a simple police interaction. But there is no such thing as a simple police interaction. Anytime police confront a suspect even on the most minor charge the possibility exists that the person could have warrants, could be looking at jail time, and could act accordingly.

The important thing to remember about police and the extraordinary powers we give them is that we do it because crime is inherently chaotic. The police have to play by rules; criminals by their very nature do not. This more than anything else is why kids (and some adults) have to be taught the right way to deal with police, and this goes for protestors too.

It’s pretty simple. If the police stop you just do what they say. If mistakes are made; complain about it later. The police don’t know who you are or what you are capable of doing. This does not give them a free pass when people resist, but it does put them in a dangerous and difficult situation that often leads to harm. Not only is obeying the police lawfully required, it is also the best way to keep everyone safe.

After the Boston Massacre in 1770 it was John Adams who defended the British soldiers who had fired on the angry crowd of patriots. The soldiers probably could have handled the situation better, leading to less loss of life, but Adams understood that was not the standard. He understood that the law gives those entrusted with keeping order, especially through violence, a lot of latitude on the use of force.

Six of the soldiers were acquitted, two found guilty not of murder but of manslaughter. It was a lesson for our nascent nation that taught us the value of rule of law, even when it protected the very powers the founders would soon be at war against. That is to say, no matter the righteous passions of protesters demanding police accountability, Garrett Rolfe must be tried based on the law, not based on the societal moment.

The fact of the matter is that if you are in a dark parking lot, you resist arrest, steal a cop’s Taser, point it at him and fire, there is a very good likelihood you will be shot. This is not the George Floyd case and a rush to judgment will only inflame, not soothe the mood of our angry country.

How White Privilege Theory Encourages The Destruction of Property,"Minneapolis is burning, but more shocking than the sudden plunge into chaos are the ideologues who excuse and defend the pillaging of American businesses. The frequently uttered retort, “It’s just property,” isn’t just thoughtless, it’s the expression of a doctrine that undermines property rights, one of the founding tenets of our republic.

The property damage serves to “emphasize the upside-down values of the usual order of things,” where property is a greater concern than people, writes Steven W. Thrasher in Slate. “Property destruction for social change is as American as the Boston Tea Party.”

Leave aside that these riots have led directly to more deaths, including black deaths, and the absurd idea that fighting police brutality requires burning down a Target or a family home. The false dichotomy of lives or property has far more to do with how the pillage apologists view property rights in general than any coherent calculation for how property theft and damage are saving black lives.

Thanks to privilege theory quickly taking over American discourse on race, sympathy for looters and vandals, and antipathy for cops who protect property, has nowhere to go but up. Thought leaders who buy into the rhetoric of privilege and oppression as if white privilege theory is merely an eye-opening teaching tool will only have themselves to blame when extensive property crime becomes the new normal in their cities.

As the national conversation induced by the protests rocketed from police brutality to “white privilege” and “structural oppression,” the theory that vandalism and looting can strictly be attributed to opportunism and bids for attention is increasingly implausible. A constant stream of rhetoric paints white people as oppressors of black people, pressuring observers to excuse, justify, or keep quiet about property crime for fear of showing their “privilege.”

The sympathy for looters and vandals is more than social pressure, however. It stems directly from privilege theory’s natural conclusions. Contrary to popular belief on the right, the central problem of privilege theory isn’t that privilege “doesn’t exist.” It certainly does.

The problem is the belief that the “unearned advantages” of those who are white, straight, or male means whatever they’ve earned can’t rightly be called their own. Advocates of White Privilege Theory (WPT) believe the success of privileged groups isn’t earned, it’s mortgaged. As I wrote in 2018:

White guilt is white debt, [Eula Bliss] argues. We feel guilty because we haven’t paid it off. We feel guilty not because we personally have behaved in a racist manner, but because we’ve indirectly benefited from this country’s history of very real oppression, though we have participated in none of it: slavery, Jim Crow laws, and racist housing policies chief among them. ‘I’m more compelled by a freedom that would allow me to deserve what I have,’ writes Bliss, ‘call it liberation, maybe. If debt can be repaid incrementally, resulting eventually in ownership, perhaps so can guilt.’

As long as people are participating in a system that privileges them over other races, their benefits are undeserved and unowned. It follows that they shouldn’t have any “rights” to whatever property their unfair advantage has allowed them to claim.

If the invalid beneficiaries of capitalism can’t really “own” property, then looting a coffee shop is just a “repossession,” a direct wealth transfer back to the people who “really earned it” or deserve it. It’s like having a car you’ve skipped payments on — you don’t have the right to complain about something you don’t own being repossessed. Thus, we arrive at the mantra, “It’s just property.”

The redistributive rationale for looting isn’t new, even if WPT is. That’s all the more reason to be wary of privilege theory’s influence — it fits neatly within long-standing Marxist ideology. Academics have long recognized that property crime is more than an expression of blind rage or the unleashing of man’s depravity.

Rather, as Olga Khazan writes in The Atlantic, one can draw a conclusion from a 1968 study that widespread looting could be “interpreted as a kind of mass protest against our dominant conceptions of property… in it, we see a bid for [its] redistribution.” Others, Khazan notes, have seen looting, such as that in Ferguson, Missouri in 2015, as “retribution for the economic exploitation of black communities.”

A deep-seated hatred of “bourgeois property” colors leftist retorts to complaints about smashing, torching, and vandalizing commercial zones. True believers of WPT (as opposed to those retweeting #privilege memes and woke apologies) don’t just want you to apologize for your privilege—they want to overthrow the system they blame for generating and maintaining oppression: capitalism.

“Capitalism is a system that breeds class oppression and national/racial conquest,” wrote sociologist Edna Bonacich. “I believe that you cannot attack racism without attacking capitalism, and you cannot attack capitalism without attacking racism.”

The indictment of other minorities who seem to benefit from capitalism further exposes the anti-capitalist roots of privilege theory, and it’s consistent with the pillaging of minority-owned and white-owned stores alike. Where conservatives might point to immigrant entrepreneurs as evidence minorities can “pick themselves up by their own bootstraps,” Bonacich sees them as “middlemen” oppressors, “oppressing those beneath them for the benefit of those above.”

Hatred of police vastly disproportionate to the level of police brutality actually experienced also fits the anti-capitalist modus operandi. From the Marxist point of view, police — who defend the capitalist system with force — are even more guilty than the capitalists themselves. As Thrasher explained in his Slate article defending the burning of a police precinct, “The real looting is happening with wealth transfers towards the ruling class, and endured police intimidation and abuse to do it.”

Most Americans don’t believe capitalism should be completely overthrown, likely including most people expressing solidarity with Black Lives Matter. But while promoting WPT may help some people realize it’s harder to be black in America than to be white, buying into the theory’s full conclusions, many others are going to do what the memes and blue checkmark elites tell them to do: “educate” themselves.

A Google-driven education on WPT will lead them directly to the understanding that unearned advantages mean the system is inherently unfair, and whatever a privileged person possesses may be repossessed by those who need or deserve it more: the poor and racial minorities.

Maintaining the integrity of property rights doesn’t just require adequate policing. We must treat privilege theory as a threat to the American promise — not equal outcomes and wealth, but equal opportunity. We have a long way to go in fulfilling that promise, but adopting white privilege theory will not help us get there.

"How Defunding The Police Endangers Lives, Liberty, And Property","Intimidated by an increasingly loud minority of the U.S. population, city councils across America are considering “defunding” their police forces. Such a proposal would have been dismissed as unconscionable not so long ago. Now, in the wake of George Floyd’s death, it’s being debated, in varying degrees, in cities from Dallas, to Chico, to Denver.

Lest the calls to “defund the police” be dismissed as hyperbolic, overheated posturing, The New York Times recently ran an op-ed by Project NIA director Mariame Kaba explicitly stating, “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police.” Leading the way is Minneapolis, whose City Council voted to replace the city’s police department with a vague and undefined “community-led public safety system.” At least we got a heads’ up.

Law-abiding ladies and gentlemen: now might be the time pack up and get out of Dodge — while you still have something left to take with you.

We Need Government to Defend Our Most Vital Rights

The Declaration of Independence proclaims the government of the United States was formed to secure our unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It further states the right to organize a government in a manner “most likely to effect” the “Safety and Happiness” of its citizens. Without protections for these natural rights, little else in society matters, and all other activities of the state, no matter how well-intentioned or seemingly benign, are irrelevant and trivial.

The words penned by Thomas Jefferson were carefully chosen. While the Founders sought a new government with a higher priority on individual liberty than ever before, they knew they wanted a government. They did not declare the founding of an anarchist enclave, free of any mechanisms of the state. Any government, at its most minimal, must protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness or it is not worthy to wield the sole legitimate use of force granted by the consent of a free people.

John Locke argues citizens form a consensual social compact to protect life, liberty, and estate (property) to escape the perilous state of nature that exists without government. Well, we’re getting a real-world look at that state of nature now. It isn’t pretty.

Even a Night-watchman State Still Needs a Watchman

There remains a large amount of disagreement across the political spectrum on the size and scope of government. Do we truly need the state mucking about in education, agriculture, environmental issues, telecommunications, and health care? How large should our military spending be? Is there a better way to handle Social Security?

Yet, until recently, except for Rothbardian “anarcho-capitalists” and Antifa-aligned far-left anarchists, one uniting point of agreement was the need for government law enforcement. “Minarchist” libertarians also concede the government must hold a monopoly on the use of force. In his award-winning Anarchy, State, and Utopia, Robert Nozick argues a “minimal state” is justified insofar as it is “limited to the narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud” and the “enforcement of contracts.”

Nineteenth-century Britain is viewed as a shining example of a “night-watchman” polity, the closest the world has come to a successful and prosperous “minimal state” in the last 800 years (Medieval Iceland went even further). By the late 1840s, Britain was one of the freest nations in the world. It promoted the abolition of slavery, free-trade, and free enterprise. A “hands-off” approach was taken to nearly every facet of life within its realm except one: security.

As free, laissez-faire, and liberty-focused as the last night-watchman state was, 19th-century British rulers accepted the vital and non-negotiable need to maintain law and order via government institutions in order to protect the life and property of Britons.

During the Pax Britannica, local police enforced laws and ordinances. Courts adjudicated disputes between subjects, ensured contracts were faithfully executed, and saw that justice would be served when laws were broken. A trim, efficient army of roughly 200,000 troops maintained peace across an Empire spanning a quarter of the globe while the Royal Navy patrolled the sea lanes, promoted the safe flow of goods, and hunted down slavers. “To serve and protect” was, in essence, the modus operandi of the British Empire’s political apparatus.

The Absence of Law and Order Invites Crime, Then Poverty

Property rights combined with faith that law and order will be enforced are the key to building prosperous communities. Historian Amity Shlaes reminds us: “One of the great tragedies of the 1960s riots was the subsequent withdrawal of retail shops, already somewhat scarce, from inner cities. Their departure left the inhabitants with nowhere to shop. For poorer citizens, riots worsened what urban renewal had begun.”

Poverty is not the mother of crime — crime is the mother of poverty, and, in turn, urban decay. What new business owner should spend his life savings on opening a business in a neighborhood where it cannot be reasonably assumed to be safe from arson, theft, or vandalism? What parents of young teens would not leave a threatening, violence-riddled community the moment they get the means to move elsewhere?

When police aren’t supported by mayors and city councils, when they aren’t allowed to do their jobs, the ripple effect is real and tragic. When firefighters or emergency medical teams cannot be assured of their safety, they can’t put out burning buildings, rescue people in trouble, or save those on the verge of dying. Most recently, many truckers have announced they won’t deliver food and other goods to cities that defund police. No one should be surprised.

As economist Thomas Sowell explains in his book Economic Facts and Fallacies:

Detroit did not have a massive riot [in 1967] because it was an economic disaster area. It became an economic disaster area after the riots, as did black neighborhoods in many other cities across the country. Moreover, riot-torn neighborhoods in these cities remained disaster areas for decades thereafter, as businesses became reluctant to locate there, reducing access to both jobs and places to shop, and both black and white middle-class people left for the suburbs.

Without a fully funded and supported police force, who will answer the call of a frightened student who thinks she’s being stalked on the way home from class? Who will respond to home invasions? Robberies? Threats of violence? Rampaging fires?

Beginning with ending the corrupting effect of unions, many police reforms merit consideration. But the solution isn’t to abolish police departments, it’s strengthening them in the right ways. As I wrote last year:

A large, disciplined, and respected police force is needed to stabilize broken communities long enough for law-abiding citizens to feel it is safe enough to return. Constant outreach between police and those they serve is integral to any progress. Residents should know the name of the officers on their neighborhood beat on a first-name basis. Abusive police behavior should be addressed immediately. Both policemen and citizens should be happy to see each other. Building trusting relationships between police and the communities they protect takes time, but it is a worthwhile investment.

By our very nature, we desire many things in life. We crave friendship. We need outlets for our gifts and skills. We seek time to reflect and contemplate higher things. None of these noble pursuits can be engaged, however, if our safety remains unsecured. Man cannot pursue the Good if he’s constantly looking over his shoulder, afraid that harm may come his way at any moment.

Yes, the U.S. government has far too much power and influence over our lives. Ideally, an American citizen should be able to go for long stretches of time without having to step foot in a government building, fill out a government form, or interact with an official of the state.

But we need our police. We need the innumerable good cops who daily lay their lives on the line to serve and protect the defenseless and endangered. Most of all, we must demand the government continue to do the one thing it is supposed to do — protect our life, our liberty, and our pursuit of happiness.

"No, Camden, New Jersey Didn't Eliminate Police. It Increased Them","Proponents of defunding or disbanding police departments are lauding Camden, New Jersey, as a model for the nation. They suggest that the rapid decline in the city’s crime since it disbanded its police department in 2012 proves the merits of their position.

We can discern the truth by analyzing the policies Camden implemented after it disbanded its police department and measuring how well they worked.

It bears noting up front that in spite of the heartening declines in crime rates Camden has achieved since 2012, it remains one of the most dangerous cities in America. Its violent crime rate in 2019 was eight times that of New Jersey’s overall rate of violent crime, the highest rate by far of any city in a state with several high-crime urban centers. Yet this qualifies as progress. Last year marked the lowest-crime year in Camden in decades.

Proudly labeling Camden’s transformation as the result of disbanding its police force would be to tell less than half the story. Rather, Camden reorganized and grew its police force.

Camden Didn’t Exactly ‘Defund the Police’

In 2012, facing spiraling crime rates and fiscal strains stemming in part from its unionized police force, Camden dissolved its force to replace it with a then-nonunionized county police force that, as described in a 2014 Governing exposè, “rehired most of the laid-off cops, along with nearly 100 other officers, but at much lower salaries and with fewer benefits than they had received from the city.” Camden’s “disbanding” can really be thought of as a technical transition from a city to a county police department.

In 2011, amid budget cuts, Camden’s police force had reportedly dwindled to 175 officers, charged with protecting a city of more than 75,000. As few as 12 cops were on patrol at times. Subsequent to the reorganization, Camden had more than 400 officers, providing it one of the highest police presences on a per-capita basis of any large U.S. city.

Camden neither disbanded its police force, nor did it defund it. On the contrary, as Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki recently told Tapinto Camden: “As far as the change that has taken place, the number one difference is resources.”

Indeed, the Camden County Police Department (CCPD) has received ample resources, including tens of millions of dollars per year. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, from the time the CCPD emerged, it received substantially more funds than originally budgeted. Its budget has only grown, today costing more than $68 million per year. By contrast, Paterson, another high-crime New Jersey city with a population nearly double Camden’s, estimates its annual police budget at $45 million.

Camden has used the funding not just to beef up the police force, but to equip it with sophisticated crime-fighting technology. As Matt Taibbi detailed in a December 2013 feature for Rolling Stone, Camden installed a massive surveillance apparatus, replete with more than 100 high-tech cameras covering the entire city, a mobile 30-foot patrol crane, dozens of microphones for identifying gunshot locations to within a few meters and pointing cameras to escape routes, and “Minority Report-style” scanners for reading license plates and generating warnings. Even civilians work as crime analysts to “patrol” the city virtually and direct uniformed officers from a robust command center.

In short, Camden today has more police — including many of its original officers — who operate using pervasive surveillance equipment likely to give civil libertarians pause. Moreover, presumably contrary to the desires of the defunders, the force consists of a significantly smaller percentage of minority police than did its predecessor.

Camden Police Haven’t Been Without Incident

Defunders will likely chafe at the suggestion that the policies chronicled above comport with their vision of policing. They will, however, point positively to Camden’s policy reforms. Camden has embraced the concept of “community policing.” This includes more cops walking the beat and interacting regularly with Camden residents, as well as far more restrictive use-of-force guidelines and de-escalatory training. In recent days, numerous profiles have covered these policing practices favorably. Evidence is thus far inconclusive as to the effectiveness of such policies in reducing crime.

While the city claims its policies have led to a dramatic reduction in complaints, from a state-high 65 in 2012 to three in 2019, the force has been implicated in alleged malfeasance. One particularly gruesome case is now pending against Camden County and several officers over a 2014 arrest that resulted in Xavier Ingram being rendered a quadriplegic.

Police pursued Ingram over suspicion that he had ditched a gun after departing from a group the police believed to be engaged in drug activity. The police chased Ingram, and he fell. In spite of claims that he was not resisting, police subdued him — allegedly with enough force to break his neck. Ingram was charged on gun possession and drug charges, which his lawyers dispute.

Discovery in Ingram’s lawsuit showed that during an 18-month period from 2013-2014, Camden dismissed practically every complaint against the CCPD, including virtually all of the 100-plus use-of-force complaints, while department-issued complaints were regularly sustained.

To be clear, anecdotal examples of alleged abuses of power, including this pending case, and complaint statistics are not dispositive in judging a police department. But the defunders might well do so on this basis, were they aware of such evidence.

Meanwhile, it would seem the city has also embraced policies that might be more aptly described as “broken windows” policing, again likely to the chagrin of defunders. The American Civil Liberties Union has previously criticized the CCPD for increasing enforcement of low-level offenses. The city has also spent millions of dollars razing hundreds of blighted buildings that often served as hubs of criminal activity.

Camden has likely benefited over time from criminal incarceration and the deterrence that follows from improved policing. Camden’s reforms also come against a backdrop of economic growth and improved educational outcomes.

What Do the Statistics Say?

What has happened to Camden’s crime rates since the reorganization of its police department?

It is undeniable that Camden has witnessed a significant reduction in both overall and violent crime between 2013 when the CCPD came on the beat, and 2019. A CCPD-provided crime report obtained by the author shows that during this period, Camden experienced a 38 percent drop in overall crime and a 40 percent drop in violent crime.

These numbers, on their face, are significant. But with such data, we must always ask, “Compared to what?” To evaluate the strides made by the CCPD, one must weigh its change in crime rates against those of the state in which it is situated, and cities similarly riddled with crime.

To make these comparisons, the author conducted a preliminary analysis based on New Jersey’s uniform crime reports, which are consistent with the numbers reported in the FBI uniform crime reports, but differ slightly from the CCPD’s (this may have occurred due to the CCPD’s reclassification of crimes and other factors).

Since New Jersey published only quarterly data for 2019 and the FBI has not published corresponding final data for that year, and because Camden’s greatest decline in crime since the reorganization of its police unit in 2013 occurred during 2018, it is most appropriate to look at 2013-2018 crime rates 1) statewide, 2) for Camden, and 3) among the five other cities New Jersey has historically classified as its “major urban” centers: Elizabeth, Jersey City, Newark, Paterson, and Trenton. These have typically been among the highest-crime areas in the state.

What are the findings? Between 2013 and 2018, New Jersey experienced a 25 percent reduction in overall crime and a 27 percent drop in violent crime. Camden experienced a 32 percent reduction in overall crime and 35 percent drop in violent crime.

Beating the state average is a good start. But was Camden the best performer of its peer group? No.

Newark experienced a 45 percent reduction in both overall crime and violent crime during this period. Interestingly, there has been no such clamoring for police across the nation to emulate the Newark Police Department. So too, Paterson and Jersey City each experienced declines in violent crime within 4 percent of Camden’s, albeit with smaller reductions in overall crime.

While the defunders are squarely focused on the CCPD’s performance post-2012, it is also clarifying to look at crime statistics over a longer period. Between 2000 and 2018, New Jersey experienced a 48 percent reduction in overall crime and a 44 percent reduction in violent crime. Camden’s overall crime rate fell by 43 percent and its violent crime rate by only 22 percent. That is, it lagged behind the rest of the state’s improvements, particularly regarding violent crime. It also lagged behind several of its peers. Newark, Jersey City, and Trenton all experienced greater reductions than Camden in both overall and violent crime during this period.

Don’t Jump to Conclusions

Two points ought to be made here. First, New Jersey in general and its cities in particular have followed the overall national trend of declining violent crime that we have been blessed to enjoy in America at a pronounced rate since the 1990s. This trend was the result of policies that defunders seem willing to toss out overnight, irrespective of their benefits to societal peace and prosperity.

Second, Camden’s more recent gains may reflect a catching up of sorts to its peers, though again, the relatively superior performance of Newark is striking. No two cities are alike, and we ought to be careful in drawing conclusions over relatively short time periods. But those heralding Camden’s policies as a panacea ought to consider the full context.

A prudent analysis must factor in not just the disbanding of the department, or its shift to community policing, but the increasing number of cops on the streets, the equipping of the police force with better tools, the residual effects of removing violent criminals from the streets over time, the potential deterrent effect of its superior police force, economic growth, and educational improvements, to name just a few factors. It must also consider crime reductions on a relative basis to determine if Camden has found the “secret sauce” of policing.

After conducting such an analysis, to the extent it holds true that Camden has implemented reforms that have uniquely reduced crime, its policies should be adopted wholeheartedly. But we should be skeptical of claims not grounded in rigorous analysis, particularly in the throes of tumult.

The Rayshard Brooks Case Is Not Another George Floyd Incident,"In the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, the subject of racism and police brutality lept to the forefront of our political discourse. While both are important matters to explore and discuss, the fact is that such debate is not being held in an honest fashion. Instead, a chosen narrative has become more important than fact. Worse, there is an intentional effort to conflate even the most dissimilar events in order to promote the political aims of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The reaction to the death of Rayshard Brooks is an example of this conflation. On June 12, police officers were called to a Wendy’s restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Brooks had “fallen asleep in his vehicle, which was parked in the drive-through, causing other customers to drive around him.”

After an initially civil interaction involving an alcohol test, Officers Devin Brosnan and Garrett Rolfe attempted to arrest Brooks. As they tried to place him in handcuffs, Brooks violently resisted arrest and grappled with the officers. He seized a Taser from Brosnan, punched Rolfe, then fled the scene after being hit by a Taser dart fired by Rolfe.

While running, Brook turned and fired the Taser in Rolfe’s direction, with Rolfe returning fire with his handgun. Brooks died later in hospital care.

According to Section 3010 the Atlanta Police Department’s Standard Operating Procedures, the actions the officers took were clearly within departmental guidelines. The relevant portion states that an employee may use deadly force to apprehend a suspected felon only when:

He or she reasonably believes that the suspect possesses a deadly weapon or any object, device, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury and when he or she reasonably believes that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others…

Regardless of Brooks’s culpability for his own death as the result of his violent actions, the underlying narrative of systematic and racist police brutality apparently remains more powerful than incontrovertible video evidence.

The officer has been fired, and Police Chief Erika Shields has stepped down. Yet Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece, stated, “Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male. This time it landed on our front doorstep.”

Brooks was clearly not unarmed, however, but attempted to use a stolen weapon after violently resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. This alone sets Brooks apart from Floyd, whose death occurred while posing no threat to the officers involved.

Allowing two disparate scenarios to be compared by nature of skin color alone harms the worthwhile cause of raising awareness of police brutality by making the implicit claim that the use of force against every black man by police is unjust.

The unfortunate and brutal fact is that some people are killed without adequate justification by the police in appalling and morally abhorrent situations, while others are killed within the context of self-defense. Each case involves individual humans and their individual choices, and so, each case should be judged according to its own facts and merits. To apply subjective assumptions of innocence or guilt based on skin color is both dangerous and fundamentally racist.

What makes matters worse is that there is a growing attempt to justify the act of resisting arrest by making the unsubstantiated claim that black Americans run a heightened risk of being killed in such scenarios. Attorney L. Chris Stewart stated, “People ask, ‘Why would (Brooks) resist if they’re trying to put him in handcuffs?’ Well, they put George Floyd in handcuffs, and he was subsequently killed. So just getting put in handcuffs — if you’re African American — doesn’t mean you’re going to be nicely taken to the back of a police car.”

If we begin to justify violent actions against police officers who follow the law, we are open the door to lawlessness and anarchy.

By conflating contrasting cases as evidence of a narrative with a complete disregard for facts or nuance, we are making it impossible for police officers to do their jobs. Indeed, by justifying violence against officers, we should not be surprised when many decide that placing their lives on the line daily is hardly worth the risk. When that day comes, will the chosen narrative remain as important as reality? Let’s hope we don’t have to find out.

Maybe It’s Time To Privatize The Police,"On Wednesday Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe was formally charge with felony murder in the killing of Rayshard Brooks. While evading arrest after having assaulted Rolfe and his partner, Brooks points a Taser at Rolfe and fires. At that point, and exactly that point Rolfe takes out his gun and shoots. If this act of self-defense by a cop is felony murder, then we need to take a hard look at what the police are in today’s American society and what we wish them to be.

Traditionally the badge gives law enforcement officers wider latitude than it gives a regular citizen in using violence to prevent crime and physical harm. We offer this wider latitude because when police use violence they do so on behalf of society, not in furtherance of their own individual interests. We understand that the chaotic nature of crime will inevitably put police in untenable situations and since most of us don’t want to deal with crime ourselves, we offer legal support, as well as good pay and benefits to those willing to do the job for us.

But in the case of Rolfe, the Atlanta District Attorney Paul Howard does not appear to give the police officer any wider latitude based on his job, much the opposite in fact. The DA has almost nothing to say about the fact that Brooks resisted arrest, attacked police, stole a weapon and fired it at them. At one point Howard referred to Brooks’ behavior as “jovial.” The message is that Brooks’ actions were irrelevant to the situation. Rolfe should have been counting Taser shots and known in those split seconds that the person firing a weapon at him actually posed no threat.

If this is the new standard, if we are not going to give police wider latitude, if we are going to strip them of qualified immunity, then we are basically treating them like anyone else with a gun. That being the case it makes more sense for us to consider the privatization of the police than to pretend they are officers of the government with special protections. If we demand that police enter dangerous situations but tell them if something goes wrong its all on them, not on the society they serve, then police are in an impossible position.

Privatizing the police force would solve this problem. And for many progressives it also has the advantage of being the inevitable outcome of their goal to abolish police. Communities could simply hire private police who are subject to the same laws as anyone else. They also could not be required to enter dangerous situations so there would be no reason for them to have special legal protections.

The downside to this plan of course is that poor communities might just go un-policed, but then again that would end police brutality in those areas. But the big upside is that we could finally hold those who enforce the law fully accountable. We would no longer be forcing cops to put their lives on the line for us and therefore we would have no responsibility to grant them any legal protections.

Instead of policing being an oppressive tool of the state, it would be a matter for individuals and communities to deal with themselves. Without special rules and protections private police will be more likely to simply ignore crime than get involved in violent complicated situations that could end badly.

The system of policing we have used until now has worked, it has reduced violent crime, it has kept most of our communities safe, but inherent to that system is that police officers are a unique and protected class of individuals when violence occurs. Taking away those protections breaks an essential social contract with police. Once that contract is broken we have no right to compel them to enter dangerous situations.

The fact of the matter is that most of the plans put forward from abolishing, defunding, to reforming the police involving stripping away protections for them, and undermining their ability to be protected by their union leadership. Fine. But if being a cop is no different than being anyone else with a gun then like anyone else with a gun police should be free to decline to intervene in dangerous situations.

I don’t like the idea of armies of George Zimmermans in the employ of gated communities keeping the peace. I would prefer to keep the traditional system in which policing is a function of the state that confers on the police protections and immunities. But asking the police to do that job without such protections and immunities leaves them in a no-win position. If that is where this is going, then we are better off with private police forces that can decide for themselves when the danger is worth it.

The Anti-Police Rioters Finally Got Me To Buy My First Gun,"I bought a gun last weekend. It’s not a purchase I wanted to make, and I pray I never have to use it, but with mayhem recently engulfing cities across the United States, I and many others are biting the bullet and purchasing firearms.

Mine is a Springfield 9mm — something small enough to fit in my nightstand or under my driver’s seat should I have to visit one of America’s many war-torn cities. But it’s powerful enough to do the job.

I’ve pondered the purchase for years but always found a reason to put it off. The carnage that has rocked the country over the last couple of weeks, however, sealed the deal. After all, I have a duty to protect my family as best I can, and when the government’s protections begin to break down, a firearm becomes my only option.

It’s not that I have anything against guns — quite the opposite. I’m a big believer in the Second Amendment and have defended Americans’ right to bear arms in writing. But guns were such a fixture of my youth that, like a kid forced by overzealous parents to play baseball year after year, I walked away at my first opportunity.

My father was an independent gun dealer who had me shooting my Chipmunk rifle at four years old, and my mom’s second husband was an avid hunter and gun collector. By the time I was 17, I had shot nearly every gun imaginable, from derringer and Desert Eagle pistols to SKS rifles.

I suppose I enjoyed it all at one point, but it’s been 20 years since I fired a live round. I will be heading to the range this week to correct that error.

I Can’t Count on Anyone Else to Protect Me

I seriously doubt I will get the same trigger rush as my gun-loving friends, but I’m not in this for the thrills. Knowing that if someone kicks in my door I have a fighting chance of defending my home is well worth an arduous hour or so at the range. In fact, I have come to view it as my civic responsibility as I witness, in real time, the unraveling of the societal structures that are supposed to ensure our safety.

For years, liberal politicians and their public relations officers in the mainstream media have attempted to repeal the constitutional right to bear arms protected by the Bill of Rights. We were told our juvenile fantasies of protecting ourselves from a tyrannical government were laughable, given the advanced technology of the U.S. military. You know, all that “What good is a rifle against a fighter jet?” nonsense.

But that’s an absurd framing of the issue, done purposely to deflect from the real reason gun owners so passionately cling to their Second Amendment rights: the gross incompetence of their respective local governments.

That incompetence has been abetted by liberal politicians and pundits who, while trying to strip Americans of their right to protect themselves, also demonized American law enforcement by obsessing over and flooding the media with extremely rare incidents of police brutality. They also, of course, ignored the heroic stories of cops risking their lives to save others.

The tragic combination of these two efforts is now playing itself out on the national stage as cities across the country grant license to mobs of looters and rioters, grifting on the heels of the horrific murder of George Floyd and wreaking havoc on minority communities. The predictable result: cities full of sitting ducks in the throes of national turmoil. Thus far, my town has remained immune from such insanity, but the way this madness is spreading, I fear it’s only a matter of time.

As Police Presence Goes Down, Gun Sales Go Up

The nation’s most iconic newspaper is publishing op-eds calling for the dismantling of police departments across the country. While such thinking was previously confined to America’s most liberal enclaves, it has gained footholds in mid-America cities such as Denver and Nashville.

All the while, violence goes unchecked because America’s police forces either have been ordered to stand down or are paralyzed by the fear that if they do their jobs, the media will ruin their lives. Whatever the reason, I can no longer rely on the government for my safety, and every bad guy in America knows it. Sadly, the left’s concerted campaign against America’s cops is dangerously close to taking them down.

But there’s a silver lining: As America’s cities continue spiraling out of control, millions of Americans like me are exercising their rights and purchasing firearms, thus undoing decades of work by the left to restrict the gun rights of Americans. According to Business Insider:

Federal background checks increased 75% in May compared with 2019, a further acceleration from April’s 69% gain over the previous year, according to Cowen research. Handguns, in particular, were up 94%. Background checks are largely considered a proxy for gun purchases in the absence of more granular sales data.

With weak mayors and powerless police, we have little choice but to take our safety into our own hands.

"Shootings, Violence Jump In Cities Where Mayors Have Restrained Police","Activist campaigns against police to have accelerated in the wake of a violent altercation between police and George Floyd that prefaced his death. In response, mayors of several cities have reduced police presence. This has led in several cases to dramatic increases in violent crime.

Seattle

Since violent protests against police have begun, there have been numerous reports of shootings occurring in Seattle and the six-block Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone over the last few days.

One protestor named Jake Scheels inadvertently caught a shooting on camera. In one moment, Scheels can be seen describing life in the CHAZ while he plays frisbee and walks around the area. A neighborhood overtaken by gun-toting anti-police vigilantes, CHAZ is also known as Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, or CHOP.

https://www.facebook.com/jake.scheels/videos/10158069910340590/

“Look it, it’s being resolved peacefully,” he says. “Peacefully. Peacefully. No one is going to f-cking jail. There’s nothing to be afraid of down here at the CHOP.”

Just seconds later, Scheels is seen walking his car as protestors around him scatter, screaming, and gunshots ring out.

“It’s getting a little wild down here now,” he says. He continues once he is in his car with, “Dude, there’s f-cking gunshots. I’m out of here.” He later returns to the scene and begins describing the suspected shooter to the camera.

According to a statement released by the Seattle Police Department, officers also responded to a shooting in the CHAZ early Saturday morning but “were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers safe access to the victims.”

Footage from security cameras and officers’ body cameras during the incident was later released and shows officers attempting to push past protestors to respond to the report of a shooting in the area.

“Please move out of the way so we can get to the victim. All we are trying to do is get to the victim and provide them aid,” says one officer.

According to CNN, “a later clip shows police leaving as members of the public continue to yell at them.”

The victims were eventally both transported to the hospital, where one died of his injuries. Protestors in the CHAZ are now calling for the shooter(s) to turn themselves in. According to CNN, one protestor even suggested the police would treat the shooter better than other protestors might.

“Turn yourself in, because if you don’t … it’s better that the police get hold of you than they do,” they said.

Minneapolis

Earlier this week, at least eight people in Minneapolis were shot. According to CBS 4 Minnesota, “the Minneapolis Police Department says it’s investigating five separate incidents” and no arrests have been made yet.

This comes shortly after the Minneapolis City Council voted to replace the police department with social programming. The resolution passed unanimously just a few weeks after Floyd, a Minneapolis resident, was allegedly killed by members of the Minneapolis Police Department.

Another shooting, one of the most violent in Minneapolis’s history, according to the Star Tribune, wounded 11 people and killed another on Sunday. A suspect has yet to be arrested and Minneapolis Police has “been in touch with FBI officials in the Twin Cities.”

“We have seen unfortunately in the past several months an uptick in violent crime in Minneapolis, and we are certainly doing our best to address that,” said Police Chief Medaria Arradondo. “This is going to take more than just the Minneapolis Police Department.”

State Rep. Pat Garofalo tweeted about the rising violence in Minneapolis, stating his disgust with the whole situation.

https://mobile.twitter.com/PatGarofalo/status/1274703562052964352

“In Minneapolis during the last 24 hours, 19 people have been shot.19,” he wrote. “As distressing as that is, consider the fact that the Minneapolis City Council wants to reduce the number of cops in Minneapolis. This public safety crisis is spiraling out of control.”

New York City

ABC 7 in New York City reported that more than 22 people were shot over the weekend as police presence continues to decrease by order of the mayor.

“We are going to put more and more resources into the Cure Violence movement and the Crisis Management System, which has proven to be extraordinarily effective in stopping gun violence before it happens and mediating conflicts,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier.

According to Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, there was “an increase of 25 percent in homicides in the last few days,” but city still plans to use its Cure Violence movement instead of police to mitigate gun violence.

Chicago

According to NBC 5 Chicago, more than 50 people were shot this weekend with at least eight fatalities reported. Many of the shootings have resulted in no one in custody.

This comes just a few weeks after this year’s Memorial Day weekend, which was the most violent weekend in Chicago’s history. According to the Chicago Sun Times, more than 85 people were wounded in shootings and 25 other people died that weekend.

“We’ve never seen anything like it at all,” said Max Kapustin, the senior research director at the crime lab told the Sun Times of the increase in shootings after rioters poured into the streets with anger at police. “I don’t even know how to put it into context. It’s beyond anything that we’ve ever seen before.”

"BLM Doesn't Care About All Black Lives, Just The Few Ended By Police","Positing that “Black Lives Matter” is such an obvious fact that repeating it sounds banal. Only an outright racist would question this premise. Therefore, the frequent “All Lives Matter” retort of critics often inflames the sensibilities of activists, with many in the BLM movement find this assertion objectionable on the basis that it misinterprets their message. The phrase “Black Lives Matter” is not a declaration that other lives are unimportant, activists say, but an affirmation that black lives are worth protecting.

Activists usually invoke the controversial killings of black men by the police to argue that black lives are treated as insignificant in America. But while footage depicting black men shot by police may draw raw emotions, such cases are extremely rare.

Although protesting police brutality is entirely legitimate, the BLM movement is built on the specious claim that as a result of systemic racism, black men are disproportionately killed by the police. So, by mischaracterizing the problem as “systemic racism,” the BLM movement will ultimately fail in its pursuit to save black lives.

Let’s Be Honest About ‘Systemic Racism’

The BLM movement could be an effective force for police reform, but activists wrongly direct their anger at eliminating the element of “systemic racism” they say permeates police departments, despite the lack of data implicating its existence. Several studies have shown that the claim of widespread racism in law enforcement is baseless. For instance, a study published by Harvard economist Roland Fryer found that black Americans are less likely to be shot by police when compared to their Caucasian counterparts, even when black Americans wield weapons.

To some skeptics, this may not be enough to disprove systemic racism. Cynics postulate if police officers could get away murdering black Americans without facing the consequences, then they would do so. Yet in the article “The Reverse Racism Effect: Are Cops More Hesitant to Shoot Black Than White Suspects?” researchers show that due to trepidation stemming from possible legal and social consequences, police officers are more circumspect when deciding to shoot black suspects than Caucasians. This, in turn, leads to fewer mistakes and slower response times in a simulated policing environment. If racism is rampant in the police force, why would officers refuse to act on this impulse in real-life situations because they fear the resulting implications, then act on it under simulated conditions when they can kill blacks with impunity?

Yet even if black Americans were disproportionately killed by police, would this be evidence of systemic racism? Contrary to the speculations of activists, research suggests the answer is “no.” In an article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found “no evidence of anti-black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-white officers.’’

The study, however, further notes that “as the proportion of violent crime committed by black civilians increased, a person fatally shot was more likely to be black.” Similar trends were also reported for Hispanics. It can reasonably be concluded the greater likelihood of black Americans being killed by officers is a result of their higher level of exposure incidents involving police.

Police Killings of Unarmed Black Men Are Extremely Rare

Despite the moral indignation of activists, there is no logical justification for so many of their beliefs. Even when we are discussing the matter of extrajudicial killings, the evidence suggests that American police kill very few unarmed individuals. According to the database of the Washington Post, only 15 unarmed black Americans were killed in 2019. The figure for Caucasians was only slightly higher. Additionally, unarmed does not mean non-violent — even a suspect who physically attacks a police officer is classified as unarmed.

The argument that black Americans are inordinately killed by the police when accounting for their size in the population is also fallacious. Although they are only 13 percent of the population, the fact remains that black Americans are responsible for a much higher percentage of homicides in America relative to their share of the population.

In a recent article, researcher Heather Macdonald aptly describes the extensive involvement of blacks in crime: “Between 2012 and 2015, blacks committed 85.5 percent of all black-white interracial victimizations (excluding interracial homicide, which is also disproportionately black-on-white). That works out to 540,360 felonious assaults on whites. Whites committed 14.4 percent of all interracial violent victimization or 91,470 felonious assaults on blacks.”

If major players in the BLM movement care about black lives, then they ought to focus on reforms that can improve the quality of life for black Americans. Presently, several activists have been recommending that states defund the police force. But the effect of this policy will be the reverse of what lobbyists desire. Defunding or abolishing the police will make it harder for officers to police crime-ridden inner-city communities, mainly occupied by blacks Americans.

Real Criminal Justice Reforms Are Needed

Ending the war on marijuana is a worthwhile alternative to reduce hostile interactions between blacks Americans and the police as well as reducing the black incarceration rate. During 2015-2017, there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined. This proposal will not only result in fewer black Americans being imprisoned, but more resources will be devoted to solving and preventing serious crimes; thereby saving the lives of black Americans who are more likely to be victims of violent crimes.

It is good that the BLM movement is working to ensure that black Americans are protected from police brutality. Yet it should also work to eliminate other policies instituted by the American government that can indeed become obstacles to justice. One such policy usually criticized by Libertarians is prosecutorial immunity. As Clark Neily illustrates in his essay “A Libertarian Vision for Criminal Justice”:

Absolute prosecutorial immunity is precisely what it sounds like: a complete bar on suing prosecutors for anything they do within the scope of their job as a prosecutor. Incredibly, that includes deliberate acts of malfeasance, such as knowingly and even vindictively prosecuting an innocent person and even suborning perjury to help secure an unjust conviction.

For the BLM movement to become a serious organization, its adherents must propose sensible policies that can ameliorate the conditions of Black America.

Stable Families Benefit All of Society

Another variable that is often not mentioned in this debate is the role of families in improving outcomes for black Americans. Research has shown that young people raised in stable two-parent homes generate higher incomes than their contemporaries raised by single parents.

Sociologist David Popenoe has spent a career documenting the appalling effects of fatherlessness. Based on the findings of a landmark study, “racial income gaps are smaller when more fathers and married adults are present in a black boy’s community, irrespective of his own personal situation.”

Communities with stronger families are richer in social capital and opportunities; hence the benefits of residing in such neighborhoods, also positively affect children, whose own parents may not be living together. Fixing black families, therefore, will produce a beneficial effect for black Americans overall.

It is incredibly important that leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement take an inward look by examining how blacks Americans can create stronger families. The improved outcomes that will result will, by extension, reduce the negative externalities caused by unstable families which can manifest in criminal activity.

The BLM movement must dismiss hysterical recommendations. It must advocate serious reforms of the criminal justice system that ensure that the application of justice is fair and equitable. Furthermore, activists cannot expect most people to endorse the BLM movement when supporters seem to ignore the facts that black Americans so frequently take the lives of other blacks.

Black Lives Matter will not be a legitimate movement until activists begin to care about all lives — not just those killed by the police. Unless and until the BLM movement accepts the facts of reality, it will always remain a rogue group.

Celebs Call To Abolish The Police While Hiding Behind Private Security,"The Black Lives Matter movement seeks to counter the systemic racism they believe is foundational in American culture with a systemic solution: defunding the police. The calls to defund the police have reached the ears of every elected official, from local levels up to the federal executive. Now, the cries from the street are being echoed by celebrities.

A group of some of the most notable black artists in America have penned a letter to studios and Hollywood executives demanding the entertainment industry divest from police. But the experience of the wealthy in the absence of police will be far different than that of the average BLM protester.

While many on the left have said that defunding the police does not mean disbanding them entirely, many others have said that abolishing the police force is exactly what they have in mind. A public letter from black artists and thinkers states they are inspired by the protesters, and want to amplify their demands:

[The protesters’s] courage and imagination have inspired us to build on their necessary demands — including, chiefly, the abolition of police, and the complete dismantling of the racist prison-industrial system. Through this statement, we hope to amplify the movement’s work and to call out our own industries for what they are: institutions that promote colonialism, capitalism, and racism, and that function in exploitative and destructive ways.

In echoing the protester’s demands, these celebs claim themselves and their industry as part of the “systemic” alleged problems. Instead of using the clout and platform that accompanies celebrity status to offer leadership or guidance to those marching in the streets, they first offer to dismantle their own workplaces. The letter calls on cultural institutions to act:

…publicly condemn the use of police as a violent force that exists to further class divisions and capitalistic exploitation which harm our communities. Museums, arts foundations, theaters, studios, events venues, festivals, universities, libraries, book stores, publishing houses, schools, and social media companies must break contracts with police departments and reconceive what it means to keep art, audiences, and patrons safe. This is a first and clear step that cultural institutions must take toward the broader call to defund the police nationwide.

This level of self-obsession is so typical of members of the celebrity class. But what would this mean in terms of actionable, real consequences? If there were no police, or a force that had been cut in half or more, what would this look like?

Speaking to The Daily, John Eligan relays his conversation with a Black Lives Matter activist who details her take on what the abolishing of police would be like in practice. “It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need,” she tells Eligan, “We can’t decide that.”

Theoretically, money would be diverted from police departments to community-based programs, where people would decide for their communities what they need. At a studio level or the level of cultural institutions across the board, those organizations and businesses would decide what they need for security.

Many options are not police-based. Facial recognition software could be used to require all visitors, artists, and executives to be vetted via criminal background checks to ensure criminals aren’t coming on set. If everyone could be fingerprinted, these fingerprints could be used to gain entry to these unpoliced spaces. Of course, studios could also hire private security companies for protection.

But while it’s one thing to attempt such reforms at the institutional level where people can consent to give up their privacy or employ cops-for-hire so these spaces stay safe, what about in entire metropolises?

Celebs Can Go Without Police — Regular Americans Can’t

Instead of police responding to homelessness, “homelessness outreach personnel” would respond. Instead of police responding to late-night domestic disputes, social workers would pull up in their Subarus ready to make a new case file. Instead of police responding to violent crime, members of the community would respond in whatever way their neighborhood group saw fit. Instead of police investigating homicides or organized crime, something else would happen — or not. According to the “Defund The Police” activists, police don’t do a great job anyway, so they wouldn’t be missed.

In his interview with the BLM activist, Elgin brought up that, while they were different and distinct cases, self-deputized members of the community took matters into their own hands to end the lives of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery. Her response was, “I know, I get that, and I’ll be really real with you. I don’t have all the answers for that either, I don’t, and I wish I did.”

The celebs who penned this letter don’t have concrete answers either. What they demand and present are platitudes: “to break ties with the police…put their money where their mouths are…advocate for black people…get educated…[and] imagine black freedom.”

If cultural institutions stopped working with the police, they would hire private security companies to do the work instead. Private security companies are not beholden to anything or anyone other than their clients. Celebs who already have bodyguards or security details would be able to retain those services as well. While celebs would be safe and snug behind their walls of wealth, communities across the country would be left vulnerable to dangerous criminals.

When the wealthy call for defunding police, they are speaking from a place of privilege in society that means they can have little to no regard for those who are most affected by the decline in the enforcement of criminal laws.

Calls to ‘Abolish the Police’ Are Wildly Utopian

The narrative against police that tells us crime is a direct result of social inequity, and that should social inequity be destroyed crime would not exist, is driving this conversation that our nation does not need police. But it is a lie.

There is this idea that if there were no police, if that money were redirected at vulnerable communities, there would be no crime in these areas. The claim is that in the absence of systemic problems, there would be no reason for people to commit crimes. Despair and economic injustice leads to crime, goes the claim. A group called MPD150, which advocates for abolishing police in Minneapolis, states:

Crime isn’t random. Most of the time, it happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs through other means. So to really ‘fight crime,’ we don’t need more cops’ we need more jobs, more education, opportunities, more arts programs, more community centers, more mental health resources, and more of a say in how communities function.

This concept is not rational or reasoned. It is the eternal attempt of human beings striving for a utopia, a paradise on earth, a perfect commune where everyone has what he needs and wants for no more. It isn’t reality. Material gain does not eliminate the human drive for more; often, it accelerates it.

The black artists and celebrities of “Black Artists for Freedom” have not chosen to display leadership. Instead, they are seeking a way to remain safe within the industry that butters their bread. A group of people requesting the abolition of something they don’t even need is disingenuous at best, and callous at worst.

Every time police lessen their presence in the vulnerable communities of New York, Minneapolis, Seattle, or elsewhere, more death always comes for the downtrodden. In turn, the result is more violence and less accountability for both criminals and police.

In giving their voices to the mob, these artists have done little for liberation. Instead, all they’ve done is provided cover to those who would violate the very communities they claim a desire to protect.

"Wisconsin Mobs Beat Up Gay Lawmaker, Set Fire To Home, Invade Offices","MADISON — Wisconsin’s two largest cities were awash in violence Tuesday and into early Wednesday morning as “peaceful” Black Lives Matter protesters in Madison toppled iconic, progressive statues and beat up an openly gay state senator, while a Milwaukee mob set fire to a home and injured several police and a firefighter.

Wisconsin is out of control, and it is reaping the lawless fruit that pandering liberals have sown.

Long after the carnage quieted and state Sen. Tim Carpenter (D-Milwaukee) was recovering from his many injuries by the mob that badly beat him, the feckless Gov. Tony Evers “warned” he would send in the National Guard to protect state buildings. Too late.

By the time Tony decided he might get tough, protesters had torn down and destroyed the two legendary statues that have long guarded the State Capitol. They ripped down and soiled the famous, seven-foot Forward statue, a proud symbol of progress created by a Wisconsin female artist nearly 130 years ago.

Then they proceeded to drag down and decapitate a statue of Hans Christian Heg, a Union colonel who fought and died in the Civil War in large part because he abhorred slavery. They dumped what was left of the statue in Lake Monona. All in the name of “social justice”?

The trouble began when police dared to arrest a Black Lives Matter “activist” who decided to charge into a downtown Madison restaurant with a baseball bat and a bullhorn screaming at white patrons and accusing them of being racist.

“Devonere Johnson, 28, was arrested after causing a disturbance in a restaurant on the Capitol Square, according to Madison police and video of the incident. Videos of the arrest — some circulating on social media and others provided by the Madison Police Department — show as many as five officers taking Johnson to the sidewalk and carrying him to a police squad car after Johnson initially resisted arrest,” the Wisconsin State Journal reported.

Johnson, a black man who identifies as Yeshua Musa, has been a constant presence at the disorderly and, at times, violent protests against police brutality, racism, capitalism, and whatever else the radical left anarchists feel like protesting.

Soon after Johnson’s arrest, protesters assembled outside the Dane County Jail demanding the suspect be released. The State Journal reported some 300 protesters blocked traffic, yelled at drivers, and demanded they join the demonstration. Apparently one man was injured when a few drivers attempted to pass through the crowd. They apparently could not be drafted into the protest — and the bedlam that was to come.

Protesters quickly disabused the media and liberal Madison of the quaint notion that the radical movement was “peaceful.”

“This is not a peaceful protest, so if you came out here for a peaceful protest, you missed it,” one organizer said, according the State Journal “We’re done being peaceful. Now we demanding justice.”

Apparently “justice” means tearing down iconic progressive statues, setting city buildings on fire and beating the hell out of a gay liberal senator. Carpenter was attacked by several protesters because he attempted to film the destruction. He posted an 11-second clip on Twitter early this morning.

“I took this pic (and) it got me assaulted and beat up,” said the senator, who has been a leading proponent of the Black Lives Matter movement. He said eight to 10 people punched and kicked him in the head, neck, and ribs.

The newspaper reported that protesters set a small fire on one of the windows of the City-County Building Downtown, which also houses the Madison Police Department’s Downtown station. A group shattered the front entrance windows of the Tommy G. Thompson Center on Public Leadership, which houses several state offices, and others knocked down street cameras or spray painted over the lenses, the State Journal reported.

The demonstrators washed down their night of violence with a Molotov cocktail thrown into the city engineering office, a city council member told the State Journal. They attempted to break into the Capitol, according to multiple reports, before law enforcement officials showed up in riot gear and warned the group to leave or face arrest. Some still chanted “Free Yeshua” between screaming obscenities at police.

In Milwaukee, a mob burned down the house of man they suspected of sex trafficking. Liberal leaders, including state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff (D-Milwaukee) attempted to defuse the situation, according to Urban Milwaukee. The crowd wanted blood. Community members believed two missing teenage girls were inside.

They threw bricks at police as they intervened, injuring at least seven law enforcement officials, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.

“Three victims were shot during this event, none by police,,” Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said at a press conference. “We cannot allow an unruly crowd to determine what that investigation is,” he said. “What you had today was vigilantism.”

But the liberal mayors and city councils in Madison and Milwaukee have often excused the unruly crowds, pandering to radical activists who have made clear they will use whatever means necessary to make their point — whatever that may be. Evers has done the same.

Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) criticized the Democrat this morning for failing to protect the public and public property.

“Enough is enough. Governor Evers has all of the tools at his disposal to stop this. He commands the State Patrol. He commands the Capitol Police. He commands the National Guard. The governor must step up and immediately put an end to this violence. He cannot allow this to continue,” Fitzgerald said.

7 Ways White Women Used Their Privilege To Fuel Riots And Mayhem,"Social media is awash with curious images of woke white women creating mayhem at Black Lives Matter demonstrations. They’ve burned down a Wendy’s, set fire to cop cars, screamed obscenities in the faces of police officers, and assaulted a Wisconsin lawmaker.

It’s strange to observe white women in pricey athleisure scream at black cops and dress like they’re in “The Purge” to set fast food restaurants ablaze. It raises a question as to why members of the fairer sex are on the frontlines of riotous efforts to support a movement that insists they’re racist, capitalism is racist, and the whole system is racist. Here’s a round-up of some of the most noteworthy examples from recent weeks.

1. Assaulted Wisconsin Democrat State Sen. Tim Carpenter

Wisconsin State Sen. Tim Carpenter, who is a Democrat and openly gay, was assaulted in Madison Tuesday night by what appears to be two white women protestors charging toward him. It was reported that Carpenter collapsed walking to the statehouse building and paramedics were called.

“I don’t know what happened … all I did was stop and take a picture … and the next thing I’m getting five-six punches, getting kicked in the head,” Carpenter told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

I took this pic- it got me assaulted & beat up. Punched/kicked in the head, neck, ribs. Maybe concussion, socked in left eye is little blurry, sore neck & ribs. 8-10 people attacked me. Innocent people are going to get killed. Capitol locked- stuck in office.Stop violence nowPlz! pic.twitter.com/Zw2hdfYG66 — Tim Carpenter (@TimCarpenterMKE) June 24, 2020

3. Supplied Instructions for the Destruction of Statues

Thompson describes herself as “America’s only full-time professor of art crime,” who studies “damage done to humanity’s shared heritage through looting, theft, and the deliberate destruction of art.” Naturally, as protestors have continued tearing down statues across the country regardless of the statue’s significance or history, Thompson gave her two cents on the best methods for the senseless destruction.

“Use chain instead of rope and it’ll go faster,” Thompson tweeted.

Sarah Parcak, an archaeologist and Egyptologist, also weighed in on best practices for tearing down obelisks or monuments. Even going as far as suggesting her followers look for a monument in Birmingham, Alabama to destroy.

4. Justified ‘The Destruction of Property’

R.H. Lossin, a white women, wrote an article for The Nation titled, “In Defense of Destroying Property” in which she explores the question: What if property destruction “is not a frustrated, emotional reaction but a reasonable and articulate expression in itself?”

Lossin argues, “property destruction is not synonymous with the violence that is being protested” and that we must not conflate people and objects. She addresses the “more complicated matter” of the destruction of small businesses, which are often minority-owned, by writing them off as “instrumentalized in the service” of capitalism.

Additionally, we shouldn’t let the image of “mom and pop” shops conflate property and people, she notes.

Journalist Kara Voght writes in a Mother Jones report on the suburban white women voting bloc that “The Trump era has seen the emergence of the ‘resistance’ woman, a small, progressive-leaning subset of educated white women radicalized by Trump’s win.” Just last year, “the share of college-educated women in the U.S. workforce passed the share of college-educated men,” The Washington Post reported.

CHOP Leaders Insist Protest Was Successful As They Disband In Failure,"“CHOP,” Seattle’s lawless Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, is no longer occupied.

The “Solidarity Committee” of CHOP, the six-block cop-free area previously named CHAZ for Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, addressed their “Comrades in the struggle” on Twitter Wednesday to break the news: “The CHOP project is now concluded.”

https://twitter.com/CHOPOfficialSEA/status/1275852376423960581

“Over the last two weeks, we achieved what no one thought possible. We successfully built a self-governing community and convinced city leaders to enact meaningful police reform, including substantial budget cuts to the SPD,” the committee said of their “beloved CHOP,” where very few demonstrators remain. The committee noted that their morning “census” revealed fewer than two dozen CHOP occupants near the police precinct and only 11 near Seattle’s Space Needle.

“Thank you to everyone for your support over the last two weeks and congratulations on your victories. You should feel proud!” the statement continued, accompanied by the hashtag #ChopWasASuccess on the announcement tweet.

While the committee championed CHOP’s victory in convincing Seattle authorities to cut the police budget, their achievement was far from monumental. Mayor Jenny Durkan has proposed a $20 million, or 5 percent, cut to the Seattle Police Department’s budget as part of a plan to remedy the city’s $378 million budget gap resulting from increased Wuhan virus response spending and plummeting revenue. This is a far cry from CHOP occupants’ demands for a 50 percent, or over $200 million, budget cut — and not even close to “defunding the police.”

So it remains unclear as to which “success” the committee is referring.

In discussing CHOP’s success, one must not overlook its demonstrable safety and harmony.

CHOP leaders must not have heard about the alleged sexual assault that occurred in the encampment, when a man lured a deaf woman into his tent, tried to kiss her, and covered her mouth and told her not to scream while he climbed on top of her and tried to take off her clothes. After a medic intervened, he even tried to drag the victim back into his tent.

The Seattle police chief gave reporters quite a list of crimes that had occurred within CHOP, including shootings that left one person dead and more injured, arson, burglary, an assault, a rape, and destroyed property, according to NBC News.

So far, about a dozen residents and businesses have sued the city over the anarchic zone that violated their constitutional property rights, and one shooting victim is reportedly considering suing the police, which would boil down to another lawsuit against the city.

CHOP’s Solidarity Committee concluded its announcement by urging onlookers not to “let the momentum die” — and of course by endorsing Joe Biden for president and rallying behind Jay Inslee and Mayor Durkan.

The Media Ignored A Massive Mob Ambush Of Police In Tampa Bay,"Early Saturday morning, two Tampa Bay police officers were jumped by a mob in an attack that received virtually no mainstream coverage. The two officers received phony calls about a shooting at a nearby intersection and were dispatched to find the victims. When they arrived, they found hundreds of anti-police demonstrators.

The mob blocked off all four exits and surrounded the officers, shouting and throwing glass bottles. Both were struck on the heads as they searched for victims and were hospitalized when backup eventually got them away from the crowd.

The attack was indiscriminate as to which officers responded to the call and appears to have been highly organized. It played upon the officers attempting to assist injured citizens. It also demonstrates that rage at law enforcement has grown so extreme that its possible to swiftly organize not dozens, but hundreds of individuals willing to harass and injure police at random. Because of this, there is no good reason why major networks other than Fox were unwilling to cover it.

Silence may not be violence, but by refusing to report the assault, the media is indirectly protecting the attackers. They also make it more likely events like this will happen again soon. As fewer Americans on both sides of the aisle hear of the attack, there will be little pressure on organizers to condemn or disavow such tactics.

Psychologists have shown that radical elements can make horrifying decisions as long as others in the group are unwilling to call them out. If the culprits believe they have general, unspoken support, they will continue, if not escalate, their actions. It’s the same effect that fuels police brutality.

We’ve seen a string of unprovoked attacks on police nationwide since protests erupted. This includes ambushes in Oakland, Las Vegas, New York, Davenport, Ben Lomond, Paso Robles, and a separate ambush in Tampa. All of these attacks received virtually no coverage despite, as seen in Tampa Bay, their increasing size and organization. The media’s refusal to cover the attacks sets a disturbing precedent and could very well end in an even larger tragedy.

"No, The U.S. Shouldn’t Disarm Police Like In The U.K.","Oh, to be in England, where the bobbies patrol without guns, and peace and harmony rule. That’s the idea peddled by The Nation’s D.D. Guttenplan, who calls for not only defunding but also disarming the police.

In one sense, you can’t deny the logic of his argument. If you reduce the number of police through defunding and then take away their guns, there are sure to be fewer police-involved shootings. But defunding and disarming police would also give you more of some things, not the least of them being more violent crime.

Calls to disarm the police ignore this, just as they ignore the fact that police shootings have declined dramatically over the last 50 years. As Manhattan Institute scholar Rafael A. Mangual recently noted in the Wall Street Journal: “In 1971 the New York City Police Department reported 810 firearms discharges by officers, which wounded 220 people and killed 93. In 2016 those numbers were down to 72 shootings, 23 wounded and nine killed.”

Mangual also cited a 2018 study analyzing more than 100,000 arrests. More than 99 percent of those arrests were made without the use of physical force, and when force was used, 98 percent of the suspects sustained only mild or no injury.

It is safe to say that many of those arrested would have been far more tempted to use physical force to resist arrest, had the arresting officers not been armed. The mere presence of police firearms can be a powerful deterrent to violence.

Calls to adopt “the British model” ignore another salient fact: We don’t live in Great Britain. The U.K. does not recognize a right to keep and bear arms—a right that existed in our country even before it was enshrined in the Second Amendment in 1789—and has spent the last century systematically disarming its civilian population. Today, fewer than 4 percent of the British population own any sort of firearm.

America is far different. More than 40 percent of our citizens live in a household with guns. Indeed, there are more firearms in America than there are Americans. Millions of them are on the streets illegally, and not all of them are in the hands of good guys.

With remarkably few exceptions, the police are the good guys. And it’s a good thing they are armed. The ability of armed law enforcement to respond quickly to violent threats has saved countless lives.

Consider last year’s shooting in a crowded section of downtown Dayton, Ohio, when local police neutralized the shooter less than 30 seconds after he fired the first shot. Or the earlier mass murder in Gilroy, California, in which armed police brought down the shooter in about a minute. Those two incidents alone claimed 12 innocent lives. How many more would have been lost had the police been armed with only billy clubs, Tasers, and whistles?

To ask police to do their jobs in extremely dangerous environments without adequate means of protection defies logic. Even in idyllic England, they recognize the need to increase police firepower consistent with increased risk. Thus, in the aftermath of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, London equipped more of its officers with guns. As violent crime has risen, the city continues to boost the number and response capabilities of its armed police.

It’s a false idea that disarming the police would usher in an era of non-violent conflict resolution in which nobody gets hurt and everyone gets along. That’s not the real world. In the real world, there are criminals committing serious crimes. They are an active and powerful force, and police departments were created specifically to counter that force. Defunding and disarming the police would only cede ground to mayhem and chaos.

What would be the real-world consequence of doing that? Christopher F. Rufo describes it this way: “In the subsequent vacuum of physical power, wealthy neighborhoods would deploy private police forces, and poor neighborhoods would organize around criminal gangs — deepening structural inequalities and harming the very people that the police abolitionists say they want to help.”

In short, the body count would rise, and majority-minority communities, where most violent crime occurs, would suffer the most. Moreover, if fewer police officers carried firearms, the number of citizens purchasing guns to protect themselves and their loved ones would undoubtedly increase dramatically.

Yes, there are ways we can reduce the number of police-involved shootings. De-escalation training, for example, has routinely proved effective in this regard, as has increased training using realistic shoot-or-don’t-shoot simulators. We should do more of these. We also favor greater transparency and accountability to weed out bad cops, and providing incentives to help recruit high-quality candidates willing to serve and protect.

But at the end of the day, we live in a sinful world, one in which an effective and adequately armed police force is necessary to keep the forces of death and destruction at bay. We’ve seen what happens when local officials effectively suspend the rule of law by neutering their police forces. Riots. Arson. Looting. Murder.

Although violent crime rates have dropped over the last two decades, we still believe, regrettably, that we have not entered the Age of Aquarius and that Thomas Hobbes’s vision that in the state of nature, people would live in “continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” is closer to the mark.

Society disintegrates quickly without the rule of law. And a heavily armed nation needs well-armed, well-funded, and well-trained police officers to assure the safety of its citizens and to serve justice.

Why Banning Chokeholds Endangers The Lives of Aggressors And Police,"I’m not particularly squeamish, but I could not bring myself to watch the entire video of George Floyd’s death. I could not endure the brutal and callous way he faced his final moments.

Now, as a martial arts practitioner, I have seen plenty of people knocked out or choked out. In fact, it’s happened to me. What happened to Floyd was different. Law enforcement officers and martial arts teachers I have spoken with all agree.

Former police officer Derek Chauvin applied overbearing force to the side of Floyd’s neck. It was by no reasonable definition a “chokehold.” The pressure held for almost nine minutes was unnecessary and inexcusable. It was not a split-second decision that the officer had to make. Kneeling on someone’s neck and constricting arteries and the carotid sinus while maintaining that pressure on an unconscious man is not a chokehold. It was a form of abuse and should be prosecuted.

For understandable reasons, then, the response of many to Floyd’s death, along with the resulting protests, is, “We need to do something!” Yet that reaction is also a dangerous one. The proper course of action concerning the complex problems of race and policing in the United States is far from obvious. Doing “something” for the mere sake of being able to say that “something” was done often makes things worse.

There have been multiple calls to ban or limit chokeholds. This is not a helpful way of addressing the problems we face. It could even make already dangerous situations more perilous. Indeed, any time people with no knowledge of subject change regulations and legislation, mistakes are bound to follow. Changes to law and policy should come as a result of informed and reasoned debate.

Having studied martial arts for several decades, I forgot how scary words like “choke” and “strangle” sound. To many, those words elicit images of vicious attacks designed to kill. In reality, they are simply one of the options available to martial artists, and I have helped many students learn how to use them properly, including my children.

Chokes are simply tools, used both in sports like judo and violent situations. Like any tool, they can be used for good or harm. Like guns, however, they can evoke strong visceral reactions. In reality, chokeholds can be a safe, responsible, even peaceful tool to be used in a violent altercation.

To begin with, there are two fundamental types of chokes: air-chokes and blood-chokes (sometimes called “strangles”). They are applied differently and induce different physiological effects.

Air-chokes occlude the trachea and stop a person from inhaling. The effect of an air choke is usually immediate, not because of the loss of air, but due to the pain and damage caused to the trachea. People instinctively react to pressure to the front of their throats by backing up as quickly as possible.

If they cannot, because the back of their head may be against the ground or restrained, additional pain and even damage can occur to the trachea. If applied with extreme force, this can eventually lead to asphyxiation.

The big problem with air-chokes is not the lack of air while the choke is applied, but the damage that may happen to the trachea. If the damage is severe enough, even when the choke is released, the injury may prevent the person from breathing properly, resulting in asphyxiation later. Thus, air-chokes hold a real danger, especially if applied carelessly and improperly.

Blood-chokes, on the other hand, stop the flow of blood to the brain by restricting the carotid arteries on either side of the neck. When the brain stops receiving blood, the drop in glucose makes a person “pass out,” or what physicians call syncope.

This is actually painless, like falling asleep. When the choke is released, blood returns to the brain and the person regains consciousness. Damage to the brain from a loss of blood results only if the choke is held for minutes after syncope. Thus, a blood-choke, despite its scary name, is a fairly safe technique.

Just how dangerous are these chokeholds? Given that hundreds of thousands of people practice them daily at innumerable judo and jujitsu schools, they are clearly not as dangerous as they may sound. Blood-chokes are especially safe. Unless one is applied to an unconscious individual for three minutes or more, which does not happen by accident, they are generally harmless.

An overzealous application of an air-choke, however, can certainly injure a person; an extremely vicious use could kill. Yet the firm use of this type of choke is used responsibly every day in martial arts schools throughout the world.

This brings us to the question of the police using chokeholds. Law enforcement officers follow something called the “force continuum” when trying to direct others’ behavior. It begins simply with their presence, moves up to verbal commands, different degrees of unarmed force, non-lethal tools like Tasers, and finally lethal force with firearms.

A blood-choke is a much better way to stop a person from fighting than striking a person repeatedly with a baton. There is no injury or shedding of blood.

Even an air-choke has an appropriate place on the scale. Imagine a criminal has tackled a police officer to the ground and is on top of him trying to grab his pistol. Another officer arrives from behind. What should he do? In this scenario, I believe a strong air-choke to pull him off that first officer is in the best interest of everyone. There may be some pain and even possible injury to the aggressor, but far less than many of the other tactics that could be used.

If defending officers are banned from using chokeholds, they are left with three choices: use less aggressive but less effective techniques; escalate on the continuum of force to more violence; or use an effective chokehold and face prosecution. None of these are ideal in this situation.

With some jurisdictions forbidding or severely restricting the use of chokeholds, we are moving in a dangerous direction. Doing so denies a useful law enforcement tool that could be effective in many situations that require some force to address the situation at hand.

Proper training of police officers in the use and dangers of chokeholds would be “doing something” useful and I strongly support this. The responsible use of chokeholds serves the best interest of all involved. Counter-intuitive as it may sound, they are sometimes the virtuous choice.

Belittled Women: The Rise Of White Guilt Chick Lit,"Saira Rao and Regina Jackson Turner are self-described women of color who make a good living catering to white women. Tickets for their Race 2 Dinner events, which their website describes as a chance for “white women” to participate in a “conversation about how the white women at the table are complicit in the continued injustices of our white supremacist society,” sell for $2,500 a pop.

While Rao and Turner have clearly found a niche for their ideas among the wealthy elite who want to luxuriate in evenings of fine wine and self-flagellation, executives at Penguin Random House believe there is much wider appetite for books that point the finger at readers. In April they signed the pair to write “White Women: Everything You Already Know About Your Own Racism and How to Get Better.”

Their book joins a relatively new but growing genre of works – both fiction and nonfiction, by authors of all races – that aim to educate whites about the deep racism that supports their privileged lives. These woke beach reads infuse the best-selling template of white-bread chick lit with the consciousness of social justice warriors.

This spring brought “A Good Neighborhood” by New York Times best-selling author Therese Anne Fowler. It centers on Xavier, a polite, smart, classical guitar-playing black teenager in North Carolina, who starts dating a rich white neighbor and is falsely accused of raping her by her racist, sexist, pervert, tree-killing (yes, really) stepfather.

The boy’s lawyer tells him: “You are a black man accused of raping an underage white girl. If you put yourself in front of a jury, you’ve got twelve strangers who’ll be literally sitting in judgment of you. … Some of those jurors will be women. Some of them will be white. White fathers of teenage girls if the prosecution can manage it.”

At various points, Fowler, who is white, pauses to have characters lecture readers about the racist criminal justice system and the “talk” that many black parents have with their children about how the police won’t give them the benefit of the doubt. The novel adds class concerns to the racial mix. At Xavier’s bail hearing, his mother asks, “So if I happen to have a quarter mill laying around I lose nothing. But if I’m one of the ninety-nine percent who don’t, I forfeit twenty-five grand. That’s a fair system?”

Extended lectures about structural racism have become a regular feature of books that would be placed on a list of “beach reads.” In “Privilege,” the recently published campus novel by Mary Adkins, who is white, a biracial character named Bea recalls staying with the family of a white friend when a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer who killed Michael Brown.

“The conversation had left Bea frustrated – mostly with herself for not speaking up. … Was it really that hard for [her friend’s father] to understand that you’re treated differently based on race? Or did he just not want to know it? Was it that hard to know … that racial bias could be subconscious?”

The eponymous protagonist of the novel “Queenie,” a Jamaican British 20-something, makes it her mission to publish articles about police shootings in America and attend Black Lives Matter protests in London. “Another black man died in America today,” Queenie tells Darcy, a self-described “liberal” friend and co-worker. “Police killed him.”

“Oh no, what was he doing?” she asked absentmindedly. “What do you mean, ‘What was he doing?’ He wasn’t doing anything, he was driving.” The words burst forth from me. “And even if he was doing something, doesn’t mean he should be killed for it. … You asked a stupid question. … That sort of attitude is the problem. … I’m not calling you a racist, I’m saying that if the thinking is that someone should be killed for doing something wrong, that thinking is dangerous.”

None of these novels mentions the disproportionate rates of crime committed by blacks, which might account for the more frequent than average encounters that black people have with the police; or the number of black people murdered by other black people, which dwarfs the number shot by police; or the number of black lives that have been saved by supposedly racist police tactics.

The point of these books is that even well-meaning white people don’t really grasp how bad the system is and how, through their “unconscious bias,” they are at least in part to blame.

These works reflect the larger “Great Awokening” that has taken hold since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. This phrase is shorthand for the powerful mixture of virtue and guilt that informs many well-educated liberal white Americans.

Zach Goldberg reported in Tablet that surveys show white liberals are now more pessimistic about race relations than African Americans. They are the only demographic group in America to display a “pro-outgroup” bias – meaning that among all the different groups surveyed, white liberals were the only ones who expressed a preference for other racial and ethnic communities above their own.

So do the white women reading these novels enjoy being accused of racism? Joseph Bottum, who edited the Weekly Standard’s book reviews for many years and is the author most recently of “The Decline of the Novel,” says he’s “not sure they are enjoying it.” But it is serving a purpose. He compares these didactic novels to Lutheran hymns, which other Protestants used to joke were “catechism reduced to song.” It’s just a slightly easier way to digest a highhanded lecture.

It’s easy to see why these messages have so easily lent themselves to Young Adult fiction too. Angie Thomas’ “The Hate U Give,” which spent almost an entire year on the New York Times bestseller list, follows Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black girl growing up in a working-class family in the inner city while attending a private mostly white school in the suburbs.

Her friend Khalil is shot in the back by a police officer and Starr is the sole witness. The book follows the Black Lives Matter narrative — that innocent, unarmed black teenage boys are regularly murdered by racist officers and no one is held accountable when they do.

Kyla Schuller, a white professor of women’s gender and sexuality studies at Rutgers University, applauds this trend. She especially credits the work of “black feminist writing online for the last 10 years or so” at websites such as Jezebel and Feminista, whose writers “have made it clear that a discussion of women’s experience that doesn’t interrogate race becomes a part of white supremacy.”

Schuller, who is writing a book called “The Trouble With White Women” about the history of intersectional feminism (which acknowledges “how different forms of discrimination intersect with and amplify gender-based discrimination”), says the “market data suggest that the average woman reader really likes these themes. They’re coming back for more. It suggests that maybe if they’re provoked, it’s in a way that feels useful.” Schuller believes the books that publishers “want from women authors are not about motherhood. Motherhood is over. They want books at intersection of race, gender and sexuality.”

Bottum also believes that these novelists and their readers “have a hunger for a moral purpose” and combating racism “is the only moral purpose our society has on offer.” He compares such novels to the 1930s and ’40s literature of social realism. Authors like John Dos Passos or Upton Sinclair “had to throw in undigested bits of Marxism” in the midst of their stories.

The lectures in these modern novels go well beyond complaints about prejudiced police officers or structural racism to expose the unconscious bias of seemingly well-meaning whites.

In “Such a Fun Age,” Kiley Reid’s widely praised 2019 novel, the protagonist Emira is essentially asked to decide who is more racist – her boyfriend, Kelley, or her employer, Alex (the two used to date in high school). Kelley tells her: “You’re not the first black woman Alex has hired to work for her family, and you probably won’t be the last.”

The fact that Alex wants to befriend Emira, by “accidentally ordering two salads and offering one to Emira, or sending her home with a bag filled with frozen dinners and soups,” seems to be of great importance. “It wasn’t that Emira didn’t understand the racially charged history,” she thinks to herself.

As if having her meals bought weren’t racist enough, it turns out that her boyfriend may be “one of those white guys who not only goes out of his way to date black women but only wants to date black women.” As one of the other characters notes, “People like that think that it says something good about them, that they’re so brave and unique that they would even dare to date black women. Like they’re some kind of martyr.”

This outing of unconscious bias also takes place in reviews of these novels. In her New York Times review of “A Good Neighborhood,” Reid, who is black, criticizes Fowler, who is white, for presenting a cartoon version of prejudice.

She compares Fowler’s unjustly accused protagonist, Xavier, to Uncle Tom – “a nonthreatening fantasy for the book’s white audience” – and writes that “racism is depicted much like death or pregnancy, in that it is an all-or-nothing, binary state of being. The racist characters are brazenly racist: They call biracial children ‘abominations’ and freely use the n-word. The nonracist characters are professional allies; one is actually martyred, in a ludicrous series of events, after storming away from a racist relative.”

Examinations of unconscious bias are also on full display during Race 2 Dinners. As an article in The Guardian described one of the events:

Morgan Richards admits she recently did nothing when someone patronizingly commended her for adopting her two black children, as though she had saved them. ‘What I went through to be a mother, I didn’t care if they were black,’ she says, opening a window for Rao to challenge her: ‘So, you admit it is stooping low to adopt a black child?’ And Richards accepts that the undertone of her statement is racist. As more confessions like this are revealed, Rao and Jackson seem to press those they think can take it, while empathizing with those who can’t. “Well done for recognizing that,” Jackson says, to soothe one woman. “We are all part of the problem. We have to get comfortable with that to become part of the solution.”

Just as part of the problem is white women being too nice to black women who work for them and white men dating black women, so it is also white families adopting black children. And the solution? Well, it seems to be greater racial separation and more acceptance of guilt by white people.

John Wilson, who used to edit the literary magazine Books & Culture, says these novels recall conversations from his college years during the 1960s. “White people would say they’re not racist, but it didn’t matter because others would say that they participated in racist structures. … It made it impossible to carry on a conversation.”

Women are definitely talking about the books. Anna Ford, founder and CEO of Bookclubz (an online organizational tool for 12,000 clubs worldwide), said that racially charged books – including “Such a Fun Age,” “The Hate U Give,” “Nickel Boys” by Colson Whitehead and “The Water Dancer” by Ta-Nehisi Coates – have been among the most popular.

“What we know about all book clubs is that they have this inherent culture of respect,” Ford said. “People come because they want to share their ideas and opinions and want to hear others.” She said these conversations about race may be able to happen more easily because there is a “recognition of other people’s vulnerability.” Book clubs, she notes, “are a safe space.”

But John McWhorter, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and a frequent commentator on race, said these books seem less intent on sparking discussion than sending a message. “We are constantly told that America remains in some kind of denial about racism, that the lesson never gets through. But this is said so very much, in so many places, and has been for so very long that you start to wonder at what point we might admit that the message has gotten out there.”

McWhorter suggests that “when the woke perspective on race is casually preached even in books like these, it’s one more piece of evidence that people who insist that America is deaf and dumb to the nature of racism are concerned less with public advocacy and social change than in displaying an aggrieved oppositional attitude as a kind of identity, as an end in itself, regardless of reality.”

Shelby Steele, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of “White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era,” suggests this current crop of novels are “what happens when someone writes out of an identity rather than out of their individual selves. They squeeze themselves into really bad ideas — that white males commonly fetishize black women, etc.

“They seem to be satisfying the terms of a Black Lives Matter black identity rather than exploring their experience as individuals. And, as always, their characterizations and story lines arrive at black victimization as eternal truth. They fail to be interesting as writers because actual truth is forbidden.”

"Seattle Police Chief Blasts CHOP: Two Men Are Dead, ‘Enough Is Enough’","Following a series of shootings in Seattle’s self-proclaimed cop-free zone, or CHOP (Capitol Hill Organized Protest), the police chief is taking a stand.

During a Monday press conference, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said it was time for CHOP to close down. “Enough is enough,” she declared. “Two African American men are dead at a place where they claim to be working for Black Lives Matter.”

A 16-year-old was killed in CHOP Monday. A 19-year-old was also killed June 20. Another 14-year-old is in critical condition from one of the CHOP shootings.

As Best spoke, hecklers chanted and blared horns to drown out her responses to questions from the press. Best said over the noise, “That is so rude. This is what I’m talking about. This kind of behavior is irrational and unacceptable.”

CHOP, formally known as CHAZ, or Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, was founded three weeks ago after a series of violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement, ignited by the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent rioting and protests over police brutality. The clashes came to head when police abandoned one Seattle precinct, and CHOP took over the area.

The mainstream media continue to report that CHOP is “peaceful” or ignore it altogether. Even Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has referred to CHOP as a harmless “block party” and predicted the coming months in CHOP would be “the summer of love.”

Best disagreed, saying in her press conference, “We have had multiple other instances of assaults, rape, robbery, shootings, and this is something that is going to need to change.”

“We are asking people to remove themselves from this area for the safety of the people,” Best said, but she didn’t provide any details about what law enforcement is planning to do to dismantle CHOP or enforce its evacuation. “I can’t telegraph what’s going to happen,” she said. “I can tell you that I think enough is enough, I absolutely do.”

Durkan had said Friday that the concrete barricades surrounding CHOP would be removed on Sunday, and those directly outside the police’s east precinct would be left. No crews arrived on Sunday to remove them, however, and as of 3 p.m. Monday, the barricades were still up.

The Seattle department of transportation tried to remove the barriers early Friday morning, but were stopped by several people sitting or lying on the ground in front of the equipment.

Best took aim at the hypocrisy of CHOP, which was purportedly established as a reaction to the killing of Floyd and other unarmed black Americans at the hands of law enforcement. “Well I can tell you this,” Best said. “As an African American woman with uncles and brothers and stuff, I wouldn’t want them to be in this area. We’ve had two men killed and we have a child who’s injured from gunfire.”

Back The Blue Rallies Signal The Silent Majority Is Finding Its Voice,"The mainstream media would have you believe the entire country hates police officers. With all the focus devoted to Black Lives Matter protests and riots, so-called journalists continue to offer wall-to-wall coverage of the narratives and talking points of the Marxist group, which continues to falsely label all of law enforcement as “systemically racist.” Yet as they breathlessly broadcast on the subject, the media chooses to ignore the voices of those who refuse to bow to the mob to stand with their brothers and sisters in blue.

This past weekend, American and blue-lined flags waved in the Virginia skies, as thousands of citizens across the commonwealth turned out to show their appreciation for the men and women of law enforcement. Participants marched through the streets of Fredericksburg, Manassas, and Spotsylvania, with many dawning “Back the Blue” T-shirts and signs with slogans such as “No Police, No Peace” and “We Support Our Law Enforcement.”

With calls to “defund the police” growing among many left-wing activists, Back the Blue rallygoers decided to make their voices heard and show local police they’ve got their six. One rallygoer in Manassas explained the significance of pro-law enforcement marches, saying in an interview with Patch.com that “supporters of the police can no longer let their voices get drowned out by people protesting against the police.”

Spotsylvania local Katie Rasmussen, whose husband is a police officer, said she felt compelled to organize her local rally following the lack of support for law enforcement she had witnessed in recent weeks. “We owe it to our men and women in blue to show them they are not alone, not everyone has abandoned them, and we believe in ‘defend not defund,’” she said in a recent interview. “Our country needs law and order to function, and we support those who keep it.”

Similar sentiments were echoed by Amy Sudbeck, a Fredericksburg native who organized her city’s rally. “They need to know that they have our support,” she said. “I’m a mother, and I have children. We live in a civilized society, and we need to keep it that way.” Sudbeck also said she felt obligated to plan the event because police officers have been “going through a rough time” since protests began following the death of George Floyd.

It breaks my heart to see the grotesque treatment our law enforcement officials receive on a regular basis. Every day officers choose to put on the badge, they willingly put their lives on the line for all Americans, regardless of our race or background. Every morning they walk out the door, millions of families across the country are left to worry if their loved one will be home for dinner that night. Without question, they are the bravest among us.

None of this seems to cross the minds of those who continue to degrade and demean the men and women in blue. To them, police are nothing more than authority figures with no emotions, families, or fears. By dehumanizing law enforcement, they’re not only putting those on the front lines in grave danger, but they’re also breaking down trust between police and those who live in dangerous communities and need law enforcement to protect them. If police cannot do their jobs, more innocent civilians will die.

What the country must understand is that rallies like those in Virginia are vital and necessary to show our men and women in uniform how much love and appreciation millions of Americans have for the unimaginable work they do. No longer can the silent majority let our voices be drowned out by an angry, left-wing mob devoid of basic facts and rationality. We the people must be brave enough to stand with the men and women of law enforcement and to stare down tyranny when it looks us in the eye. The future of America and civil society depends on it.

3 Ways To Responsibly Fix What’s Wrong With Policing,"As a former policeman, I know America’s law enforcement officers have hard jobs. They make tough decisions in high-pressure situations, sometimes with life and death consequences. We need to ensure they’re well trained, trustworthy, and of sound character. We also need laws and rules of conduct that encourage the best outcomes, and we can’t ask them to do the impossible. Now is the right time to re-examine whether we’re accomplishing this.

When I left field and orchard work at the age of 19, I was fortunately entrusted with helping to guarantee public safety — first as a radio dispatcher and later a police officer in Toppenish, Washington. I still carry fond memories of the camaraderie inherent in the job, the sense of achievement in solving crimes, and the satisfaction in seeing justice achieved on behalf of victims. My father and mother proudly attended the ceremony the day I graduated from the police academy.

When I first completed the academy, I rode with a training officer, observing and learning. In the first few months of police work, some of the things I saw bothered me. Patrol units were encouraged to keep a close watch on taverns frequented by Latinos, and drivers departing at closing time were stopped regularly.

On its face, that sounds like a good idea as a way to prevent drunk driving. Unfortunately, we were discouraged from keeping watch at taverns frequented mostly by white customers. As a result, Latinos were cited for driving under the influence in much higher numbers than their white counterparts. I observed as fellow officers responding to an altercation were quick to book Latino offenders, while citing and releasing white offenders — or even allowing them to “walk it off” after confessing to assault.

I genuinely admired and respected the police chief, my boss and a good man who recognized the value of adding an officer who could improve outreach to the city’s growing Hispanic community. I told him it was in his power to change these inequities. I didn’t ask for tougher treatment of the public based on their skin color, nor did I ask for more lenient treatment. I requested that it be equitable.

He responded positively and made changes to the department policy manual regarding equal treatment under the law, changes that were well received by my colleagues. The situation improved when officers made a more determined effort to treat everyone impartially.

A two-tiered system of enforcement — wherein punishments disproportionately affect the less affluent — hurts communities, building resentment among the people the police are charged with protecting. The answer isn’t to eliminate law enforcement. That would guarantee lawlessness and predation of innocents. We need proper leadership to make effective change.

What does that change look like? Many ideas are being put forward, and we need policymakers to engage in an open debate that leads us to the best ones. But these three will move us in the right direction.

1. Transform police culture. Most police officers and law enforcement leaders across the country — people who risk their lives to serve and protect their communities — know that use-of-force policies must change. They are also rightly frustrated that many police union agreements protect bad actors from facing the consequences of their decisions.

2. Remove bad incentives such as civil asset forfeiture and qualified immunity, a judge-made law that prevents law enforcement officials who violate people’s constitutional rights from being held accountable for their actions. We must also reform the federal 1033 program that encourages police to treat communities like militarized combat zones rather than shared neighborhoods.

3. Eliminate unnecessary criminalization. As a society, we’ve aggressively criminalized behaviors we’d like to see less of, without considering the ramifications. We don’t even require adequate intent standards when charging and convicting people. Over the past 40 years, we’ve added 300,000 federal crimes to the enforcement burden that police officers carry, making the job far more difficult. We must enact robust federal and state overcriminalization reform.

The vast majority of the nation’s police take on this risky assignment because they are committed to keeping Americans safe, regardless of their skin color or other characteristics. They deserve laws that make sense, processes that help them succeed, and a system that allows them to focus on real threats to public safety.

Grieving Families Of Killed Children Call On ‘Black Lives Matter’ To Address Community Violence,"As the Fourth of July weekend saw at least five children shot and killed, many of their grieving families have pleaded with the Black Lives Matter movement to address violence within communities, not just deaths at the hands of police.

Eleven-year-old Davon McNeal was shot and killed in Washington, D.C. on the Fourth of July. His grandfather is calling for protesters to acknowledge violence that has nothing to do with police.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying black lives matter,” said John Ayala, who identified himself as McNeal’s paternal grandfather. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

John Ayala, tells @fox5dc he’s 11-year-old Davon McNeal’s paternal grandfather. Ayala says his grandson dreamed of being in the NFL & that everyone’s just tired of shootings in the community. He also mentions the Black Lives Matter protests in part of his interview. @fox5dc pic.twitter.com/ajrX7q5YkO — Stephanie Ramirez (@RamirezReports) July 5, 2020

According to his family, McNeal had stopped to pick up a phone charger before heading to a cookout when he was shot at by a group of five males. It’s not known whether the suspects have been identified.

Secoriea Turner, an 8-year-old girl from Atlanta, was also killed Saturday. She was shot across the street from the Wendy’s restaurant where a police officer shot Rayshard Brooks last month. Turner was in the car with her mother and a friend when they pulled into a parking lot and were met by a “group of armed individuals” at the entrance. Police reported that a crowd had set up barricades in the area after police had previously taken them down, and that someone from the group shot Turner’s car multiple times after the driver tried to get around the roadblocks.

Turner’s parents spoke out against the violent demonstrators after her death. “They say black lives matter,” said her father, Secoriya Williamson. “You killed your own this time.”

“We understand the frustration of Rayshard Brooks,” added Turner’s mother, Charmaine Turner. “We didn’t have anything to do with that. We’re innocent.”

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also criticized those anti-police protests which had turned deadly.

“These aren’t police officers shooting people on the streets of Atlanta, these are members of the community shooting each other,” Bottoms said. “We’re fighting the enemy within when we are shooting each other up on the streets.”

“You shot and killed a baby,” she continued. “If you want people to take us seriously, and you don’t want us to lose this movement, then we can’t lose each other.”

Bottoms has also been suggested as a potential vice presidential candidate for Joe Biden.

Natalia Wallace, age seven, was shot and killed while playing with other children in the yard in Chicago over the holiday weekend. Three suspects got out of a car and opened fire at the group, striking Wallace in the head.

Her father, Nathan Wallace, told local news media that he wants more police, not less, in Chicago. “Kids outside playing, they shouldn’t have to worry about guns and people shooting,” he added.

Natalie Wallace, Natalia’s aunt, also pointed out the disconnect between the Black Lives Matter movement and the realities of community violence. “We talk about Black Lives Matter,” she said, “but at the end of the day, we’re killing each other off. We’re killing our babies.”

Eight-year-old Royta De’Marco Giles was shot and killed in a Hoover, Alabama mall, when several men got into a fight and started shooting at each other. Giles was “caught in the crossfire,” according to a Hoover Police Department news release.

A six-year-old boy in San Francisco was shot and killed while watching fireworks. He has yet to be formally identified, but family says his name is Jace Young.

In a press briefing on Monday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out the media for failing to address the weekend’s shootings. “I’m a little dismayed that I didn’t receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend,” McEnany said at the end of the briefing, after reporters asked about the Confederate flag and the Coronavirus pandemic. “I didn’t receive one question about five children who were killed.”

Shootings And Killings Surge In Democrat-Run Cities Across the Country,"Last week, The Federalist reported on early signs of a coming violent crime wave in Atlanta, Georgia. “You ain’t seen nothing yet,” a resident stated following a murder near his home. It’s becoming clear now how predictive his statement was.

On Monday evening, Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Atlanta. A thousand National Guardsmen were deployed to quell surging violent crime across the state’s capital. The events followed the death of an eight-year-old girl in just one of 75 separate shootings across the city over the last few weeks.

“You can’t blame this on a police officer; you can’t say this is about criminal justice reform,” the city’s Democrat mayor said Sunday night. “This is about some people carrying some weapons who shot up a car with an 8-year-old baby. We are doing each other more harm than any police officer on this force.”

She, like many other Democratic city leaders across the country, had in the past weeks criticized the city’s law enforcement and stated her support for “reallocating” police spending.

Happening Across the Country

Since June, shootings and murders have surged across many of the country’s major cities. Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Nashville, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and New Orleans have all seen murders jump over 20 percent this year. The violence is heavily concentrated in the last few months, ever since protests have led to nationwide pressure on politicians to “defund” and “reimagine” policing.

Just as concerning is that these stats do not include data from the end of June and July. Data from New York and Chicago, recent data from which we do have, tells that the last few weeks have seen by far the worst of the violence. Murders and shootings in the Windy City are up about 80 percent, and New York has averaged at a 209 percent over these last weeks compared to the same times last year. It’s likely these disturbing numbers for the cities above only captures a fragment of the lives lost during unrest in which many protesters chant “Black Lives Matter.”

It’s also worth noting that Atlanta appeared to lack this crime spike just a few weeks ago, according to the statistics released above. If it serves as a bellwether, then the cities that already had a surge at the time of recording are in deep water. The scale will likely become apparent over the next few weeks.

Every one of the cities above has both a Democrat mayor and Democrat-controlled city council.

Hard Questions for Democrats

The surge in violence has drawn attention from Republican leaders. “Violence and death, which are disproportionately harming young African Americans, are tragic and unacceptable, particularly on such a shocking scale,” the White House recently stated in a letter addressed to Chicago leadership. “You continue to put your own political interests ahead of the lives, safety, and fortunes of your own citizens. The people of Chicago deserve better.”

Republican-led cities, such as Jacksonville and San Diego, have not had equivalent surges, according to the data above. As awareness spreads of the scale of the problem, it’s unlikely these criticisms will disappear. In a critical election year, this could pose a problem for Democrats making a case for left-wing policing and other policies.

The surge also raises questions about the role of existing reforms in causing the violence. Of the eight cities with the worst surges listed above, Minneapolis‘s leadership has pledged to abolish the city’s police department, while Philadelphia and New York have already cut money from law enforcement under pressure from activists. All have voiced criticism of police departments. While police chiefs in both Chicago and New York have begged city leaders to grant them greater latitude to deal with the surge, city leaders have instead taken the politically expedient route of keeping policing limited.

Combined with a public willing to attack officers making arrests, it’ll surprise few to learn that record numbers of police are abandoning their line of work, straining cut resources even further. Having more officers on the street is widely recognized to reduce crime of all stripes, and the inverse is true as well. With blue cities’ law enforcement spread thin, restrained, and lambasted by soundbite attacks, it will be difficult for politicians to dispute the link between their policies and results on the streets.

No major Democrat politician has yet come forward to address the connection.

"Black Lives Matter Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gaslighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/08/black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-07-08
Seattle City Council Plans To Slash Police Budget In Half,"The majority of the Seattle City Council say they agree with a proposal to defund the Seattle Police Department by 50 percent and reallocate the funds to other areas in the community.

“Decriminalize Seattle” and “King County Equity Now” are two new coalitions that have emerged during the recent Black Lives Matter riots calling for the defunding of police departments in Seattle.

In a presentation to the Seattle City Council’s budget committee on Wednesday, the coalition demanded the Police Department’s 2021 budget be reduced by 50 percent from the status quo (its 2020 annual budget is $409 million). Additionally, they are asking that the remaining 2020 budget be cut by 50 percent this summer.

“Decriminalize Seattle” and “King County Equity Now” introduced a four-point proposal for defunding the police department:

Remove Seattle’s 911 dispatchers from police control Scale up community-based solutions to public safety Fund a community-led process to “imagine life beyond policing.” Invest in affordable housing

Decriminalize Seattle representative, Jackie Vaughn, declared the aim of his organization is to not only “defunding the Seattle Police Department,” but also “building a world where we trust and believe in community to provide the safety that we need.”

In a letter, Senior Deputy Mayor Mike Fong begged council members to approach “re-envisioning policing” in a more “thoughtful” way.

Fong explained that the cuts would force the city to “abolish the department”.

“Some of the proposals we have heard that Council (sic) may be considering related to the current 2020 budget rebalancing effort would immediately cut as much as 25% ($100 million) or 50% ($200 million) from SPD’s budget. These blunt efforts would not serve our communities or lead to the thoughtful change needed. SPD has already spent half of its $400 million annual budget by now, so a $200 million cut (or 50% of SPD’s budget) would leave the department with zero budget remaining for 2020 and require the City to abolish the department. $100 million reduction (or 25% of SPD’s budget) would mean immediate layoffs of up to 1,000 personnel leaving Chief Best and the Seattle Police Department unable to conduct basic functions.



Seven out of nine council members are ready to vote for the reduction of police funds, even though Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan suggested in a statement from her office that she is wary of big changes. Although Durkan has been in support of reducing police funds, she appears to desire a slower approach.

In an email about the four-point proposal, Durkan spokeswoman Kelsey Nyland said, “Our office doesn’t object to any of these ideas – they are all undeniably critical to building a more just and equitable city. But each … is much more nuanced than it initially might seem, and if we don’t factor that into our discussions … then we’ll never be able to build actionable and lasting solutions.”

Durkan’s hesitation may have been influenced by a protest that was led outside her home by socialist Councilwoman Kshama Sawant. Durkan wrote to the leader of the Seattle City Council, Lorena Gonzalez, calling for Sawant to be investigated, for “recklessly undermin[ing] the safety of others”.

It’s worth noting, her concern for her own personal safety came only after Durkan fully endorsed and embraced the Capital Hill Organized Protest, CHOP, calling it a “block party”. When asked what she expected in the coming months from CHOP, she responded that it may be a “summer of love.” Things changed after two men died in the cop-free autonomous zone in the once vibrant neighborhood.

Six votes are needed to pass budget-related legislation and to override a mayoral veto.

During a remote news conference, City Council members, Tammy Morales, Kshama Sawant, Teresa Mosqueda, and M. Lorena González, joined coalition representatives and supporters who are pledging to advance the proposal.

Council Member Lisa Herbold told The Seattle Times she is committed to supporting the cuts this summer and in 2021.

Member Dan Strauss said on Twitter he is in “100% agreement” with the four-point proposal.

1/3 If I wasn’t clear yesterday – I am in 100% agreement w/ @Decrimseattle, we need to:

– Transfer 911 dispatch to being civilian led

– Create a road map for changes to be successful

– Scale up community-led organizations

– Invest in housing for all

– Define how 50% cuts occur https://t.co/GU2hlPCSpu — Councilmember Dan Strauss (@CMDanStrauss) July 9, 2020

Another member, Andrew Lewis, chimed in, “To be clear, I am 100% in favor of the (Decriminalize Seattle) demands, including the goal of a 50% cut of SPD’s budget.”

2/ To be clear, I am 100% in favor of the @DecrimSeattle demands, including the goal of a 50% cut of SPD's budget.

Lewis (@LewisforSeattle) July 10, 2020

Despite pleas from Mayor Durkan and Senior Deputy Mayor Mike Fong, the Seattle City Council appears set on implementing the four-point plan which will effectively cut the Seattle Police Department budget and terminate the force altogether.

Another Historically Violent Weekend Strikes Major U.S. Cities,"Violence continues to rise in some of the United States’ largest cities while pledges and calls to defund or cut the police department budgets become louder. In the last few months, cities such as New York City, Chicago, Portland, Minneapolis, and Houston all saw an uptick in violence, murders, and domestic abuse cases.

New York City

According to the New York Post, the city suffered another bout of “astronomical” violence after over 17 people were shot in multiple boroughs Monday.

“Those numbers would be high for a Friday or Saturday, but for a Monday they are astronomical,” one Brooklyn cop told the New York Post.

Police responded to calls of shootings, including some fatal, in Canarsie, Manhattan, Brooklyn neighborhoods over the course of the weekend well into Monday night. One of the victims, a 17-year-old who was struck in the head by a bullet, is still “clinging to life.”

Meanwhile, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio recently pledged to cut the New York City Police Department’s budget.

“The details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead,” de Blasio said. “But I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people.”

Chicago

Shootings claimed the lives of at least 11 people and injured over 64 as the summer violence levels continue to rise in Chicago. According to ABC 7 News, at least six of those injured were teenagers. One 15-year-old was also fatally shot over the weekend.

Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said the Chicago Police Department is taking extra measures to address the recent violence by adding at least 66 officers to the “summer mobile patrol unit” to increase police presence and build relationships with the community.

“We will be deploying our resources around historical data, where violence has occurred the last few weekends and historically over the last couple years, but we will be partnering with the community,” Brown told ABC 7 News.

Portland

According to Fox 12 News, Portland has also had a recent uptick in violence as the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) began investigating at least 4 homicides in three days over the last week.

Earlier in the month, the PPB reported a 240 percent increase in shootings in the city since July 2019.

“Gun violence negatively impacts everyone in our community and the increase we are seeing is alarming,” said Chief Chuck Lovell. “[Portland Police Bureau] continues to investigate these crimes and we ask for the public’s help with tips and leads.”

Portland was one of the many cities that pledged to cut its funding of police departments in light of George Floyd’s death and “Defund the Police” campaigns circulated. According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, the Portland city council approved a $15 million cut to the PPB’s budget and may consider more due to public pressure.

Minneapolis

At least 8 were injured and one was dead after a string of shootings on Friday night in Minneapolis. According to WCCO 4 CBS, this comes just a few days after another deadly night in Minneapolis with two dead and at least five injured.

“Embrace the sanctity of life,” officer Garrett Parten, a spokesman for Minneapolis police told WCCO 4 CBS. “Certainly, we as officers and the police department will do everything we can in investigating and doing what we can to prevent.”

Minneapolis was one of the first cities to unanimously pass a resolution calling for a removal and replacement of the Minneapolis Police Department. The Minneapolis City Council passed the resolution with “the intent to create a transformative new model for cultivating safety in our city.”

Houston

According to KPRC 2, at least fatal domestic violence incidents happened over the last three days in the city. In addition to shootings related to domestic violence, the Houston Police Department also reports there is a 37 percent increase in murders in the area since last year.

“We know there’s been a lot of uptick in violence in terms of the drug trafficking and murders related to drug trafficking and the drug market,” Houston Chief of Police Art Acevedo said.

Black Lives Matter Is Not A Peaceful Protest Group,"Wisconsin police say a Mexican man intentionally drove his truck into a motorcyclist earlier this month for the sole purpose of killing a white person.

According to the criminal complaint reviewed by local Green Bay outlet NBC26 charging Daniel Navarro with a hate crime, “Navarro stated that if Trump and white people are going to create a world like we are living in then he has no choice and people are going to have to die.”

Police say the victim, Philip Thiessen, 55, a former Marine, police officer, special agent, and regular volunteer at a local food pantry, died on the scene.

According to the criminal complaint, Navarro deliberately ran his truck into a motorcyclist as opposed to a car because “he wanted the person to die and not be paralyzed.” The complaint also says Navarro perceived Harley culture as brimming with white supremacists.

Further south in Indianapolis, the downtown canal saw its second homicide within a week after an argument broke out. One group offended over the term “all lives matter” shot and killed the mother of a 3-year-old on Sunday.

In Detroit, new Black Lives Matter protests erupted last week demanding “justice” and taking action against local law enforcement that shot and killed a black man who had opened fire on officers first at point-blank.

“Justice for Hakim Littleton! Fire and jail the killer cop!” shouted hundreds of demonstrators outside the 12th precinct headquarters for police, according to the Detroit News.

It doesn’t seem to matter that bodycam footage showed Littleton first firing at police arresting an associate, because in the eyes of the restless mob under the banner of Black Lives Matter, police are public enemy number one.

Black Lives Matter is not a peaceful protest group. It is a cultural revolutionary Marxist mob pursuing the total transformation of modern society under the new woke world order. In reality, Black Lives Matter don’t actually care about black lives, otherwise there would be more outrage over recent spikes in community violence leaving more black people dead rather than chasing an anarchic quest to “defund police” that will demoralize law enforcement and increase homicides.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying ‘black lives matter,'” said John Ayala, who lost his granddaughter to a shooting in Washington D.C. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of Minneapolis police, Black Lives Matter have exposed its true colors as an anarchic movement terrorizing the nation. Within the last three months, mob rioters have burned down minority businesses, destroyed minority neighborhoods, killed a black police chief, desecrated civil rights monuments, launched deadly occupations of downtown centers, and set fire to churches.

“You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said an Atlanta resident said after a murder near his own home, where Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency and called up the National Guard to address an epidemic of violence.

While merely exacerbated in the apocalyptical year of 2020, Black Lives Matter has always been violent. Its leaders knew it. Activists knew it. Politicians knew it. And the media knew it, but legacy media wouldn’t dare report it. To the contrary, the media will literally stand in front of a burning police precinct and characterize the demonstrators as “mostly a protest.”

""This mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started."" MSNBC reporter says protests in Minneapolis are not ""generally speaking, unruly"" as buildings burn in the background. pic.twitter.com/IzzEmKgxhM — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 29, 2020

At least he qualified with “mostly.”

While exhaustively rushing to cover protests as peaceful demonstrations of the oppressed courageously standing up to political power which just happen to sometimes result in the combustion of buildings, the disappearance of items from small businesses, and shooting of police, the media was rushing to condemn any who exposed their malicious lies with ill-fated attempts at de-platforming opponents.

Just a few weeks prior to Floyd’s death, after which it would celebrate the protests, corporate media was raising hysteria over lockdown demonstrations calling Americans who protested for their freedoms reckless, suicidal, selfish, racist because they could spread the virus to black people, undeserving of medical attention, irresponsibly spreading the virus, and dangerous.

The coverage of the “social justice” riots also mark a stark contrast from the way Tea Party protests were depicted by Democrats and the media nearly a decade ago.

In 2011, former Vice President Joe Biden said Americans protesting the nation’s troubling high deficit were “acting like terrorists,” and the coverage of Tea Party demonstrations were so mischaracterized a year earlier that Breitbart founder, Andrew Breitbart offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could prove demonstrators had shouted the N-word at the Congressional Black Caucus.

One can easily imagine what the media coverage ought to look like if the Tea Party engaged in the kind of widespread destruction left behind by Black Lives Matter. It’s all proof that America’s corporate media does not report, it attempts to manipulate the public for dangerous partisan gain.

"Instead Of Arresting Mob, St. Louis Confiscates Couple’s Unused Rifle","Imagine the tremendous fear one would feel watching as a group of individuals destroyed the wrought-iron gate protecting one’s private community. This fear would quickly turn into terror as a mob of Black Lives Matter members 300 strong began to flow through the breach into the neighborhood.

One’s first reaction would surely be to call the police. But what if the police never came?

This was the situation Mark and Patricia McCloskey, both attorneys, were confronted with on the evening of June 28. When the couple saw that several members of this group were armed, they called 911, grabbed their legally owned firearms, and faced the mob that had trespassed on their property and allegedly threatened to kill them and burn down their home.

The police never showed up. According to St. Louis’ KMOV4, police claim no 911 calls had been received from that street during the time of the incident. In the absence of the police protection U.S. citizens have come to expect, the McCloskeys, armed with a rifle and a pistol, were forced to fend for themselves.

This last Friday evening, St. Louis police executed a search warrant at the McCloskey home. The police seized the rifle Mr. McCloskey had held during the encounter and were told that the pistol used by his wife was in the possession of their attorney. The Federalist’s Kylee Zempel reported on this story here.

BREAKING: Sources tell Five On Your Side police seized one of the weapons, the rifle, from the couple and they told police their attorney has the pistol seen in photos. https://t.co/MMUWIz7iJs — KSDK News (@ksdknews) July 11, 2020

Mark McCloskey joined Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Monday night to discuss his situation. He told Carlson “the rumor is that we are going to be indicted shortly.”

Regarding the police officers who executed the search warrant and confiscated his rifle on Friday night, McCloskey said the police, “unfortunately, are stuck between a circuit attorney [Kim Gardner] that wants to prosecute us, and their own belief that we did nothing wrong.”

McCloskey explained that “when you have certain elements of society encouraging violence, [and] at the same time asking the police to stand down, what’s the only possible result? The only possible solution is for individual citizens to stand up to defend themselves, and I’m afraid what’s being promoted is causing citizens to stand up and defend themselves so they can be chilled and abused the way we have been.”

Although the use of firearms to protect one’s life and property is the reason our founders included the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights, leftists are questioning the couple’s actions. Saint Louis lawyer John Amman succinctly sums up their position. The homeowners’ actions “could possibly be classified as assault by putting protesters in fear of their safety…People have a right to threaten force if they are threatened. However, if a group of protesters is walking by a home and not doing anything to the homeowners specifically, then they don’t have the right to threaten lethal force without an imminent threat.”

Let’s get this straight. Amman is concerned that the St. Louis couple who protected their home after a group of 300 BLM members had just broken down an iron gate to enter their private community illegally may have put members of the mob in fear for their safety. Is he kidding us?

The woman behind the search warrant is far-left St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner. According to Fox News, Gardner’s 2016 campaign was backed by far-left billionaire George Soros.

Gardner was one of four candidates on the primary ballot in the St. Louis circuit attorney race. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a new campaign ad had been financed by The Safety & Justice Committee (SJC), a Washington, D.C. super PAC that was “at least partly funded by” Soros. The Post-Dispatch noted that the super PAC had been “established in June [2016] and reported $30,000 in initial funds from Soros. No other contributors were listed as of its last public filing June 30.”

On their June 30 quarterly statement, Gardner’s campaign reported a $67,693.23 in-kind contribution from the super PAC. Further, The Post-Dispatch revealed: “On July 26, Gardner’s campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission a $24,548.37 in-kind donation from the same federal campaign committee, a day after reporting a $25,738.86 contribution from that super PAC. Then on July 29, Gardner reported an additional $72,770.27 from Safety & Justice, bringing the Soros-backed super PAC total contribution to Gardner’s campaign to at least $190,750.73.”

These dollar amounts may not sound like much, however, this was a local race and the SJC contributions “more than doubled Gardner’s campaign cash.”

Questioned about the SJC donations, Gardner emphasized that their mission aligned with hers. She said SJC had “reached out and heard my platform and liked what I was saying about building trust. They said they’d like to support me and get my message out.”

The Soros connection is relevant because Gardner is up for reelection in November. Making an issue of the McCloskey’s threat of lethal force against a BLM group would impress SJC decision makers and could lead to additional financial assistance.

The day after the June 28 incident, Gardner’s office issued a statement that read:

I am alarmed at the events that occurred over the weekend, where peaceful protesters were met by guns and a violent assault. We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated. My office is currently working with the public and the police to investigate these events. Make no mistake: We will not tolerate the use of force against those exercising their First Amendment rights and will use the full power of Missouri law to hold people accountable.

Incredibly, many on the left agree with Amman and Gardner. Trying to gain an understanding of how a victim can suddenly become a villain, I watched a discussion among the ladies of ABC’s “The View.”

Co-host Joy Behar said there were a lot more questions than answers in this episode: “If I were a protestor, I wouldn’t appreciate having an AR-15 pointed my way or a woman, who seemed crazed, with her finger on the trigger…They [the McCloskeys] claim they are BLM supporters. Well, in that case, why not go out to these supporters and say, ‘I appreciate that you’re protesting. I agree with you.’ Acknowledge what they’re doing and lend a hand…neutralize the possibility of violence. She had her finger on the trigger, this woman.”

Co-host Sunny Hostin acknowledged that Missouri is an open-carry state for firearms but noted “the issue is it would be a crime to brandish a weapon in a threatening manner. That is actually a felony.” Hostin asked, if the McCloskeys felt threatened by the protestors, why didn’t they stay inside their home and call the police? (The rest of this discussion can be viewed here.)

Sorry ladies, but a mob of 300 BLM members trespassing through a private neighborhood forfeits their claim to the term “protestors.” The remedies Behar and Hostin suggest are just plain foolish. The McCloskeys told reporters that once they noticed two members of the mob were armed, they armed themselves and called 911. As mentioned earlier, the police never came.

Describing the experience to reporters, Mark McCloskey said, “It was like the storming of the Bastille, the gate came down and a large crowd of angry, aggressive people poured through. I was terrified that we’d be murdered within seconds. Our house would be burned down, our pets would be killed.” He added, “One fellow standing right in front of me pulled out two pistol magazines, clicked them together and said ‘You’re next.’”

Police said that when the McCloskeys demanded that the group leave their property, they “began yelling obscenities and threats of harm to both victims.”

Last Monday night, Patricia McCloskey told Sean Hannity: “[They said] that they were going to kill us. They were going to come in there. They were going to burn down the house. They were going to be living in our house after I was dead, and they were pointing to different rooms and said, ‘That’s going to be my bedroom and that’s going to be the living room and I’m going to be taking a shower in that room.’”

The BLM group members are not the victims we need to protect here. The McCloskeys were entirely justified in their actions. Gardner’s concern over the couple’s threat of force against the “peaceful protestors” is just another politically motivated lie.

It will likely have the unintended effect of adding to the recent spike in firearm sales. Situations like this are precisely why Americans own guns and must work to preserve our Second Amendment rights.

‘Defund The Police’ Has Increased Gun Sales And Support For Trump,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to take federal funds away from any police department that has violated the civil rights of the citizens they serve. The Minneapolis City Council agreed with calls from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) to disband the city’s police department and unanimously passed a resolution to replace the police with a “community-led public safety system.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti seeks to cut $150 million from the police budget. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced he would slash the city’s police department budget too.

Despite all these actions, some leftists are engaging in word gymnastics by stating that “defund” really means reform. Yet, in a New York Times op-ed titled “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police,” Mariame Kaba — an activist and an anti-crime organizer — clarified for Americans what “Defund the Police” means.

Kaba writes, “We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.” She criticized a police reform bill put forth by Democrats as something that was tried and failed in the past. She concluded the police couldn’t be reformed because they are always racist, violent, and “don’t catch the bad guys.”

She states, “The surest way of reducing police violence is to reduce the power of the police, by cutting budgets and the number of officers in half” as an immediate step. But don’t confuse that with her ultimate goal: “We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.”

Without the police, what should the community do to protect themselves against criminals? Kaba suggested using “community care workers” to address mental health issues and “restorative-justice models” instead of “throwing people in prison.”

Thanks to Kaba’s clarification, it seems even many of the leftist readers of The New York Times reject the call to “defund the police” once they grasp its true meaning. One comment at NYTimes.com that accrued more than 2,600 “likes” said: “This is a fantasy. You can fund all the social programs you want, you won’t eliminate crime or disorder. I appreciate law and order.”

Another one with more than 1,300 “likes” wrote: “This is a non-starter for me. Serious reform is needed. But you might as well call for abolishing hospitals or grocery stores.” A man who says he lived in the Bronx during the 1970s exclaimed he knew from firsthand experience that abolishing police is “a terrible idea.”

These readers who disagree with Kaba are not in the minority. An ABC News/Ipsos poll finds 64 percent of Americans oppose the “defund the police” movement and reject many of its goals, such as reallocating police department funding to mental health, housing, and education programs. Even 43 percent of Democrats oppose both defunding the police and reallocating funding to other causes. The poll reveals that the majority of Americans do believe that police keep them safe and a society without police is unthinkable and dangerous.

Americans Realize How Much We Need Good Police

The recent weeks of unrest across America have only served to reinforce the idea that policing is needed to maintain law and order. Americans saw that when police pull back, a movement that started with a legitimate grievance was quickly hijacked by criminals who are bent on destroying the communities and livelihoods of black and Caucasian Americans alike.

Burning down black-owned businesses, looting Louis Vuitton stores, and killing black police officers had nothing to do with finding justice for George Floyd. The combination of the pandemic, the riots, and now the calls for defunding the police have convinced many Americans that they need to become gun owners so they can protect themselves, their families, and their communities.

USA Today reports that Americans are loading up on guns and ammo in the wake of the riots. Firearm sales went up 78 percent in the last week of May, compared to the same time in 2019. The online ammunition website Ammo.com saw a 602 percent increase in revenue since the pandemic.

The International Firearm Specialist Academy website saw a 50 percent rise in first-time gun owners taking online training classes. The FBI reported more than 3 million background checks in May, the highest for on record for that month. Gun and ammo manufacturers and retail shops expect sales to remain strong in June too.

Gun restriction has long been a top issue in the Democratic Party’s platform. During the Democrat presidential primary race, all candidates advocated for strict gun laws including universal background checks and the banning of assault weapons. The recent surge of firearm sales presents Democrats a dilemma: they can’t call for defunding the police and gun control at the same time. Democrats have to choose one.

If they keep supporting the “defund the police” movement, Democrats will lose on the gun control issue because when Americans hear “defunding the police,” they hear government giving up enforcing laws and protecting law-abiding citizens. They envision a lawless world where no one will help them when criminals rob their houses or attempt to rape women.

Americans don’t need any data (although there is plenty) to tell them that when police retreat, crime spikes. As long as there is a persistent call for defunding the police, Americans will take matters into their own hands by becoming gun owners and Democrats will fail to win hearts and minds on the gun control issue.

Voters Will Turn to Trump For Law and Order

The “Defund the Police” movement has not only turned more Americans into gun owners and supporters for the Second Amendment, but may prove to be a boon for President Trump’s reelection campaign. Since downtown Oakland saw some of the worst riots and looting in the nation, I recently checked in with a friend who lives there to make sure she and her family are safe.

Like me, she’s an immigrant from China and experienced Chairman Mao Zedong’s “Cultural Revolution” when growing up. Unlike me, she has supported Democrats for years. She loathes everything Trump stands for, from his immigration rhetoric to positions on foreign policy. For the sake of our friendship, we typically avoid discussing domestic politics as well.

This time, however, she went straight to domestic politics. She told me she and her family were safe but the riots and looting in downtown Oakland were terrifying. She was heartbroken to see so many immigrant-owned “mom and pop” stores ransacked or even burned to the ground.

She conveyed that while she wanted to see justice for Floyd, night after night of destruction and lawlessness were just “too much.” They reminded her of China’s “Cultural Revolution” from 1966-1976. She told me: “I didn’t come all this way to America to re-live a ‘Cultural Revolution’ in 2020.” Then she said something I would never have thought she’d say before: “Trump is right. We need law and order.”

She’s not the only longtime Democrat who is deeply troubled by the call to get rid of the police. Bill Maher, the host of “Real Time,” also blasted Democrats for their call to “defend the police.” “That’s so ‘Democrats’ for you,” said Maher, “You know, they must have meetings to be this f—ing stupid about politics. ‘Hey guys, we’re making some headway here, how could we turn this into something that makes people have to vote for Trump?’”

There is probably a silent majority of level-headed Americans, who, like my friend, are sick to their stomach to see the injustice and brutality that Floyd suffered. They demand justice for Floyd and serious reform for our nation’s police force.

What’s equally important to this silent majority, however, is that they don’t want to continue to experience constant chaos, lawlessness, and destruction. Many probably are troubled by some of the president’s tweets and disagree with him on a number of issues. But if the choice this November is between “Defund the Police” and “Law and Order,” many will hold their nose and vote for Trump.

Media Attacks Trump For A Factual Statement About Law Enforcement And Race,"The media is famous for its attempts to completely assassinate and misconstrue Trump’s words to benefit its agenda and this week was no exception.

In an interview with CBS, reporter Catherine Herridge asked Trump why black people are still dying at the hands of law enforcement. Trump responded by saying that more white people are actually killed by police every year. He also noted that he thought the question was “terrible.”

President Trump tells @CBS_Herridge that “more White people” are dying at the hands of police than Black people. Watch excerpts on CBSN, more tonight on @CBSEveningNews and tomorrow on @CBSThisMorning https://t.co/NeBLT0LG0p pic.twitter.com/XIwyARJBBl — CBS News (@CBSNews) July 14, 2020

According to Statista, Trump’s statement is true: more white people are killed by police every year in total. In just 2020, 204 white people and 105 black people were fatally shot to death by police in the U.S.

In addition, the FBI data published in the Uniform Crime Report shows that white people are far more likely to be arrested than black people.

“In 2018, 69.0 percent of all individuals arrested were White, 27.4 percent were Black or African American, and 3.6 percent were of other races,” the report reads.

A mathematical breakdown of data collected by multiple sources and published in The Boston Globe shows that the percentage of white people likely to be killed by the police is higher in situations where “white people tend to encounter the police in more grave situations.”

Almost immediately after Trump’s comments aired, reporters and others punched on his statement and began misconstruing it. Many of them mistook the statement and cited the fact that black people are more likely to be killed by police instead of acknowledging that Trump’s statement was referring to totals instead of rates.

“‘What a terrible question to ask,’ Trump says, when asked by ⁦@CBS_Herridge⁩ why Black people are still dying at the hands of law enforcement,” tweeted a CBS reporter.

“The president asserts that ‘more’ White people are killed by police than Black people,” wrote New York Times reporter Maggie Habberman, whose description of the president’s line conveys his statement was not a fact.

Twitter also dedicated a news alert page dedicated to the statements and reaction from journalists to “share data” about the statement.

While one MSNBC reporter even acknowledged that Trump’s statement was true, he still proceeded to criticize him.

“It is true that police in the US also kill a lot of white people which is…not really necessarily a super awesome debating point in the police’s favor?” wrote MSNBC’s Chris Hayes.

Others, however, saw the hypocritical treatment Trump received for the statement from the media right away.

“It’s not merely an assertion; it’s a fact. We’re only surprised by the facts—when someone dares to utter them—because we’ve been brainwashed by the media to believe lies,” one user quipped.

“I’m confused, what’s the problem? That’s factually accurate,” wrote another.

“This is factual. Now—% wise? No. Black people are more likely to be killed than whites based on their population size. But in order to know whether this is disproportionate, you don’t look at population. You look at crime rates and police interactions of whites vs blacks,” another tweeted.

“Trump’s instinct that Americans are tired of the media dividing us into racial groups every 5 minutes is correct. He should stick to it,” quipped David Marcus.

Just this month, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN and others criticized and misconstrued President Trump’s speech at Mount Rushmore celebrating Independence Day calling it “dark and divisive” and “inflammatory” despite his words celebrating the Founding Fathers.

‘I’m… At A Loss For Words’: The Unraveling Narrative Behind The Atlantic’s Defund-The-Police ‘Shooting’ Tale,"When social justice activist and lawyer Derecka Purnell was just 12 years old, she and her sister watched a police officer shoot a young boy in a city recreation center because he had ignored the basketball sign-in sheet. This jarring, emotional, and deeply unsettling story was published July 6 at The Atlantic, in the section reserved for ideas, under the bold, attention-grabbing headline, “How I Became a Police Abolitionist.”

Purnell’s deeply personal story of shattered innocence and shattered bones at the end of a policeman’s gun was shared widely among top journalists and activists. “I started her article thinking abolition was impossible and ending thinking it must happen,” the president of a social justice think tank at Harvard wrote on Twitter, quoting his mother. “This is a beautifully written piece,” the Atlantic’s constitutional law editor agreed. “Derecka is the future,” an activist journalism executive declared.

There’s a major problem with Purnell’s story, however. Based on a Federalist investigation of newspaper archives and the police department records, and questions to The Atlantic, the police union, and the office of the mayor, it does not appear to have ever happened.

An Investigation

“The first shooting I witnessed was by a cop,” Purnell, a widely published Harvard Law and Berkeley graduate who is now a columnist for The Guardian, writes. “I was 12. He was angry that his cousin skipped a sign-in sheet at my neighborhood recreation center. I was teaching my sister how to shoot free throws when the officer stormed in alongside the court, drew his weapon, and shot the boy in the arm. My sister and I hid in the locker room for hours afterward.”

“The officer,” she continues, “was back at work the following week.”

Purnell has led a prolific career, including writing for The New York Times and time at the helm of The Harvard Journal of African American Public Policy. Because of her impressive rise from poverty, she’s been the subject of profiles and has been asked to write more than one personal essay on why she is an activist. Despite this, and despite this memory’s seeming impact on her life, her article in The Atlantic is the first mention it ever earns in her publicly available writings. In fact, it appears to be the first mention of the incident in any publicly available record The Federalist was able to uncover.

Purnell paints her story of police dependence in the polluted and impoverished St. Louis neighborhood she lived in. “We called 911 for almost everything except snitching,” the essay opens. “Nosebleeds, gunshot wounds, asthma attacks, allergic reactions. Police accompanied the paramedics.”

“Our neighborhood made us sick. A Praxair industrial gas-storage facility was at one end of my block. A junkyard with exposed military airplane and helicopter parts was at the other. The fish-seasoning plant in our backyard did not smell as bad as the yeast from the Budweiser factory nearby. Car honks and fumes from Interstate 70 crept through my childhood bedroom window, where, if I stood on my toes, I could see the St. Louis arch.”

An Aircraft Boneyard

In The Atlantic, Purnell says she was 12 years old. While her current age is not public information, when she sat for a Kansas City Star profile in 2014 her age was reported as 24. Based on this, we can safely assume the alleged police shooting occurred between 2001 and 2003. A broad search for “police” and “recreation center” in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s archives for those years yields 37 results. Those results include voter guides, community events, feel-good stories, budget updates and all the standard business of local news coverage, but no stories remotely resembling a police officer shooting a boy.

It’s worth noting that 2001-2003 is not, say, 1971-’73 — in addition to a still meaty local media, the United States was on edge: George W. Bush was in the White House, the country was involved in one war and on its way to another, and the police state’s response to terror attacks was under close scrutiny. In all likelihood, a police officer shooting would merit at least one local news story, but it’s possible that more specifics were needed.

Due to confused memories or exaggerations in her story, her neighborhood is a difficult place to nail down despite the vivid details. In numerous profiles and biographies, including the Kansas City Star profile, she is described as living on the south side of St. Louis, Missouri, though she has also said she was moved around traumatic foster homes in her childhood. While Route I-70, which she says she lived in the fumes of, for example, runs through the northern part of the city, the Budweiser factory is four miles south of its closest bend.

Additionally, there are multiple Praxair stores in the city (and no longer any industrial storage facility). A strong clue, however, lies in the “junkyard with exposed military airplane and helicopter parts at the other” end of her block. A military aircraft boneyard in plain sight in a city is a rare thing.

Indeed, there is a place that fits the bill in the south side of St. Louis that can be seen from Google Earth. Though its proud owner would disagree with Purnell’s description of the collection of old military aircraft he has been building since the early ’90s, it’s easy to see how a child might think otherwise.

Just a three-minute walk up the road sits Andy’s Seasoning, a multi-generation family business specializing in fish seasoning. While it is not the only spice manufacturer in the city, it is the only one focused mainly on the fish seasoning, which Purnell mentions being manufactured “in our backyard.”

And a mile down the road is a burnt-out lot that in the 2001-2003 time-frame housed “a Praxair industrial gas-storage facility.” The lot is burnt out and abandoned because in 2005, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, the facility exploded in a massive ball of flame, shaking “the surrounding neighborhood,” shooting “debris like missiles” throughout the area, delaying the Cardinals game over a mile away, triggering a fatal asthma attack in one resident, and spreading fear of asbestos and other deadly chemicals through the city.

The fish seasoning plant and airplanes aren’t exactly at the end of a block, but at 3/4 of a mile apart, they’re close enough to enclose a neighborhood. And while the fish seasoning plant isn’t in the backyard of any residential homes, it’s just two and a half short blocks from the outskirts of the neighborhood.

Purnell must have misremembered the name of the interstate that “car honks and fumes crept though [her] childhood window,” but Interstate-64 is just half a mile north, joining the railroad to wall the neighborhood off from the city’s center. And while the Budweiser factory was that smell she says overpowered the backyard fish seasoning is over two miles away by air, its prominent place in St. Louis history deserves mention in any story of the city.

Based on the vivid-if-imprecise description of her neighborhood, her “neighborhood recreation center” was most likely the Buder Recreation Center. Having a location allowed The Federalist to launch a Sunshine Law records request with the St. Louis Police Department, but just in case the sisters had attended a different rec center, there was one more that could be walked to from the general neighborhood without having to cross a major highway. Both community centers were included in the records request.

The results, though, do not support a shooting, and certainly not one involving a police officer shooting an unarmed child in front of witnesses.

Between 2001 and 2003, there were 23 police responses to the Buder Recreation Center and 38 to the 12th & Park Recreation Center. The nature of the calls cover a range of incidents, from accidents to domestic disputes, from pedestrians in need to suspicious vehicles, from larceny to arson. None of the police responses, however, involved a shooting except perhaps one attempted suicide at the 12th & Park rec center.

“I’m a little bit at a loss for words here because the shooting of a young boy by a cop in a St. Louis rec center, even if it had happened 20 years ago, I feel like that would be in my mind somewhere,” mayoral spokesman Jacob Long, a former reporter, told The Federalist over the phone. “That does not sound remotely familiar, and I’m from here … I was here in 2001, 2002, 2003.”

“You went to the right place to try and verify that incident, the police department,” he added, independently identifying the neighborhood The Federalist identified, based on the article’s description. “The current mayor wasn’t even the mayor at that time.”

“That predates my tenure here but I don’t remember that even as a consumer of local news.” Jeff Roorda, a former police officer, Democratic state representative, and current executive director of the St. Louis Police Officers Association, added in an email.

The Federalist sent two emails to Yoni Appelbaum, The Atlantic’s editor of the Ideas section, asking if the magazine fact-checked the claim:

…can you detail the fact-checking process for this story? IE which editor was tasked with confirming the details alleged in the story? Did The Atlantic verify the details of the shooting with local authorities? Did The Atlantic speak to any other eyewitnesses to the alleged shooting, or to any witnesses who recalled the incident and corroborate the claims made by the author of the story? Did The Atlantic speak to the police officer allegedly involved in the shooting, or to any of his representatives, legal or otherwise, prior to publishing the story? Can you provide the name of the officer responsible for the alleged shooting? Can you provide the name of the recreation center where this allegedly happened? Can you provide a police report of the incident? Can you provide the date of the shooting?

Appelbaum did not respond. On Friday morning after publishing, Purnell responded to a Thursday afternoon request for “any other stories or corroboration of this incident,” writing, “Hi Chris – the Atlantic found it. Take care.” The Federalist sent a follow-up to Appelbaum inquiring on if he this is true, and if he plans to answer any of Thursday’s questions. He has still not replied.

In her essay, Purnell used the story of the shooting to ask readers to consider the innocent victims of policing, going on to make the case for abolishing the police. If her ideas had been implemented before her experience, she writes, “I wouldn’t have hid in the locker room for hours because of a police shooting, and maybe my sister would have a better jump shot.”

This post has been updated to include Purnell’s Friday morning response, and The Federalist’s follow-up to Appelbaum.

Why Is Hillary Clinton Support In 2016 Correlated With Cities’ 2020 Riots?,"Image Credit Lorie Shaull / Flickr

In a soon-to-be-released book, Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan says when President Obama called him during the 2015 riots in Baltimore, he expected the president to offer federal assistance. Instead, Obama urged Hogan to back off.

Hogan ignored Obama’s advice about the violence following the death of Freddie Gray, and worked to restore order to the state’s largest city. More than $20 million of damage was done after Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told reporters the city would provide space to “those who wished to destroy.”

If Baltimore’s Democrat leaders gave $20 million of “space to destroy” in 2015, the price tag ballooned 100-fold in cities governed by the hard left in the 2020 round of urban violence.

The left and major media say the urban violence often accompanying protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 is a direct descendant of America’s past paroxysms of racial unrest. As such, the looting and arson in major cities is claimed to be the righteous child of Baltimore (2015), Ferguson (2014), Los Angeles (1992), and even the widespread riots in America’s major cities following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

But is it really? Or could it be something entirely different?

In past urban riots, a single spark ignited a mixture of anger and resentment over racial discrimination, poverty, or police brutality. When the cities burned, the damage concentrated in and around the neighborhoods of the urban poor. I witnessed this first-hand as an Army National Guard officer deployed to Los Angeles in 1992. The city was calm in the morning, and by the evening there were widespread murders with businesses being looted and burned.

In 2020, Floyd’s death appeared to trigger something different. Rather than a spark, a signal flare was sent aloft, with prepared cadres launching protests in cities across the nation often followed by violence late into the night.

Unlike Baltimore in 2015, cities like Minneapolis and Seattle featured leftwing mayors and governors, none of whom appeared interested in restoring order. This was due to those elected officials’ deep sympathy towards the protesters’ stated goals: defund the police, or, at the very least, reduce the apparent incidence of police brutality while shifting public funds out of law enforcement to more social welfare spending.

While the protests are ostensibly about the police, including accusations of routine police brutality and racist law enforcement practices, this claim can be subjected to a statistical test. For instance, are cities that spend more on police, resulting in a higher number of police per capita, more prone to violent protests in reaction to perceived over-policing?

Similarly, might cities with a high percentage of black residents have a larger share of their population that may harbor anger at their treatment by law enforcement? Or are cities with high crime rates that routinely feature violent interaction between neighborhood criminals and law enforcement stoking resentment against the police? Lastly, might poverty be a driving factor, with poorer urban areas leading to anger among the residents about the lack of opportunity?

Let’s Run the Numbers

The number of police per capita, the share of the black population, violent crime rates, and poverty levels are routinely reported by the FBI and Census Bureau. It is also possible to estimate recent urban violence by measuring protest news coverage in 37 of America’s big cities when a story also mentions “violence,” “looting,” or “arson” in the period from May 26 to June 30, and then factoring for a city’s population.

(The cities analyzed total 41.5 million people in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Madison, Miami, New York, Newark, Oakland, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, and Washington D.C. Minneapolis was excluded since many news stories included mention of Minneapolis in stories about local unrest.)

Comparing the above factors in a multivariate regression analysis with the incidence of violence as the dependent variable shows a statistically noisy and weak link to the number of police.

Of note, considering an additional variable—the share of a city’s population with a college degree or post-graduate degree—generates an even higher correlation to violence than does police per capita, suggesting that the protests and allied rioting are not the result of a working-class movement.

But none of these factors is convincingly determinative. There was one variable that did correlate strongly to urban violence: a city’s percentage of vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The more a city voted for Clinton, the more violence it saw in conjunction with the protests. (For the statisticians, the regression provides a significance of 0.0019 with the 2016 vote variable yielding a P-value of 0.003). The greater percentage of support for Clinton in 2016, the more likely a city was to suffer wanton destruction in connection with the “mostly peaceful” protests.

The figure below displays the simple correlation between urban violence and the 2016 Clinton vote.

Tellingly, out of the top ten cities for violence, looting, and arson, the average vote for Clinton was 77 percent. In the ten cities with the least destruction, Clinton won 53 percent of the vote.

That a city’s political leanings are more likely to lead to a breakdown in law and order in service of political protest shouldn’t be a surprise. In this, Seattle, with a black population of 7 percent, San Francisco (5 percent), Portland, Oregon (6 percent), and Madison, Wisconsin (7 percent) have one big thing in common with Washington D.C. and Atlanta, with black populations of 47 percent and 52 percent, respectively: They are all governed by the far-left.

Why did the leaders of the hardest-hit cities decide to give space to destroy? Some mayors saw the protest organizers as political supporters. A few may have calculated that widespread coverage of burning cities would harm President Trump’s reelection chances. And some just didn’t want the responsibility of ordering their police to restore order.

Unfortunately, it is often the case in politics and revolutions that the common people—the proletariat—are sacrificed for the movement. In this case, it will be those living in dangerous neighborhoods who will end up being murdered, robbed, raped, and extorted in greater numbers if the misguided call to “defund the police” becomes a widespread reality.

Americans have largely forgotten the hard-won gains made in public safety since 1992, during the last peak of violent crime. If crime rises to the level of a generation ago, we would suffer 14,261 more murders (almost double those murdered in 2018), 580,460 more robberies, and 636,038 more aggravated assaults every year. And these crimes would be concentrated in our urban centers, specifically in working-class and poor neighborhoods.

Think about that the next time you see those young vanguards of the proletariat, armed with law degrees and Molotov cocktails, visiting violence upon a city, only to return to their expensive lofts with a city view before daybreak. In this, the leaders of our recent round of urban violence appear to be trying to ignite a revolution rather than merely win a campaign.

Don’t Defund The Police; Fund And Defend Them,"Despite the media’s constant attention to the “defund the police” campaign, the movement remains extremely unpopular. A recent Politico/Morning Consult poll, conducted after weeks of protests, showed solid support for certain policing reforms, but voters overwhelmingly rejected the idea of defunding the police by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. It is notable that Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., the powerful chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has called the “defund the police” campaign “one of the worst slogans ever.”

Very little attention, however, has been paid to law enforcement leaders who are burning the candle at both ends, balancing their gut-wrenching public safety duties with efforts to ensure public health in the wake of COVID-19. When jails and prisons were discovered to be the most significant hot spots for the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, endangering the lives of people who live and work in those facilities, as well as their entire surrounding communities, law enforcement leaders on the front lines acted to save lives.

While some states recklessly released prisoners who posed significant public safety risks, Kentucky did not. Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice John Minton recently testified before a state legislative committee that recidivism rates, or the incidents of individuals recommitting crime, were extremely low among those released in the state.

In Kentucky alone, police officers, prosecutors, correctional officials, judges, and public defenders worked together to safely reduce the number of people in jails and prisons. Low-level, non-violent offenders deemed not a threat to public safety were diverted from incarceration to alternative options such as treatment, and police officers issued citations in lieu of arresting people for petty crimes. This swift, responsible approach to public safety during a global pandemic resulted in lives saved.

Thankfully, this seems to be the majority approach taken across the country. In April, the Arkansas Board of Corrections voted to make more than 1,200 inmates immediately eligible for parole after a directive by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and Arkansas’ prison system is now below capacity for the first time since 2007. That same month in Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed 452 commutations recommended by the state’s Pardon and Parole Board to help reduce incarceration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local jurisdictions in Ohio acted swiftly when Gov. Mike DeWine stood with Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor and urged judges to reduce bonds and lower jail populations.

Those on the front lines of our justice system prioritized saving people’s lives, like good policing does every day. Law enforcement isn’t asking for our praise or accolades, but they do need our continued support — specifically in the form of emergency resources to enforce the law and ensure COVID-19 does not permeate and overwhelm our criminal justice system, causing more deaths of prisoners, officers, and people in their communities.

According to members of a task force of judges, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, lawmakers, and public defenders recently assembled to address COVID-19 challenges, federal emergency funds would be used to maintain staff, expand technology to pivot justice system processes to virtual platforms, and revive treatment options for addiction and mental health issues that have been limited or shuttered altogether due to coronavirus complications.

Congress will soon begin negotiations on another emergency relief package. This time it is likely to address liability protections for employers looking to get people back to work, resources for testing and contact tracing, and emergency funds for state and local government, including law enforcement and justice system first responders essential to ensuring public health and safety.

Any state and local government support ought to focus on the most essential function of government, the protection of public safety. Congress could use this opportunity to lift up our law enforcement officials in jurisdictions that are finding common-sense solutions, prioritizing funding for jurisdictions that acted quickly and responsibly. This would be a proper “thank you” to law enforcement leaders exercising both courage and compassion, like those in my home Commonwealth of Kentucky, and would encourage other jurisdictions to follow in their footsteps.

“Defund the police” might get clicks and bump ratings, but it is terrible policy. Congress ought to follow the lead of the American people and reject the radical and dangerous defund the police movement. Instead, lawmakers ought to use the power of the purse to incentivize best practices and continue the good work we have seen in the states.

Rioters’ ‘Defund The Police’ Push Puts Democrat Candidates On Defense,"For Theresa Greenfield, the Democratic candidate trying to unseat GOP Sen. Joni Ernst in a state President Trump won by nine points in 2016, the media’s focus over the past few months on the country’s violent racial unrest and demands to defund the police is at best a distraction from her down-to-earth Midwest “farm kid with farm kid values” campaign messaging.

With just four months left before voters go to the polls, the soft-spoken middle-aged mom and former commercial real estate broker has been focused on wooing swing rural and suburban women and older voters, with an emphasis on a traditional Democratic platform of preserving Social Security and other social safety nets. And Greenfield has a powerful personal backstory.

Her husband, Rob, a lineman at the local power company, was killed in a workplace accident years ago, and she depended on Social Security to get by as a single parent before getting a degree and becoming the president of her Des Moines-based real estate firm.

Greenfield’s campaign has been slowly gaining traction in recent months as President Trump’s poll numbers have sputtered in key battleground states, dragging down Ernst and other Republican candidates across the country. In mid-June, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed Greenfield edging Ernst by three percentage points, within the margin of error but still ahead. In late June, Trump held just a one-point lead in the state over Joe Biden.

To maintain momentum, Greenfield is trying to avoid being defined by the Democratic Party’s leftward lurch and its embrace of expansive programs like Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, as well as the Black Lives Matter campaign to defund the police. But carving out a more nuanced position hasn’t been easy. Seeing a potential vulnerability, Ernst in early June called on Greenfield to denounce the growing calls to “defund or abolish our police officers.”

For the first few weeks, Greenfield remained quiet on the police-funding issue. Meanwhile Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has taken GOP fire for changing his tune on the movement over the last few weeks. At first Biden said he didn’t support protesters’ demands to defund the police but said reforms are needed and backed a plan to condition federal aid to local police departments adhering to certain standards of behavior.

This week, during an interview with the left-wing outlet Now This, Biden said the police are over-militarized and “become the enemy” when they go into neighborhoods in armored, military-style Humvees. He also clarified in the same interview that he would “absolutely” be willing to direct police funds elsewhere to mental health care, affordable housing and other Democratic priorities.

Greenfield’s campaign spokesman on Thursday told RealClearPolitics she doesn’t view it as an either/or funding choice.

“Instead of defunding the police, Theresa believes we need real reform with more transparency and body cameras, more civilian oversight and Department of Justice reviews, and better racial bias and de-escalation training and standards, along with other long-term investments to address racial disparities in policing, housing, health care and education,” Sam Newton, her spokesman, told RealClearPolitics in a statement.

Meanwhile, Ernst has tried to highlight her law-and-order differences with Greenfield by sponsoring a bill to deny federal funds to local leaders who allow autonomous zones such as the one protesters dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ, in Seattle to operate. Ernst’s “Ending Taxpayer Funding of Anarchy Act” would block federal funds from flowing to “anarchist jurisdictions” — areas which city and local officials allow to operate independently without immediate access to police, fire, or emergency services.

“The Seattle mayor said the CHAZ was like a block party, and then we’ve had shootings there — people have been killed — and an alleged rape,” Ernst told RealClearPolitics in an interview. “When local officials aren’t allowing law enforcement, EMS, and fire services into certain areas of the city, that’s an abdication of their constitutional obligations to protect their citizens.”

“I’m pretty fired up about it — I think it’s absolutely ridiculous,” she added.

President Trump at his Fourth of July “culture war” speech at Mount Rushmore and elsewhere has pledged to “be a law-and-order president” and uphold the nation’s heritage. The president’s Twitter profile features a photo of him posing with a group of policemen in front of Air Force One.

Vice President Mike Pence continued the theme Thursday by headlining a “back the blue” campaign rally at a lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia. Pence argued that Biden would cut funding for police if elected in November. He slammed the Minneapolis City Council for defunding its police department and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for his cuts to law enforcement.

“I want you to hear this directly from me,” he said. “Under this president, and this administration, we’re not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever.”

The Trump campaign has been running an ad depicting Black Lives Matter protesters as dangerous anarchists, planning to “unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities” and “chaos in our streets.” It depicted Joe Biden as “kneeling to the left,” and predicted he would fail “to stand up to the radical leftists fighting to defund and abolish the police.”

Democrats and several media outlets have labeled Trump’s ads purposefully misleading and say the president’s campaign is distorting Biden’s position on cutting police funding. They are pushing back hard because they believe Trump’s law-and-order messaging could be very powerful in the months leading up to November, especially among suburban women and independents.

Even though polls show Trump and several GOP Senate incumbents are running behind in key states and races, Democratic strategists are worried that the national defund-the-police movement and the national “cancel culture” push is an overreach that could hurt them in swing and red-leaning states this fall.

A new Pew Research Center national poll, conducted June 16-22 and released this week, found that 73 percent of respondents thought local police funding should stay about the same or be increased, while 42 percent of African Americans and 21 percent of whites favored cutting it.

Still, the poll uncovered some shifting feelings on police — that opinions of law enforcement officials are less favorable today than they were in a similar poll Pew conducted four years ago. Some 58 percent said they believe the police do a “good” to “excellent” job of protecting the public from crime, slightly down from the 62 percent who answered that way in Pew’s 2016 survey. Additionally, two-thirds (66 percent) of those polled rejected the notion of “qualified immunity,” that individual officers should be shielded from lawsuits unless they commit clear violations of the law.

Greenfield is hardly alone in trying to side-step the defund-the-police movement while advocating more realistic responses to concerns about police brutality and racial inequality. The strong majority opposition to the defunding movement is forcing the two Senate Democrats in the toughest re-election contests to openly denounce it.

“I do not support defunding the police,” said Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat facing off against GOP combat veteran John James, when first asked about his position on the issue in early June. “The police departments are out there protecting citizens, and the overwhelming majority of law enforcement and police are protecting citizens.”

Sen. Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat considered the most vulnerable Democrat this cycle, said, “I don’t think that’s a good idea. Defunding and disbanding is not something I would ever, ever support.”

With the issue hardly fading away in recent weeks, as Black Lives Matter protests continue coast-to-coast, in early July Peters hosted an online forum on racial justice and was joined by the Michigan NAACP and former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder.

Peters said police reform is part of a “long list of issues” needed to address racial inequalities and incidents of police brutality.

While stopping short of cutting funds to law enforcement, he said more accountability is needed for officers and police departments, including a way to keep track of officers with bad records so they can’t simply move and join another department.

Peters also blasted Senate Republicans for failing to get a police reform bill passed in late June, although Peters had joined Senate Democrats in blocking discussion of the measure, sponsored by Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate.

John James, a West Point graduate and African American business owner who is challenging Peters, labeled Peters’ stance a “PR stunt.”

“Gary Peters doesn’t speak for black people. We speak for ourselves,” the Republican candidate told a Michigan news outlet.

James is attracting national GOP donors, outraising Peters for the fourth straight fundraising quarter while edging closer to him in the polls. A CNBC/Change Research survey, released July 1, found Peters ahead by 7 points, 49 percent to 42 percemt. It’s James’ second attempt to topple a sitting Democratic senator. James fell six points short of defeating Sen. Debbie Stabenow in 2018.

Several other Democratic challengers in close swing-state Senate contests also have rejected the defund-the-police movement while supporting nuanced reforms.

“This is not the approach we need,” Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut challenging GOP Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona, said in mid-June.

“We have some deep systemic issues here with racism in the country, and we’ve got to demand accountability,” said Kelly, the son of two police officers. “There needs to be a justice system that doesn’t discriminate against anyone because of their race, but I do not agree that we should defund the police.”

Kelly listed the adoption of body cameras for all police, along with the need for more transparency and independent oversight, as well as employing de-escalation techniques.

“There’s a lot that can be done here. It should have been done decades ago,” Kelly said.

Cal Cunningham, the Democratic challenger leading North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis by 10 points in a recent CNBC poll, in mid-June said, “Twenty-first century policing reform will require increased investment in law enforcement, not defunding it.”

Days earlier, Tillis tweeted that “defunding law enforcement is irresponsible, would make our communities less safe and is void of common sense.”

“Anyone afraid of saying that is simply unfit to lead,” he concluded.

"Four Days Since A Story Unraveled, The Atlantic Still Refuses To Respond","Four days after the facts of a powerful, moving, and deeply personal defund-the-police story in The Atlantic began to unravel in the face of a Federalist investigation, the magazine remains silent. The investigation encompassed newspaper archives, police department records, questions to The Atlantic, the police union, and the office of the mayor, and found the city has no apparent recollection of the serious incident alleged in the magazine — and the writer and editor still have no answers.

On July 6, The Atlantic published social justice activist and lawyer Derecka Purnell’s “How I Became a Police Abolitionist,” an article that she opened with a story of the polluted neighborhood and culture of fear she grew up in, leading to the first shooting she says she’d ever witnessed: a police officer wounding a young boy in a St. Louis recreation center for skipping a basketball sign-in sheet. Purnell used the story as the base of a strident, impassioned call to abolish the police, whom she compared to slavers.

The first shooting I witnessed was by a cop. I was 12. He was angry that his cousin skipped a sign-in sheet at my neighborhood recreation center. I was teaching my sister how to shoot free throws when the officer stormed in alongside the court, drew his weapon, and shot the boy in the arm. My sister and I hid in the locker room for hours afterward. The officer was back at work the following week.

If her sweeping policy prescriptions were followed sooner, she later writes, “I wouldn’t have hid in the locker room for hours because of a police shooting, and maybe my sister would have a better jump shot.”

The article was widely shared among top journalists and activists, including Atlantic editors and reporters. Using Purnell’s cited age and vivid description of her neighborhood, The Federalist uncovered when and where the shooting she describes would have occurred, later using a deep-dive public records search to confirm the author’s age and former address on the 2600 block of Hickory Street.

A Sunshine Law request to the St. Louis Police Department was quickly answered, revealing 23 police responses to the Buder Recreation Center and 38 to the nearby 12th & Park Recreation Center between 2001 and 2003. None of the responses included anything like an officer shooting a young boy. None even involved a shooting, except perhaps one attempted suicide at the 12th & Park rec center.

Similarly, a broad, three-year search of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch turned up 37 stories mentioning both police and recreation centers, but nothing that was remotely similar to the described incident. Mayoral spokesman, former reporter, and then-resident Jacob Long told The Federalist Purnell’s claim “didn’t sound remotely familiar,” and the head of the St. Louis Police Officers Association agreed.

The article is published in the Ideas section of the magazine, but two Thursday emails and one Friday email to Ideas Editor Yoni Appelbaum have gone unanswered. On Friday morning, the author of the article responded to Thursday’s request for “any other stories or corroboration of this incident,” claiming the magazine had the evidence. “Hi Chris – the Atlantic found it,” she wrote. “Take care.” When asked about this, Appelbaum remained silent.

Appelbaum appears to have had internet access, writing five original tweets in the 36 hours since the first request was sent. The majority of the tweets are attacks on President Donald Trump, including one blaming him for school closures, one blaming him for school openings, and one on the U.S. Constitution’s apparent inability to contain “the depth of Donald Trump’s moral vacuity.”

On Friday evening, The Federalist reached out to Atlantic Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, bringing the investigation, the author’s claim, and his editor’s silence to his attention. Goldberg has yet to respond, and Purnell’s story of a police officer shooting a child in front of numerous witnesses in a seemingly unjustified attack in a city rec center remains published and without any note, clarification, or correction. In a similar vein, numerous staff tweets praising the article remain live.

While it’s unclear what kind of fact-check process articles in the Ideas section are subjected to, if any, The Atlantic’s fact-check professionalism was once storied. A 2018 essay by Atlantic Research Chief Yvonne Rolzhausen, “How To Fact-Check The Atlantic,” details the incredibly thorough process she says is typical of original reporting in the magazine. A Sunday afternoon email to Rolzhausen asks if the police abolition article was subject to her department’s oversight, and if so, who confirmed the story — and how did they confirm it. Thus far, she has not replied.

Purnell has led a prolific career, including writing for The New York Times and a stint at the helm of The Harvard Journal of African American Public Policy. Because of her impressive rise from poverty, she’s been the subject of multiple profiles and has been asked to write more than one personal essay on why she is an activist. Despite this, her article in The Atlantic appears to be the first mention of this incident in her publicly available writings.

“This story means everything to me,” Purnell wrote in a public Facebook post when the article was published. “I cried a lot while writing it. I’m crying now. Thinking about… kids I grew up with who could have been saved if we had a different world.”

“When people suggest that we don’t care about safety or violence, they forget that we are survivors of violence, too.”

Renaming The Redskins Won’t Save A Single Black Life,"So long, Redskins. The movement sparked by the death of George Floyd has, at best, a mixed record on police reform, but it is racking up victories in the struggle against statues and problematic names. Making the police better is difficult; changing the name of a football team is an easy win.

Of course, the Redskins’ name did not trouble many American Indians, quite a few of whom took pride in it. Nor was it offensive to the many black football fans in the D.C. area who support the team. Indeed, the name was the least of the team’s problems.

Rather, the real constituency against the Redskins was in places like the Washington Post newsroom — mostly white, educated, and left-wing — and they’re just getting started. There are demands and plans to rename cities, airports, schools, other sports teams (the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League are reportedly caving), and just about anything and anyone. Some leftists want to cancel saints, and some are even attacking statues of Jesus.

Destroying Symbols Doesn’t Help Anyone

These symbolic purges of the inherited wickedness of the past will not save a single black life. They will not reduce the harassment and mistreatment that black men sometimes receive from the police, which South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott spoke movingly about while promoting his police reform bill. Democrats still killed his legislation. Perhaps they would prefer to preserve the problem so they can run on it this fall, rather than work with the GOP to address it.

Meanwhile, many local changes have consisted less of making the police better than of making them rarer. Permitting rioters to run rampant allowed mobs to inflict enormous damage, undoing decades of hard-won progress, often in minority neighborhoods. Attempts by armed militants to establish police-free “autonomous zones” ended in the murders of children. Even as the riots have (mostly) subsided, many cities are suffering from spikes in horrific violent crime.

Nor will destroying symbols and renaming stuff help close racial disparities in education, employment, and income. That would require, among other hard tasks, taking on the teachers unions that block education reform.

It would also discomfit affluent white liberals, who in theory favor education opportunities for poor minority children, but in practice spend a lot of money to ensure that their own kids attend excellent schools that poor minorities cannot afford. As the libertarian writer Megan McArdle has observed, good public schools are basically private schools that come bundled with granite countertops and hardwood floors.

From riots to cancel culture, almost nothing the left has done under the banner of Black Lives Matter will prevent another murder like Floyd’s. A cynic might conclude it’s all a con. Opportunistic (often white) grifters have cashed in by selling a toxic “anti-racism,” while political opportunists have worked to graft their pre-existing causes onto the latest movement. Corporate behemoths such as the NBA have bought some cheap PR by promoting social justice as they kowtow to a Chinese regime that runs concentration camps and uses slave labor.

Redskins Renaming Nothing More Than a Religious Ritual

No doubt some people are just mouthing social justice slogans to sell products or protect themselves from the mob, but many are sincere, even if their methods are ineffective. Iconoclasm and renaming are dumb ways of advancing police reform, but they are normal during revolutions, whether in politics or religion.

There is mix of both right now, with political activism taking on aspects of a religious revival and substituting for traditional sources of meaning. The vision of a Year Zero, in which everything begins anew, is a perennial temptation that transfers religious eschatological longing to the political realm.

This impulse motivates attempts to banish evil and remake the world through linguistic re-description, as if it were possible to atone for the sins of the world by destroying monuments and adopting new nomenclature. Wise people might sometimes rename or change what they publicly honor, but they will not do so in a sanctimonious frenzy, wantonly declaring anathemas over their entire history. This magical thinking might be especially alluring to those who make their living with words, and it explains why they are trying to confront racism and systematic inequality through symbolic gestures such as renaming sports teams.

These efforts are ineffective at their stated goals of reforming the police and establishing racial justice, but that does not mean there are no mundane consequences. They are part of a broader attempt at cultural revolution. The campus crazies of a few years ago are now out in the real world; they got real jobs and are taking over Google, The New York Times, and much more.

This is why our national dialogue (if we can call it that; it often feels more like a lecture) on racial justice has been given over to the concerns and obsessions of the educated professional class and those who aspire to it. They are skilled at taking offense and detecting the smallest of transgressions, often on behalf of others, then canceling people and things. They have no idea how to reform the police to best provide the full and equal protection of the law to poor and minority citizens.

After all the protests, riots, death, and destruction, those driving the narrative think justice for George Floyd means giving D.C. football fans the opportunity to spend $29.99 on a hat with the new team name — made by Chinese slave labor.

The Conversation About Black Lives Must Stop Focusing On White People,"The tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have led to riots, civil unrest, and protests against police brutality, systemic racism, white supremacy, and what many see as a disregard for black life in America. Many protesters link the deaths of Abrey, Taylor, and Floyd to past injustices, asserting that racist whites and police pose the same threat, or worse, to black Americans today.

These passionate claims have met broad agreement from leftist elected officials, media outlets, and entertainers. The ubiquity of the claims, combined with their general lack of relevant supporting evidence, highlights a distinct peculiarity within black political culture: black leaders fight harder against white supremacy than they do for black progress.

This phenomenon manifests itself in the tendency for the black leadership class to elevate the values, beliefs, and behaviors of white people above those of black people. That is why public discourse about the obstacles facing blacks in America is dominated by things white people must fix — like “systemic racism” or “unconscious bias” — rather than things black people can control, such as their culture and values. This perverse line of thinking gives the impression that black problems only matter when white people cause them, and that white thoughts are more important than black actions.

Dangerous Omissions

By and large, the more a story can be tied to systemic racism or white supremacy, the more it will be amplified in popular culture. For instance, what started as a white woman trying to harness racial stereotypes to get a black birdwatcher in trouble with the police turned into prominent people wildly overreaching and comparing the incident to Emmett Till’s murder. What followed was a predictable chorus of columns, cable news appearances, and Twitter history lessons about how white women pose a critical threat to black men.

Actual threats to black life, by contrast, attract much less national outrage. Shootings and homicides have risen dramatically this year in large urban cities across the country, yet there seems to be more concern for performative public art projects than protecting the lives of the black people being gunned down in the bloody hellhole of Brooklyn.

Probably no one epitomizes everything wrong with the black intelligentsia more perfectly than Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson. A frequent media presence on matters of race, Dyson participated in an MSNBC panel discussion that mocked people who express concern about the impact of absent fathers on young black men, going so far as accusing them of engaging what he called the “magical black father” myth.

As a social scientist, Dyson should be supremely aware of research that shows children raised by their married biological parents do better across numerous social and economic indicators than children raised in other family arrangements. Yet, for some curious reason, he never mentioned that.

Dyson’s appearance on Fox News a few years later showed what he actually believes would improve the condition of black people. He suggested white people could set up individual reparations accounts to offset the systemic injustices they believe blacks still face in America today.

These two appearances embody the essence of this destructive worldview that is rooted this odd brand of white superiority propagated by leftists — any action by whites that appears to expose or address systemic racism, regardless of how trivial, is to be prioritized over any initiative black people take to improve our own lives, regardless of how important.

Analyzing Social Problems With Objective Facts

It may be difficult to determine the exact motivations of the individuals who engage in this behavior, but its effects on the black community are clear. Rhetoric from black leaders about black Americans being hunted down because of their race is unsupported by evidence, but the vicious cycle of misinformation, hyperbole, and social media amplification increases fear, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness.

That is why it is so important to ground any analysis of social problems in objective facts. For instance, the percentage of black-on-white homicides in 2018 was twice as high as white-on-black murders, a statistic that has been consistent for decades.

It’s also easy to debunk claims that “murderous police” and mass incarceration constitute an ongoing genocide against black people. In the past five years, about 25 percent of those shot and killed by police were black, and only 2 percent were unarmed. Yet the truth distortion caused by the media gives the impression that police only shoot unarmed black men.

In reality, nearly half of the people killed by police in the last five years have been white, including whites who have died under the weight of an officer’s knee, during a no-knock warrant operation, shot in the back, shot in their doorway with their hands up, and shot after calling the police to report a crime.

The mass incarceration narrative also crumbles under any scrutiny. Contrary to popular books like The New Jim Crow and documentaries like 13th, racist drug enforcement is not what is behind the large population of black Americans behind bars. The truth is that 61 percent of black inmates in state prisons — by far the largest part of the prison system — are there for violent crimes. Drug possession accounts for just 3 percent of the black prison population, and all drug offenses account for 13 percent of the black prison population, a rate lower than white or Hispanic offenders (16 and 14 percent, respectively).

The power of the white superiority complex held by black leaders doesn’t just come from distorting racism, but also from minimizing any issue that requires self-examination and self-correction within black culture. There is no greater example of this than the reluctance of black leaders to publicly address the decades-long disappearance of the black nuclear family. We black Americans may talk about the importance of family structure amongst ourselves, but any leader who addresses it publicly — including President Obama — is denounced by leftists and accused of engaging in “respectability politics.”

Violent crime against blacks is another issue that only inspires national attention or outrage when a white perpetrator is involved. The sad truth is that, despite being 13 percent of the population, blacks make up more than half of the nation’s homicide victims each year.

Where the race of the offender is known, blacks are also the offenders in more than 90 percent of black murder cases. While intra-racial violence is the rule for every demographic group, the homicide victimization rate for blacks is six times higher than whites, a fact that explains why, at 39 percent, homicide is the leading cause of death for black males ages 15-34.

Rejecting Permanent Victimhood

The prioritization of white beliefs and values over black ones also extends into popular culture. That is why a video of two men being arrested in Starbucks for not buying anything and ill-considered ad campaigns from H&M and Gucci inspire nationwide calls for boycotts, while a hip hop icon like Snoop Dogg can be a brand ambassador even after showing up to an award show with two women on dog leashes, bragging about his time as a pimp, and referring to a veteran black female journalist as a “funky dog head b—-.”

The black intelligentsia should have forcefully denounced these behaviors. Yet degrading black women, much like when black men are killed, is only seen as a problem when white people do it.

A black leadership class that claims to care about black lives should be spending the majority of its time trying to address the issues facing the black family and working to positively shape black culture. A venerable organization like the NAACP should be using its political capital, clout, and moral force to promote the “success sequence” while imploring black artists to stop polluting black culture instead of getting white Hollywood stars to “take responsibility” for racism. Unfortunately, many of the people claiming to care about black lives will dismiss any discussion of black culture and behavior in the black community as a diversion tactic pushed by racists to perpetuate stereotypes about black pathology.

Any political philosophy that says black people are powerless victims of society’s institutions and systems who require white people to use their autonomy, agency, and privilege to uplift blacks is held down by the black intelligentsia’s unique view of white supremacy. Suggesting whites have a greater capacity for moral reasoning, emotional regulation, and reasoned decision-making than blacks is a paternalistic and infantilizing impulse that should be rejected completely.

It doesn’t matter if the people pushing it are grievance grifters targeting guilty white liberals, anointed prophets of anti-racism who promote sophomoric ideas, or people who would trade the solid substance of black self-sufficiency for the thin gruel of white benevolence. Any social, cultural, economic, or political phenomenon that affects other groups can affect black people as well.

If out-of-wedlock births, drug abuse, and violence hurt the life prospects of white people, why wouldn’t the same be true for black people? Black activists and intellectuals frequently criticize whites about their fragility and demand they confront their values and behaviors. It’s time for them to take their own advice.

Keith Ellison Says He Doesn’t Want Police Responding To Rape Calls,"Keith Ellison, former Democrat National Committee vice chairman and current Minnesota attorney general, said he does not want police officers to respond to rape calls. The shocking policy suggestion occurred during a Zoom conversation featuring Ellison and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) to discuss racism and police reforms. The dialogue was moderated by White House correspondent for “PBS NewsHour” Yamiche Alcindor.

Ellison stated: “If you’re a woman who’s been a victim of a sexual assault, and the assailant ran away, wouldn’t you rather talk to somebody who is trained in helping you deal with what you’re dealing with, as opossed to somebody whose main training is that they know how to use a firearm? Right?”

In a tweet one user was appalled by the attorney general’s disregard for police officer capabilities, writing, “How is this guy an AG? Doesn’t he know they have special units trained to deal with sexual assault victims. What an insult – ‘their main training is how to use a weapon.’ Yes, help the victim, but catch the perp! Good grief.”

GOP rapid response director Steve Guest tweeted his prediction should Ellison and the radical left win in November, “This is Joe Biden’s Democrat Party and a reminder that you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”

A rape survivor responded to Guest’s tweet explaining, “Having been raped, I didn’t feel safe until I knew that the perpetrators were caught and was grateful for the police. Also, it was the police who directed me to community resources to help with the trauma and therapeutic resolutions. The ignorance of this man is insulting.”

https://twitter.com/thegr8maambino/status/1285245943583916033

Ellison’s desire to no longer allow police to respond to rape calls is shared by many on the left and its “defund the police” movement. A recent article by Moria Donegan in The Guardian is titled, “Who will protect you from rape without police?’ Here’s my answer to that question.” Donegan’s conclusion in the piece is, “As feminists, we must recognize that the police are more likely to hurt women than to help us.”

Ellison’s disregard for victims of violence is especially troubling given his personal history. In 2006 and 2018, Ellison was accused of physical and verbal abuse by former girlfriends. Amy Louise Alexander, who says she had an affair with Ellison while he was married to Kim Ellison, alleges the former congressman grabbed and pushed her during an argument. Ellison denies having a sexual relationship with Alexander.

In 2018, while he was campaigning to be Minnesota’s attorney general, the top legal officer of the state, more disturbing accusations of abuse surfaced. This time, former girlfriend Karen Monahan released a statement to local affiliate Fox 9. In the bombshell statement, Monahan painted a picture of a long-term relationship with Ellison that was so emotionally and physically abusive it led to Monahan acquiring a case of “complex PTSD.”

Monahan’s statement included disturbing descriptions of the abuse she says she endured. It is worth noting that this abuse allegedly occurred while Ellison was a U.S. congressman:

One night I confronted him very calm about a lie he had just told me straight to my face (sic). What happened next was a rage that I had never witnessed to that magnitude. He was becoming a person I had never seen before. The next morning, he came into the room I was sleeping in. I was laying across the bed with my headphones on, listening to podcast on my phone. He said he was about to leave town for the weekend and told me to take the trash out (sic). Given the explosive outrage that occurred the night before, I just should shook my head yes. I didn’t look up at him or saying anything (sic). That is when he tried to drag me off the bed by my legs and feet, screaming ‘b-tch you answer when I am talking to you. I said take out the trash, you’re a bad guest’ (even though we were living in the same place) (sic). He kept trying to drag me off the bed, telling me to get the f-ck out of his house, over and over. I froze. He had to leave and get on the plane. He knocked the shoe off my foot and told me I better be gone when he gets back (which was in two days).

Because of the explosive nature and timing of the accusations, Minnesota’s Democrat Party was forced to launch an investigation into the allegation. They appointed a local attorney who had links to the state party. Unsurprisingly, the attorney hired by the Democrat Party found Monahan’s abuse claim unsubstantiated. Ellison went on to become Minnesota’s first black and first Muslim AG.

Ironically, Monahan’s allegations coincided with the infamous Brett Kavanaugh investigations. Even though Justice Kavanaugh’s accuser presented zero evidence and he was ultimately exonerated, his reputation has suffered greatly from the accusation in a high-profile, high-stakes Supreme Court confirmation hearing.

Donald Trump Jr. pointed out the hypocrisy of the media’s portrayal of Kavanaugh and Ellison, whose accuser even presented medical records bolstering her claim: “Interesting how quiet the left/media (redundant I know) is on this given that there seems to be ACTUAL EVIDENCE that something happened here. Why the double standard? U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison’s ex-girlfriend posts medical record alleging abuse.”

Keith Ellison's ex-girlfriend posts medical record alleging abuse https://t.co/qXGOzewf0j — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 24, 2018

This all questions whether Ellison can be considered a credible and unbiased voice on the issue of violence against women. Since Democrats vehemently maintain that accusers should be believed regardless of evidence, by their standards Ellison has an insurmountable conflict of interest.

Atlantic Finally Admits Police Abolition Piece Is Based On A False Narrative,"“We called 911 for almost everything except snitching” reads the first line of an Atlantic article, “How I Became a Police Abolitionist,” by social justice activist and lawyer Derecka Purnell. Her deeply personal essay, first published July 6 in the Ideas section, tells of her childhood in a polluted neighborhood surrounded by violence and beset by fear, using one particularly disturbing memory of a police officer shooting their cousin, just a “boy,” in the arm for skipping the basketball sign-in sheet in front of Purnell and her sister, who had been playing basketball but were forced to hide “in the locker room for hours afterward.”

“When people dismiss abolitionists for not caring about victims or safety,” she writes, “they tend to forget that we are those victims, those survivors of violence.”

“This story means everything to me,” Purnell wrote on Facebook later that day. “I cried a lot while writing it.”

An investigation by The Federalist encompassing newspaper archives, police department records, questions to The Atlantic, the police union, and the office of the mayor, however, called the story — including facts about the neighborhood, the timeline of the incident, and if the incident described even happened at all — into question.

Four days, six comment requests, and one follow-up story later, The Atlantic issued a series of major corrections that confirmed The Federalist’s investigation — and gutted the Purnell’s story of the police violence that made her “a police abolitionist,” rendering it a story about a private security guard shooting his adult cousin. Although the updated story no longer involves personally motivated and barely punished police violence against children, it now includes mention of a police investigation. Additionally, a contemporary news article uncovered by The Federalist using the updated timeline details pending police charges against the shooter.

Someone in the neighborhood, it appears, called 911.

A Very Different Story

“The first shooting I witnessed was by a cop,” the story read from 7 a.m. on July 6 until 1:37 p.m. on July 20. It detailed a police officer shooting a “boy” on city property in front of children over a personal feud, then seemingly suffering only a short suspension from duty at that rec center:

I was 12. He was angry that his cousin skipped a sign-in sheet at my neighborhood recreation center. I was teaching my sister how to shoot free throws when the officer stormed in alongside the court, drew his weapon, and shot the boy in the arm. My sister and I hid in the locker room for hours afterward. The officer was back at work the following week.

If her prescribed abolition of police departments were followed sooner, she wrote, “I wouldn’t have hid in the locker room for hours because of a police shooting, and maybe my sister would have a better jump shot.”

The article was widely shared among top journalists and activists, including an Atlantic editor, whose praise remained online Monday night.

On Monday afternoon, The Atlantic updated the above paragraphs (material changes bolded) to read:

The first shooting I witnessed was by a uniformed security guard. I was 13. I remember that the guard was angry that his cousin skipped a sign-in sheet at my neighborhood recreation center; the victim told police it had started as an argument over ‘something stupid.’ I was teaching my sister how to shoot free throws when the guard stormed in alongside the court, drew his weapon, and shot the boy in the arm. My sister and I hid in the locker room for hours afterward. The guard was back at work the following week.

“An earlier version of this article described the shooter as ‘a cop,'” the more-material of the two Monday corrections reads. “In fact, he was an armed, uniformed security guard working at the municipal recreation center, employed by a security company under contract with the city of St. Louis. In addition, the author was 13, not 12, at the time of the incident.”

The Atlantic still refuses to share any corroborating evidence or if they did a fact-check on the original story before publication, although a search of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s archives encompassing the now-broadened timeline reveals an early-2004 shooting at Buder Recreation Center, less than three blocks from Purnell’s old address.

That article, published March 9, 2004, is titled “Security Guard Is Charged With Assault,” and reports that, “The security guard, 23, and his cousin, 18, were quarreling at the center about 4:50 p.m. [March 8] when the shooting occurred, according to Richard Wilkes, a Police Department spokesman. The victim was shot in the arm.”

“Wilkes,” the 2004 article concludes, “said there were no other injuries and no children were involved in the incident.”

When asked if The Atlantic spoke to the victim, spoke to the guard, or acquired a police report, Anna Bross, a vice president of communications at the magazine, replied, “To start, you can find coverage of the incident in local newspapers in 2004.”

The article’s title and call for police abolition remain unchanged, although the story justifying her activism is no longer about (1) a police officer shooting (2) a child (3) without serious consequences, and is about now (1) a private security guard shooting (2) an adult (3) and being charged with assault. The magazine decided police bringing charges within one day, however, was not worth mentioning — and the 18-year-old victim is still simply described as just a “boy.”

“I’ve reshared this essay with corrections about the shooting I witnessed,” Purnell tweeted more than five hours after the correction went live. “I was not 12. I was 13. The shooter was a uniformed private guard with a badge and gun. When we say abolish the police, that includes private police, too. thank you for reading <3.”

Purnell has led a prolific career, including writing for The New York Times and a stint at the helm of The Harvard Journal of African American Public Policy.

Monday afternoon Sunshine Law requests to the St. Louis Police Department and city hall on police responses to the Buder Recreation Center in March 2004, and on park employees or contractors facing discipline, had not yet been returned, although the police quickly replied that they would send records over. Missouri law gives government three days to respond to requests, and in every request the previous week, the city beat that timeline.

While still declining to say if the article was fact-checked before it was posted on July 6, and if so by who, Bross emailed that she “will keep an eye out for the significant corrections or updates to your piece(s),” referencing The Federalist investigation that fact-checked the article for them.

Black Officer Shocked At Racist Things BLM Protestors Scream At Him,"In one black Portland police officer’s frontline experience, the Black Lives Matter protests in his city are not about helping black people attain better lives. What this officer sees is privileged white kids infiltrating communities that don’t belong to them to burn stuff, break things, cause trouble, incite violence, and tell black people what they should do.

This officer, Jakhary Jackson, is a nine-year veteran of the Portland Bureau of Police. After working for Nike for 10 years, Jackson joined law enforcement to “make the most out of my life by helping others.” Both sides of his family have long Portlandian roots. Jackson works where he grew up, and his love for the people of his community is evident.

A Different Kind of Racism

During a Portland press availability, Lt. Tina Jones interviewed Jackson, simply asking him to share his experience working these protests every evening for the last few months.

I’ll say this. I got to see folks that really do want change like the rest of us, that have been impacted by racism. And then I got to see those people get faded out by people who have no idea what racism is all about, that have never experienced racism, that don’t even know that the tactics they are using are the same tactics that were used against my people.

Jackson tells of a young black woman asking him one evening, while he held the line with protesters, why he wouldn’t talk with her and her friends, why he wouldn’t engage them. He explains that young black people often ask him what he thinks of all the unrest. They want to know what he thinks about the injustice, about George Floyd’s death, about the pain resulting from killings of black men.

It isn’t Jackson’s superiors who demand he not speak, it’s the young white protestors — nearly every night. Jackson explains that when “a brother or sister” approaches him, wanting his perspective on things, white protesters jump in like clockwork to tell the inquirer, “F-ck the police. Don’t talk to him.”

“That was the most bizarre thing,” Jackson says, wincing as he tells the story. “Honestly, every time I try to have a conversation with someone that looks like me, someone white comes up and blocks them and tells them not to talk.” Jackson says the very moment he was explaining this to a young black female, “this white girl pops right in front of her” and told her not to speak.

“He just said that was gonna happen!” the black girl said, stunned, is if Jackson were a fortune teller. She looked at the white girl and said, “Why did you do you that?”

Jackson continues, relaying his conversation with the girl, who interrupted: “Then I said, straight up, ‘I’ve been called the N-word. She’s been called the N-word. Why are you talking to me this way? Why do you feel she can’t speak for herself? Why do you feel you need to speak for her when we’re having a conversation?’”

“She couldn’t answer my question,” Jackson says. “All she said was, ‘Someone told me to do it.’”

A Profile of Portland Protesters

When asked about what he and fellow black officers have been subjected to by protesters who are supposedly fighting for racial justice, Jackson tells of protesters regularly threatening his life. He’s taken multiple incoming explosives thrown by rioters, some very powerful with marbles and rocks taped to them, intended to inflict maximum and sustained damage. He saved a female officer from being hit in the head with a massive projectile that he said would certainly have killed her had he not been present.

But to Jackson and his black peers, the most painful thing is white protesters’ words. “It says something when you are at a Black Lives Matter protest, and you have more minorities on the police side than you have in a violent crowd,” Jackson says. “And you have white people screaming at black officers, ‘You have the biggest nose I’ve ever seen.’”

Jackson says he is totally “cool” with people wanting to join efforts to achieve social change. What he’s seen at the Black Lives Matter events, however, “has been very strange to watch” precisely because, as he explains, so-called anti-racism tactics have come full circle: White protesters are telling black people what is best for them. Worse, these white kids are destroying black neighborhoods while they do it.

The first images Jackson saw from the protests were white people, who Jackson says are “not even from here,” burning and looting black businesses. “They don’t even know what they’re doing,” he adds. “So that to me was very angering.”

“The community is not happy with it,” he says. “They asked for the violence to stop.” Jackson tells of his cousin who had attended a Black Lives Matter event but soon left dismayed at the violence perpetrated by white rioters, saying, “This has turned into something else. This is weird.”

Jackson tells another story of a pair of young brothers he met while they were cleaning up the street after the protesters had cleared out. Jackson and a few of his fellow offers went over to shake the boys’ hands, impressed at their efforts to restore the city. “You know,” the boys told the officers, according to Jackson, “We’re from here. This is our city. I don’t understand why people are coming here and destroying it. We want to clean it up.”

An Officer’s Reality

Jackson explains how strange it is for angry white youths to come to his community, claiming they want to help, but telling him to quit his job without knowing anything about him.

Once again, you have a privileged white person telling someone of color what to do with their life. And you don’t even know what I’ve dealt with, what these white officers you’re screaming at have dealt with. You don’t know them. You don’t know anything about them.

Jackson tells how he watches his fellow officers serve the community year after year, risking their lives each day. They do whatever it takes to care for those who have been shot, not afraid to get blood on them. He knows these officers do what they do because they care deeply about all the lives in their community, regardless of skin color.

“You see [the officers], and they are truly trying to help save someone’s life, and then are called racist by people who have never seen anything like that, who have never had to put themselves out there like that. It’s really—” Jackson takes a long pause. “It’s disgusting.”

"179 Monuments Ruined Since Protests Began, And Counting","Thirty-three statues of Columbus. Nine of the Founding Fathers. Eight of Saint Junipero Serra. With the frequency of the ongoing iconoclasm, it can be hard to gain a scale of the problem.

For each story that has breached the news cycle, at least a dozen went unreported outside of local media. This detailed list records each instance monuments have been defaced, vandalized, and or torn down since nationwide protests began, updated as more occur.

Some key takeaways include:

At least 183 monuments, memorials, statues, and major historical markers have been defaced or pulled down since protests began in May.

While Confederate monuments have taken the lion’s share of media coverage, they actually form a minority of the statues targeted.

By far the most popular target was Christopher Columbus, with 33 statues in total having been defaced and pulled down.

The next most popular targets were Robert E. Lee (9), Serra (8), and Thomas Jefferson (4).

The vast majority of the vandals were never charged, with 177 out of 183 instances having no arrests.

Most monuments torn down were not by protesters, but by city officials after pressure or threats from protesters.

By far the most common route for monuments being destroyed was for protesters to damage it, then the city quickly removing it as a “public safety” hazard, not to be returned.

For a majority of the statues removed, the fate of the artwork is currently unknown, while a minority have been moved to cemeteries and museums.

The list begins with the most recent instance of iconoclasm and continues backwards in time until the first instance connected with nationwide rioting, in late May.

A&E’s Ratings Nose-Dive After Network Bows To Mob Pressure To Cancel ‘Live PD’,"Cable television ratings for A&E Network have plummeted since it canceled the hit police reality show, “Live PD” on June 10, according to the Wall Street Journal.



Following the death of George Floyd and riots led by “Black Lives Matter” across the country, A&E Network capitulated to demands to cancel the law enforcement show saying in a statement:

“This is a critical time in our nation’s history and we have made the decision to cease production on Live PD. Going forward, we will determine if there is a clear pathway to tell the stories of both the community and the police officers whose role it is to serve them. And with that, we will be meeting with community and civil rights leaders as well as police departments.”

The woke move turned out to be a devastating financial mistake. Average prime-time viewership for A&E between June 11 and July 19 of this year was 498,000 people, which is down 49 percent from the same period last year. Additionally, for key demographics of adults 18-49 and 25-54, the declines are 55 percent and 53 percent, respectively. Before A&E pulled the show, its prime-time viewership was up 4 percent from the same period in 2019.

Ironically, the show promoted police transparency, one of the reforms championed by BLM and others, by following officers on their rounds in cities across the country. “Live PD” averaged about 1.9 million viewers for its Friday and Saturday night episodes and re-aired episodes on other days. It inspired several successful spinoff shows, which A&E also canceled.

When you include the now-canceled sister shows of Live PD, “Live PD: Police Patrol” and “Live PD Presents: PD Cam,” the Live PD universe accounted for more than 85 percent of A&E’s daily programming.

In 2019, the “Live PD” empire brought in $292.6 million in advertising, according to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media. For the first quarter of 2020, the programs sold $95.8 million in advertising.

A&E told the Journal they expected this “temporary hit in the ratings” given the success of “Live PD” and that it has been mostly replaced by reruns. The network expressed its confidence in being able to “find new hits and reinvent ourselves.”

“Live PD” fans, self-named “Live PD Nation,” have been actively encouraging a boycott of A&E until “Live PD” and it’s spin-offs return to the network.

Last month, Paramount Network canceled “Cops,” another police reality show following officers. There are even cries to cancel “Paw Patrol”, one of the most popular kids cartoons of our day, a show about six pups including Chase, a German Shepherd police dog. The show’s intent, according to Nickelodeon, is to promote safety, heroism, and show children what it’s like to work together with a team. However, critics expressed concern about the positive image of law enforcement projected by the kids animated series.

Networks and production companies have become hyper-aware of their portrayal of law enforcement since the BLM riots. Media reinforcing positive perceptions of law enforcement are now seen as dangerous by the woke leftist mob’s narrative of systemic racism, particularly regarding criminal justice.

The movement to defund and even abolish police departments has gone from a radical, fringe idea to a culturally acceptable, if not mainstream idea in progressive cities and in the Democratic party.

How Memphis Kept Protests Peaceful While Other Cities Burned,"In this tense summer of racial unrest, cities around the country have erupted in violence. The damage estimate for Minneapolis’ riots is more than $500 million for the first weekend alone. Portland is heading into its eighth week of destructive riots. Even Christopher Columbus could not escape the anger of the mob as they toppled his statue into Baltimore’s inner harbor.

One large American city has maintained peaceful protests night after night: Memphis, Tennessee. Given that Memphis is routinely listed among the country’s most dangerous cities, it is hardly a place one would expect to escape the scourge of violence. More than 50 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by an assassin there on a gentle evening in April, and the city still bears the scars. Although some problems remain yet unsolved, Memphis has clawed its way back from the precipice, blazing a path for other cities.

One crisis in particular, the 2016 bridge incident, illustrates the Memphis approach. Memphis police had shot and killed a local man when he pulled a gun on an officer. In response, more than 2,000 people flooded the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, cutting off access to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital and blocking the interstate.

Police Director Michael Rallings walked out onto the bridge in his Sunday church clothes to talk with protesters. Four hours later, police and protesters walked two miles off the bridge together with an agreement to meet the following day at City Hall.

This ability to diffuse a potentially explosive situation did not come out of nowhere. The key to Memphis’ peaceful protests lies in an intricate web of relationships forged over time between churches and police, business leaders and community activists. These intentional efforts have made Memphis a model for how a torn city can come together again.

A Police Force Engaged with the Community

For the past 30 years, the Memphis police have worked hard to build relationships that foster trust in the community. Matching the racial demographics of the police force to the racial demographics of the city has been a major goal.

Memphis is 60 percent black, so police have worked hard to recruit and train black officers. Most have grown up in Memphis or surrounding areas. They know the community and its history. The police force is now more than 55 percent black.

Years ago, the Memphis police began to sponsor summer camps staffed and run by police officers. James Kirkwood, who now heads a Memphis pastors’ network, spent 31 years on the Memphis police force. He claims he can hardly go to the mall without some grown man calling out to him. “Hey, Kirkwood, you don’t remember me, do you?” It’s one of his old campers whose name, indeed, he can’t quite place. A handful of those former campers now serve on the city police force.

Summer camp is only one of the ways Memphis police have sought to forge community relationships. They created backyard neighborhood watch groups that listen for problems and search out practical solutions. Midnight basketball games bring together police and youth in the community.

One particular effort has brought tangible returns over time. Memphis police created “academies” that invite clergy and citizens to learn what police do and how they work. They demonstrate how fast someone can pull a knife on them — or a police officer. When police are dispatched to a violent scene, they do “ride alongs,” meaning a clergy member accompanies the officer.

As Kirkwood explains, “We work hard to make sure people understand that the police are not just about crime. They are here to serve the community.” Police are called to intervene in domestic violence, or take someone in kidney failure to dialysis, or talk a suicidal person into giving life another try. Even now, as almost a 1,000 cars a night bring food to the Memphis Food Bank during the pandemic, it’s the Memphis police who direct traffic.

Memphis’ Localized Dialogue

One unique aspect of Memphis’ ability to maintain peaceful protests is its history of hands-on, common-sense approaches to neighborhood needs.

Years ago, the Memphis mayor’s office created a partnership that brought together neighborhood residents, business leaders, and city officials. Folks meet at the Piccadilly Cafeteria and get stuff done. Where are the abandoned buildings? The piles of trash left untended? The house where drugs are sold? These are precursors to crime and neighborhood blight.

As one city official explains, these practical things must be tended to or people lose their sense of safety and peace of mind. When neighborhoods decline, crime and drugs take over.

As tensions rose following the tragic death of George Floyd, church and civic leaders realized that harder, more painful conversations needed to take place. They committed themselves to listen and ask only clarifying questions. Two meetings were held with area residents and community activists. No media were allowed.

At one of the meetings, George Robertson, the pastor of Second Presbyterian Church downtown, voiced the sentiments of many when he said, “I want to apologize for what the people of my race continue to do to the people of your race.” “I appreciate what you are saying, George,” one activist responded. “But if you really mean that, let’s do something about it.”

A new effort called “Opportunity Youth” is slowly evolving from those meetings. Economic inequality has been a point of ongoing pain in Memphis. An estimated 40,000 people ages 18 to 24 live below the poverty line. They have few meaningful skills that would allow them to hold a job.

Business, church, and civic leaders have committed themselves to create on-ramps for younger people who have been left behind. Their goal is to provide more apprenticeships that allow people to learn on the job. They recognize the need for coaching and accountability, for a social network that provides young people with support and role models — and in some cases, surrogate families.

As the country suffers through a summer pandemic, untangles the meaning of racism, and digs out from death and destruction, Memphis is a city to watch and emulate.

Kirkwood says the lines from an old hymn he learned as boy often filter through his head in this dismal season: “Lord, shine the light from heaven on my soul. If you find anything that shouldn’t be, take it out and straighten me. I want to be right. I want to be whole. I want to be saved.”

Perhaps the city of Memphis could share a bit of its salvation with the rest of us.

Fatalities And Injuries Climb As Riots Around The Nation Grow More Violent,"Another fatal weekend struck the United States as protests and riots around the country grow increasingly violent. Big cities such as Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Austin, and Portland all suffered from a weekend filled with chaos.

In Chicago, over 54 people were shot in the last three days with at least 2 recorded deaths. Record violence has plagued the city since protests surrounding George Floyd’s death and calls for defunding the police began in early June.

In Seattle, rioters grew rowdier and began attacking buildings on Saturday. According to the Seattle Police Department, rioters set multiple buildings on fire and broke windows at the King County Youth Service Center/Judge Patricia H. Clark Children and Family Justice Center campus. They also attacked local businesses including a Starbucks attached to an apartment complex and the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct. There was at least one major explosion that caused damage to the precinct building.

In Aurora, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, authorities are investigating a shooting that injured two after a Jeep drove through a crowd of protestors. There were no injuries from the Jeep, which the driver claims he drove through the area because “he was scared and trying to get away” from attacks on his vehicle by rioters, but shots were still fired from the crowd. According to the Aurora Police Department, police are still investigating the shooting and the Jeep incident.

In Austin, a similar incident unraveled when a group of protestors surrounded a car at a protest Saturday night. This time, however, the driver was the one who fatally shot protestor Garret Foster. At the time, Foster was wielding an AK-47 rifle.

“Austin’s police chief, Brian Manley, told reporters on Sunday that as the motorist turned, a crowd of protesters surrounded the vehicle, and some struck the car,” said the New York Times. “Minutes after the shooting, the driver called 911 and said he had been involved in a shooting and had driven away from the scene, Chief Manley said. The caller told dispatchers he had shot someone who had approached the driver’s window and pointed a rifle at him.”

In an interview earlier in the evening, Foster explained that he brought his gun to exercise his open carry and 2nd Amendment rights.

“They don’t let us march in the streets anymore, so I got to practice some of our rights,” Foster said. “If I use it against the cops, I’m dead.”

In Portland, gunfire, arson, stabbings, and other violence followed rioters as they made their way across the city. By Sunday, rioters had breached and surrounded the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse causing the incident to be declared an official riot. According to the Associated Press, federal agents used tear gas, flash bangs and pepper balls to ward off rioters early into Monday morning. As of Sunday, Portland police had arrested at least 26 people and alerted the public that they found molotov cocktails as well as loaded rifle magazines.

Federal agents established a controversial presence in the area to help protect and defend federal buildings as well as quell violence that many have said local and state officials have failed to do. President Trump criticized Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s handling of the situation on Thursday.

“He made a fool out of himself,” Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News. “He wanted to be among the people so he went into the crowd and they knocked the hell out of him. That was the end of him.”

Oregon’s U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams called for the “violent extremists” to cease their rioting and reinforced the idea of a federal presence in the area on Saturday.

“Until that happens, we’re going to do what we need to do to protect federal property,” Williams said. “When the violence ends, then there won’t be a need for the presence of nightly federal officers… It seems quite simple.”

While the Department of Homeland security and other agencies have acknowledged the presence of Antifa at the riots and are possibly instigating them, some Democrats are not taking the attacks as seriously. Representative and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler told one journalist that he thinks Antifa hosting the Portland riots is a “myth.”

“That’s a myth that’s being spread only in Washington, D.C.,” Nadler said.

Despite Chairman Nadler’s claims, the federal government is treating the riots in Portland as very real. In a statement released on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security called the rioters “violent anarchists” and said many officers have been injured because of the rioters’ “assaults.”

“The violent situation Portland has witnessed for the past eight weeks continues with violent anarchists rioting on the streets as federal law enforcement officers work diligently and honorably to enforce federal law, defend federal property, and protect the lives of their fellow officers,” DHS said. “As federal officers left the courthouse to respond to attacks on the fence, just like on previous nights they were met by rioters with hard projectiles, mortar style fireworks and lasers that can cause permanent blindness. Over the previous 24 hours, such assaults have resulted in at least 14 federal officers injured.”

In addition to the violence stemming from protests and riots, two black Trump supporters were attacked this weekend in two different cities.

In Portland, an Antifa member and convicted pedophile stabbed a black Trump supporter who goes by the name “Black Rebel.” According to The Post Millennial, Black Rebel claims Antifa members released his identity to an online community warning each other about him.

When he noticed a group of people following him and his friends around Portland, Black Rebel finally confronted them, asking why they were targeting him. That’s when David Hampe stabbed him.

Black Rebel updated followers of his condition via his social media and Periscope live-streams. Others also posted about the stabbing as well as the response from the rioters.

Police are investigating another shooting which claimed the life of Bernell Trammell, a “fixture” who ran a political and religious journal called eXpressions in Milwaukee. He was also well-known in the community for holding up signs expressing his religious and political beliefs including his support for President Trump.

Because of Trammell’s outspoken nature, many are skeptical of his death that occurred in broad daylight and are publicly wondering if there is any connection to his political beliefs.

Bernell Trammell was known to many in Milwaukee. My condolences to his family and friends. I hope they get answers and justice soon. https://t.co/XciQwmlMuJ — Senator Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson) July 25, 2020

"Corporate Media Is Ignoring Riots, But Americans Hurt By Them Aren't","We are now approaching the two-month mark since the riots that erupted across the United States in late May and early June. There is a reasonable argument to be made that these riots were unprecedented in U.S. history — or at the very least, since the 1960s. Yet if one surveyed the national media today, you’d barely even know anything happened. Nor would you likely be aware that those who bore the brunt of the destruction — largely minorities whose sensibilities don’t fit into any neatly-delineated ideological category — are still acutely suffering from the fallout.

Yes, civil unrest has of course occurred before. But the riots of 2020 exhibited features which belie any easy historical parallel. For one thing, consider their enormous geographic scope.

While the most extreme riots in cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and particularly Minneapolis did receive considerable attention — however fleeting, incomplete, and unnecessarily inflected with knee-jerk partisanship — there were also smaller-scale riots in surprisingly far-flung places that you hardly would’ve known about unless you lived in the area, happened to visit, or intentionally sought out what remains of the bare-bones local media coverage.

To take just a small sampling: Atlantic City, NJ, Fort Wayne, IN, Green Bay, WI, and Olympia, WA all underwent significant riots, at least per the normal expectations of life in these relatively low-key cities. Did you hear anything about them? Because I hadn’t, and I’m abnormally attuned to daily media coverage. Only because I personally visited did I learn of the damage.

These riots exploded with such intensity, across so many jurisdictions, and within such a contained period of time — roughly speaking, a one-week stretch beginning May 28, the day the chaos in Minneapolis/St. Paul reached a grisly apex — that no other instance of past civil unrest seems quite analogous. Complicating matters is that the riots occurred in tandem with a protest movement now believed to be the largest ever in U.S. history — one which saw demonstrations, vigils, and general rancor extend even into the most unassuming expanses of suburban and rural America.

This Is a Lot Bigger than the Media Is Letting On

On some level, you can understand why the ramifications of all this are still yet to be fully processed. The sheer volume of information is overwhelming, for one thing. And coupled with a worsening pandemic, along with the daily antics of Donald Trump, sustaining national attention on any given topic might be impossible.

But it’s also clear that the severe ramifications of these riots have been widely ignored — if not consciously obfuscated — by a media class that was near-unanimous in its approval of the accompanying protest movement. That they could have so quickly “moved on,” particularly from the wreckage of Minneapolis/St. Paul — where residents commonly told me that their lives are still in “agony” — is galling.

It doesn’t take some kind of profound journalistic acuity to walk around riot-affected areas, talk to citizens, record their stories and impressions, take some photos and record some video, and compose some tweets. And yet, I heard from hundreds of people across the United States and world who were shocked that they’d have never been aware of what happened in Minneapolis/St. Paul if not for my dinky little Twitter thread.

When I visited a month after the peak of the riots, much of this major American metropolis still lay in ruins. Not that normal life hadn’t mostly resumed; it had. But it’s resumed in the way that war-torn areas configure some ad hoc routine that enables the resumption of semi-normal activity amidst the rubble and despair.

Nobody Amplifying These Underrepresented Voices

In speaking with locals, many of whom have lost their livelihoods or had to plead for their children not to be burned alive, it often seems like the extent of the ruination they’ve experienced was barely ever appreciated in the first place. There are several potential explanations for why.

The media, in its characteristic insularity and myopia, has instead chosen to pathologically fixate on a constant stream of Culture War inanities that stem loosely from this ongoing “movement” — such as the propriety of various statues and monuments, whether various food brands and sports teams are racist, and whether various micro-celebrities need to be “canceled” for some imagined transgression. They are also beset by the various hyper-moralizing staff revolts within their own elite institutions, leading them to adopt an inordinately “inward” editorial disposition on account of their own neurotic personnel issues. Under these narcissistic conditions, real-world human suffering becomes less of a pressing concern. Journalists, editors, and pundits believe — either consciously or subconsciously, probably some half-scandalous combination of the two — that highlighting the harmful after-effects of these historic nationwide riots would somehow redound to the political benefit of Trump, which to them would be the most disastrous outcome of all. This probably isn’t even correct — Trump is currently seizing every opportunity to shoot himself in the foot all on his own — but the media class is nonetheless mortified to even contemplate the possibility that anything they might do could conceivably “help” him. These same media class members are themselves deeply invested in what they regard as “the movement,” however diffuse and ill-defined this “movement” may be, and they are extremely reluctant to produce any coverage which might reflect poorly on said “movement” and potentially undermine its moral and political legitimacy.

I don’t claim to have a complete answer for what explains this dynamic. But what I can do is simply share some of my observations and encounters. Then you can decide for yourself whether there’s been a conspicuous paucity of coverage — and if, say, a “national conversation” is warranted.

Let’s Look at America Outside the News

Numerous establishments were boarded up in Atlantic City, NJ in June. Just off the boardwalk, an Arab grocery store owner told me about how his storefront window was smashed by a rioter wielding a baseball bat as he was working. The riots came just as much of the city was preparing to partially re-open from COVID for the summer beach season.

Fort Wayne, IN doesn’t immediately come to mind as a likely candidate for a riot location, but one nonetheless took place. A coffee shop employee told me that their window was smashed by white kids with skateboards. As in many other places, the resulting plywood has served as a canvas for a city-sanctioned communal art project.

Similarly in Green Bay, WI, residents could not recall anything even approaching a riot ever occurring before. Here, the manager of a small tobacco and convenience shop displays photos of the damage taken for insurance purposes. Nearby, the windows of a Post Office were smashed.

A music shop owner in Olympia, WA told me that while his window was smashed, he also felt moved to put up the plywood boards “in solidarity” with the “movement,” to again provide protesters with a canvas for their art projects.

So many of the people I’ve encountered across the country were perfectly happy to talk about their experiences in the last two months, although many did not want to go on-record for understandable reasons. Still, there would be plenty of fodder here for heartfelt retrospective specials on CNN or in the New York Times magazine about the impact of these historic riots — and yet no such coverage has been forthcoming. It’s quite a puzzle.

“You think you’re getting justice, but you’re just tearing up your own community,” a black woman in her 40s who runs a bakery in a predominantly black part of Milwaukee — in which significant, but conspicuously undercovered riots took place — told me. She added that she would be livid if she found out that her daughter in her early 20s ever participated in such activities, and was generally condemnatory of those responsible for causing the chaos. (Many people online have made it clear that they don’t believe me, but I swear I have not “cherry-picked” any of these interviewees.)

Of the dozens and dozens of randomly-selected black Americans that I have so far spoken to across the United States, only two expressed what one might call a “positive” view of the riots, and they were both young men. Everyone else I have encountered is unabashedly scornful of rioting, and many even express apprehensions about the basic logic of a movement referred to as “Black Lives Matter” which incongruously appears to them to have caused increased suffering in their predominantly black neighborhoods.

Here’s an interview I conducted on video with a black man, Tony in Milwaukee, who describes what it was like to escape from a riotous mob on his way home from work. “It’s crazy man. I really don’t understand it. Cuz they sayin’ Black Lives Matter and all this stuff,” he said. “But man, you’re hurting the black community.”

He, like many others in various places where riots occurred, also expressed confusion about why the wrongful police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis should have necessitated random destruction in their own city — hundreds of miles away — with its own set of localized concerns that don’t necessarily have anything in common with Minneapolis. Here’s a black resident articulating the same sentiment in Philadelphia, and another in The Bronx, both places which underwent major rioting.)

Seldom acknowledged is that a large segment of black residents in urban areas over a certain age — and particularly recent immigrants from the Caribbean and Africa — are more-or-less small “c” conservative in their social and political attitudes. In general, they are far more outwardly repulsed by riots that ravaged their neighborhoods than the activist media liberals and leftists who so eagerly imbued these riots with some kind of coherent, obviously virtuous political meaning — a meaning that was evidently not apparent to many of the people who actually live in the affected areas.

It should be noted that this “small c” conservative reaction by local minority populations doesn’t in any way mean that they would be motivated to support the Republican Party or Donald Trump — as Trump is also widely seen as an agent of chaos in his own right, who exacerbates Culture War animosities rather than alleviates them.

But their baseline aversion toward Trump doesn’t negate that their sentiments diverge extremely sharply from self-appointed left/liberal journalists and activists who often claim to speak on their behalf. (For example, they were almost uniformly supportive of the deployment of National Guard to quell the chaos — unlike journalists and activists, who tend to portray the deployment of military forces to urban areas as an unambiguous sign of fascist terror.)

In Chicago, as with many other cities, small businesses now display signs declaring themselves “Black-owned” or “minority owned” — partially as an expression of pride, but mostly to dissuade further rioting:

Residents of Chicago’s predominantly black South and West sides remarked that the looting appeared to begin at apparel stores like Foot Locker, and then branched out from there. Here’s how one man described the progression.

Opportunistic “looting” should generally be distinguished from the more ideologically-motivated “rioting,” as those who “looted” were generally locals (mostly but not exclusively blacks) who simply took advantage of an unprecedentedly chaotic situation to seize goods. Whereas “riots” motivated by consciously insurrectionist ideology — consisting of arson attacks and other actions intended to maximize chaos — appear to have been largely instigated by left-wing activist whites. You could possibly group both activities under the banner of “rioting,” but it’s worth drawing a distinction between these two different kinds of conduct which arise in a riot context.

Such was the enormity of the scale of the riots all manner of drastic local measures were enacted to preempt or curtail the chaos, many of which received next-to-no attention from national media on account of their preoccupation with other things. In Hammond, IN, which sits on the state border with Illinois, the Democratic mayor went so far as to order large concrete blocks erected in the middle of a public roadway to block off unwanted incoming rioter traffic.

During a recent stop there, I heard locals muse with half-formed rumors about business owners having taken matters into their own hands and heading to the rooftops of their buildings — with rifles in tow — to fend off potential looters. Often, such rumors cannot be verified, and the rumors themselves serve a kind of psychologically-gratifying purpose for those who spread them, as they allow bystanders to construct their own self-affirming narratives out of the chaos.

But everywhere I have gone over the past two months, if there was a hint of unwieldy protest or riot activity, places are awash with rumors. This, along with the pandemic, is clearly the preeminent political issue of Summer 2020 — as opposed to the presidential campaign, which is almost like an afterthought. Joe Biden? Meh. (Although this dynamic seems to be working pretty well for Biden.)

Maybe the media commentators who reflexively glamorized these riots don’t know or don’t care, but the primary victims — meaning those who feared for their safety, suffered severe material losses, and whose lives were upended — are themselves minorities, and were targeted by activist whites.

A deli operated by a Somali man in Minneapolis remained fully boarded up with bullet holes still visible in the partially shattered windows — caused by shots fired from an armed private security force that was summoned to protect businesses during the peak of the riots. (Residents recall with astonishment that Minneapolis Police were essentially nowhere to be found as the destruction unfolded.)

According to this man, who like many others did not want to be formally interviewed, the majority of those who wreaked havoc on his establishment were white. Note that scrawled onto the plywood boarding up the Somali man’s shop is the classic anarchist “A” symbol, popular among white left-wing activists.

Needless to say, with virtually his entire neighborhood boarded up, the street in tatters, and the front entrance to his deli shuttered — one has to go through a semi-hidden backdoor in order to gain entry — business is substantially down.

One of the Somali grocer’s neighbors is a Mexican convenience store owner. He said looters broke in and stole a significant amount of items. Here are the safety precautions he took:

Elsewhere in Minneapolis, a Lao-American community center, having already drastically reduced its operations due to COVID, is boarded up and closed off with yellow police tape:

Minneapolis/St. Paul has a large population of Hmong people. Several suffered inordinately due to the riots. In a recent Wall Street Journal column, I relayed my interactions with a man named Long Her, who’s operated a clothing store in St. Paul for nearly 30 years. In that time, he told me proudly, he never once had to call the police. That changed in late May after the George Floyd killing, when much of his prized inventory was ransacked. (Although the police have been no help.)

At the time we spoke, he didn’t know what insurance would cover. He was also advised by a repair company not to get his exterior door replaced yet, because there could be additional riots throughout the summer. Many small business owners in the area reported a major delay in their orders to get windows fixed, due to a massive backlog. (Mr. Her said his security footage revealed the intruders to be a white woman and a black man.) Here’s his tabulated losses, which he said are a low-ball estimate because they don’t include potential profits from the sale of various clothing items:

Across the street from that Lao community center is a pizza shop at which the majority of the workers are Hispanics. One worker said they’d been told by an ad-hoc activist group to proclaim themselves “black owned” (the owner is, in fact, black) so that people don’t get the wrong impression when they see mostly Hispanics working there.

The shell of what was once an auto repair shop operated by an Ethiopian immigrant still sits burned out and destroyed, leaving the man out of work potentially for months, he said. The man, who like many others did not want to conduct a formal interview, remarked that he now has nothing to do all day. His tools and equipment were also destroyed.

A small Mexican restaurant near the epicenter of the riots in Minneapolis had been forced to close for the first time in 25 years, a worker said — they hadn’t even closed for COVID. When I visited, they’d only recently re-opened — but business was steeply down, as far fewer potential customers are willing to enter the area, which is still strewn with rubble and debris.

The area surrounding the restaurant:

An open question is who initiated the arson attacks in Minneapolis. According to multiple accounts relayed to me, those who instigated these most extreme acts of destruction appeared to be white left-wing activists who were not from the area. This then consumed municipal resources and created a vacuum that enabled a portion of the local, largely black and minority populations to engage in opportunistic looting — hence the distinction I mentioned earlier.

Here’s an account from a young man, Matthew, who took part in the riot at the Third Police Precinct building, which was the Ground Zero for rioting in Minneapolis. Among other observations, he remarks that those who carried out the arson attacks were exclusively white — at least according to his own first-hand observations — and at certain points, says he witnessed non-white business owners warding off white rioters.

Here’s an anarchist “A” scrawled on the burned-out shell of a liquor store across the street from the Police Precinct building. (Taken from a video “tour” I conducted of the Lake Street area.)

The liquor store viewed from the front:

Flora Westbrooks, who I also interviewed for the Wall Street Journal, told me she was convinced that those who burned down the hair salon she’d operated since 1986 couldn’t possibly have been locals because of her reputation in the community.

The former site of Ms. Westbrooks’ salon, which was connected to an Arab-owned cafe.

This structure was formerly an Indian restaurant, among other things.

Does the ubiquity of these types of signs, in which owners declare their ethnic or racial status, seem healthy to you?

A low-income housing project that had been under construction, now effectively destroyed:

One of the early promoters of the former “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone” (CHAZ) in Seattle had triumphantly used an image of the building set ablaze in the person’s Twitter bio:

(I would encourage you to view my full Twitter thread from Minneapolis if you haven’t seen it.)

One of the few booming industries in Minneapolis appears to be heavy-duty disaster-relief workers and construction contractors sifting through wreckage. (See my video tour of Lake Street area for footage of this.) While many of the establishments owned by large corporate chains have begun the recovery process, smaller establishments have not.

(In that video, a local resident, Rick, recalls being told during the riots that there would be no fire or police service available and people needed to fend for themselves. Because the winds were high on the night of the extreme arson attacks, flaming insulation was landing on residential houses, and so he had to fill up barrels of water just in case.)

The status of laundry services in North Minneapolis:

The George Floyd death site was blocked off to traffic and turned into a public memorial zone as of the time of my visit. Police generally do not enter this area, activists say, as it has been declared a “holy ground.” The day I visited, people had traveled there from as far as Florida and Texas.

Prayer circle that I took part in at the George Floyd death site:

Various places in St. Paul:

A school:

I’ll close with this. (Believe me, there’s plenty more. The amount of information and photos is overwhelming.) The owner of a convenience store in North Minneapolis told me he had to take up arms during the peak of the riots to protect his establishment. Here’s the exterior of the store:

The man, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, said the following: “I grew up in a war zone, and I’ve never seen anything like it.” What does it say that these kinds of experiences have barely impinged on the national consciousness?

Despite the incredible amount of destruction that I’ve personally witnessed, it’s only a tiny fraction. If I hadn’t made a point to spend six weeks traveling around the country, I never would’ve gotten this information.

Is a “national conversation” warranted here? I don’t know. That’s a ridiculous cliche, anyway. But I do know the enormity of what transpired over these past two months has not been adequately conveyed.

Leaked Bodycam Footage Of George Floyd's Arrest Provides New Context,"New bodycam footage of George Floyd’s arrest leaked to the Daily Mail provides new context to his apprehension by Minneapolis police which ultimately ended in Floyd’s death when officers struggled to get ahold of Floyd resisting arrest, sparking the worst outbreak of civil unrest in decades.

According to the Daily Mail, the bodycams where the footage came from were worn by Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng and were filed in court on July 7 by Lane’s attorney in a motion to dismiss charges against the former Minneapolis policeman. While made available for a limited court viewing on July 15, the videos were prohibited from being published by the media. The Daily Mail did not report who leaked the footage.

The videos show Floyd in the driver seat of a car approached by two officers after the 46-year-old allegedly passed off a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The episode later escalated as officers directed Floyd out of the vehicle and over to a police cruiser where Floyd is seen refusing to comply with police requests to get in the SUV. Two other officers came to assist Lane and Kueng, including Officer Derek Chauvin who, after a brief struggle ended up with a knee on Floyd’s neck. Floyd died after several minutes while uttering the words, “I can’t breathe,” the modern mantra of the Black Lives Matter movement that stemmed from the death of Eric Gardner’s last words in New York.

All four officers involved were shortly fired after the incident and face criminal charges.

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner later determined that Floyd had trace amounts of fentanyl and methamphetamines in his system at the time of the arrest.

Nationwide protests erupted in the aftermath of Floyd’s death that culminated in weeks of violent rioting tearing apart minority communities across the country. Some parts of the country, such as Portland, have seen continued protests throughout the rest of the summer as the nation grapples with a new cultural revolution. The rioting quickly became about far more than Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/04/leaked-bodycam-footage-of-george-floyds-arrest-provides-new-context-to-police-apprehension/,2020-08-04
"Report: Lack Of Churches, Schools, Police Fueling Murders In Major Cities","A new report from the Wall Street Journal confirms a wave of violent crime has swept major cities across the country, and is linked to closed churches, closed schools, and pilloried police departments.

The investigation, which was released Sunday, used crime data from police departments across the 50 largest U.S. cities. It found that nearly all are undergoing a severe rise in homicides. Thirty-six out of 50 of the cities are seeing double-digit increases in killings, for a nationwide toll of nearly 4,000 additional lives lost. The victims are disproportionately black and Latino.

The three largest cities, Democrat-run New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago saw rises of 24 percent, 14 percent, and more than 52 percent, respectively.

The findings are particularly striking considering killings were decreasing across major cities in April and May, suggesting the big increases are concentrated in the last two months. If the surge continues, then, the rate of growth for the year will end up being much higher across the board.

The Church, The Police, and The Schools

While the report is limited to the country’s largest cities, its authors’ work with mayors, community leaders, law enforcement, and field experts indicates a decay of the social safety net due to coronavirus shutdowns is at the root of the problem.

“Homicides, on the other hand, are up because violent criminals have been emboldened by the sidelining of police, courts, schools, churches and an array of other social institutions by the reckoning with police and the pandemic,” the report notes.

The first link, of law enforcement difficulties stemming from the ongoing anti-police protests, is backed up by prior independent work from The Federalist. The cities undergoing the worst of the violence are those where public leaders pilloried and even defunded their own law enforcement.

Greater law enforcement presence is widely recognized to discourage crime, leading to far fewer shootings and homicides. With law enforcement stretched to the breaking point due to slashed budgets, increased willingness to attack officers making arrests, and an unsurprising surge in police retirements, a rise in criminal homicides is a predictable result.

The new report suggests an additional, deeper cause of this drastic increase in murders.

“Everything that society does that might shape public safety was turned upside-down during the pandemic,” Professor Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago said to the Wall Street Journal.

Despite being labeled “nonessential” for months, tight-knit social organizations — namely, religious congregations — serve a critical role as guardians for society’s most at risk. In settings where individuals are isolated from stable family life, churches can play a stabilizing role. Their forced closures and strict limitations over the last few months have torn out this source of stability from communities at the same time millions have been forced out of work.

Then come the schools. In addition to churches, education forms a key source of stability for at-risk youth. And like churches, in-person teaching has all but disappeared from their lives. If schools remain closed this fall, it’s fully possible the situation will only grow worse.

As state governments blocked individuals from key protective social institutions, they may well have opened a tinderbox the anti-police movement lit. It would explain why the opening months of the pandemic remained relatively free of violence, only to explode with a trigger.

As the surge in shootings and killings keeps trending upwards, much more research must be done before any absolute conclusions can be made. Identifying the role churches and schools play in preventing the level of violence we’re seeing needs to be a top priority for researchers for long-term answers.

In the meanwhile, the public can pressure politicians, local and national, to restore the social fabric that has helped prevent situations like this for centuries.

New Poll Shows Majority Of Black Americans Favor Higher Police Presence,"A Gallup poll released on Wednesday shows that 81 percent of black Americans want the police presence to remain the same or increase in their neighborhood or area. According to the poll, “67 percent of all U.S. adults” also prefer the “status quo” when it comes to local police presence.

“Most Black Americans want the police to spend at least as much time in their area as they currently do, indicating that they value the need for the service that police provide,” the poll concludes.

Eighty-three percent of Hispanic Americans and 88 percent of white Americans share similar attitudes. In contrast, only 72 percent of Asian Americans say they would prefer increased or the same amount of police presence in their neighborhoods.

After an examination of factors such as volume and frequency of police interactions, however, researchers determined that neither were the most significant factor in dictating black Americans’ attitudes towards police presence in their area.

While “exposure comes with more trepidation for Black than White or Hispanic Americans about what they might experience in a police encounter,” poll analysis suggests that “simply having an interaction with the police in the past year has no bearing on black Americans’ preference for local police presence in their area.”

In cases where black Americans see police in their neighborhood, there is a “limited impact” on determining increased, the same, or decreased police appearances in their area.

“The slightly elevated frequency with which Black Americans see police in their neighborhood has limited impact on their preferences for changing the local police presence,” the poll explains. “About a third of Black Americans who say they often see the police in their neighborhood think the police should spend less time there (34%); however, the majority of adults in this group think they should spend the same amount of time (56%) or more time (10%).”

The most significant factor in determining attitudes towards police presence, according to Gallup is the “quality of the interaction.”

While “fewer than one in five Black Americans feel very confident that the police in their area would treat them with courtesy and respect,” only 13 percent of black Americans who were “treated respectfully” favor decreased police presence in their area while 87 percent want the same or increased number and frequency of police.

“Those harboring the least confidence that they will be treated well, or who have had negative encounters in the past, are much more likely to want the police presence curtailed,” the poll concludes.

A previous Gallup poll released in late July showed that only 22 percent of black Americans approved of abolishing police departments, while 90 percent showed great interest in “specific reforms aimed at improving police relations with the communities they serve and preventing or punishing abusive police behavior.”

"‘F— Pigs’: Rioters Attack Portland Police Station With Rocks, Set It On Fire","Demonstrations in Portland again descended into violence as hundreds attacked the city’s East Precinct police station by night. Fire, rocks, and rams were used by rioters in attempts to break into the occupied building, and a truck that appears to have been driven by a demonstrator tried to run over several officers when police arrived to break the siege, police say. A memorial to a fallen police officer was also defaced.

The events met mostly silence from corporate media.

The night began with hundreds marching towards the precinct late Wednesday night, police say. Eyewitnesses say the rioters used vehicles to block off roads around the station, then began vandalizing the building with anti-police slogans, including “F-ck pigs” and “FTP,” which stands for “F-ck the police.” Security cameras were quickly disabled. Videos of the opening have been released by Post Millennial journalist Andy Ngo, who has been covering Portland’s riots for weeks.

For the first time since the riots began in Portland, antifa attacked the east precinct, located far on the east side of the city. Rioters immediately began disabling security cameras around the building. #PortlandRiots pic.twitter.com/s6hoPPwAs1 — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) August 6, 2020

Later videos show officers were inside the building during the attack.

Once the cameras were disabled, videos show the rioters began tearing down protective barriers surrounding the building, then hammering against the exposed glass with rocks the size of shot putts, boards, and other unidentified tools. Lasers were used to blind officers inside, and a fire was set against the building’s protective entrance after rioters failed to gain entry through physical force.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1291316396236963842

A riot was declared shortly after the attempts began.

Heavily geared police arrived to break up the attack, but met fierce resistance. Rioters lobbed “rocks the size of shot-puts,” commercial-grade fireworks, and other projectiles at the officers, whom the police say used tear gas and “crowd control munitions” in return. During the conflict, police say a truck associated with the demonstrators attempted to run over several of the officers.

Some of the rioters appeared to have been sporting Antifa symbols.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1291366814002356225

Since federal agents largely left the city, rioters have moved to targeting police officers and police buildings. Another city building used by police was attacked on Monday, while the Portland Police Association headquarters was hit and set ablaze on Wednesday morning.

Corporate media has been largely silent on the continuing riots. For weeks, media and Democrat politicians have asserted that the violence was only caused by the presence of federal agents. Some went as far as to declare themselves vindicated and insist the movement was now peaceful — while police and federal buildings were attacked and set on fire.

The attacks come in the midst of a historic homicide surge in the city. According to the police association, there have been 366 shootings so far in Portland this year, which is already about the amount the city suffered in all of 2019.

https://www.facebook.com/PortlandPoliceAssociation/posts/3549031871787171

The association attributes the sudden spike to Mayor Ted Wheeler’s decision to “defund” the police. Spending on law enforcement was slashed, and the city’s gun violence reduction team was disbanded.

"Gallup: 81 Percent Of Black Americans Want Police, Some Want More","A new Gallup poll released Wednesday shows an overwhelming majority of black Americans, 81 percent, support either the same amount or an increased police presence in their communities.

The survey, conducted June 23 – July 6, showed 61 percent of black Americans supported police spending the same about of time in their neighborhoods while 20 percent wanted law enforcement to spend more time in their streets. Nineteen percent said police should spend less time in their community.

In contrast, 24 percent of Hispanic Americans wanted more policing compared to 17 percent of white Americans and 9 percent of Asian Americans, who were also most likely to report supporting a decrease in police presence in their neighborhoods at 28 percent.

Black Americans reported the highest levels of seeing officers in their neighborhoods: 32 percent said they saw police either often or very often. Twenty-eight percent of Hispanic Americans said the same compared to 22 percent of white Americans and 21 percent of Asian Americans.

The survey was conducted in English online, taking answers from 36,463 adults aged 18 and older with a +/-1.4 percent margin of error. The poll comes from Gallup’s new Center on Black Voices. Gallup reported that the findings remain consistent with a previous poll showing only 22 percent of black Americans supporting calls to abolish police departments.

Despite contradicting the views of the vast majority of black Americans, demands for defunding police have become a signature of the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. Fifty-eight percent of Americans said do agree that policing needs “major changes.”

In June, the Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to disband its police department tasked with protecting more than 400,000 residents.

The latest Gallup poll comes amid a crime wave sweeping the nation’s cities as animosity towards police reaches new heights from a vocal minority, demoralizing law enforcement and stripping resources dedicated to ensuring public safety. The cities of Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Nashville, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and New Orleans have reach seen homicides jump more than 20 percent just this year.

Biden's Capitulation To The Crazy Left Is Alienating Democrats Like Me,"Last year, Joe Biden’s path to the presidency seemed clear: Treat President Donald Trump as a historical anomaly whom Biden would replace, then restore American values, overcome petty politics, and get government working again. This message was designed to appeal both to Democrats, like me, and to Republican and Independent voters tired of the toxic political environment we’ve suffered since 2016.

That strategy initially worked well. Despite constant attacks from opponents and the press, by March 17, Biden had effectively wrapped up the nomination, and polls showed him trouncing Trump in key states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.

In recent weeks, however, Biden’s messaging has changed. Now it is pushing millions of voters toward Trump just as regular Americans start paying closer attention to the race. Most Beltway Democrats don’t recognize this, of course. They see polls showing Biden with a large lead over Trump and believe the former vice president is headed for a blowout win.

They might be right, but the winds seem to be changing. Polls that failed to predict the outcome of the 2016 presidential contest seem just as likely to fail now, with 62 percent of Americans afraid to say what they believe because of our toxic political environment. The more Biden caves to the left, the harder it becomes for him to win middle-class voters, especially those in the upper Midwest who typically decide presidential elections.

The Hard Left Controls Biden Now

Nowhere is this more apparent than in Biden’s new alliance with democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden deserves credit for trying to bring Sanders’ supporters into the fold, something Hillary Clinton never really did. The 110-page “unity plan” Biden’s campaign developed with Sanders supporters such as Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez tries hard to make both the far-left and moderates happy.

Like most such efforts, however, it fails. It throws trillions of dollars at problems without explaining how to pay for them or taking into account the debt-fueled trillions Congress is spending to deal with the coronavirus. It envisions a bloated bureaucracy that would shift even more power away from states and local governments and into Washington, D.C.

That is not a popular idea in America, and it won’t appeal to middle-class voters who have watched their government bungle the pandemic response, unnecessarily driving the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with no end in sight. While the Democratic Party worries about the details of the unity plan, the rest of America is focused on simpler things, such as getting kids back to school — real school, not the fake virtual learning kids had to participate in during the spring — and getting people back to work. On those issues, Biden’s plans miss the mark.

Biden’s Plans Are Empty Swamp-Speak

Take the former vice president’s proposal to reopen schools this fall. It consumes five pages, discussing things that have nothing to do with schools or children.

It contains bureaucratic gobbledygook such as creating a “White House-led initiative to identify evidence-based policy solutions that address gaps in learning, mental health, social and emotional well-being, and systemic racial and socioeconomic disparities in education that the pandemic has exacerbated” plus developing “a COVID-19 Educational Equity Gap Challenge Grant to encourage states and tribal governments … to develop bold plans that adopt evidence-based policy recommendations and give all of our students the support they need to succeed.”

American voters aren’t stupid. They see a five-point, five-page “roadmap” to reopening schools, and they know what it means: Schools won’t reopen any time soon. They won’t tolerate that.

Biden’s plan to reopen the American economy has similar failings. Biden would also “Build a National Contact Tracing Workforce,” which he says is “a core component of a robust nationwide data-driven disease surveillance system.”

Seriously? A nationwide surveillance system might sound good to people in D.C. — who, of course, would run this new bureaucracy — but it sounds downright Orwellian to the rest of us, for a virus that more than 99 percent of people survive. Voters across America have already seen their civil liberties trampled this year. They will not welcome further intrusions.

Biden Betrays Law Enforcement

Although Biden takes a law-and-order approach to coronavirus, he has thrown actual law enforcement officers under the bus by kowtowing to activists who want to “defund the police.” As Biden knows, defunding the police is a myth. Its proponents openly admit they want to abolish police departments, not only defund them.

Meanwhile, in the real world, crime is skyrocketing. Eliminating the police will not help the residents of Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, and Portland. Neither will conditioning federal aid on whether police departments “meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community,” the position Biden took to avoid saying he wants the police defunded.

Imagine telling that to a gang unit or to undercover officers. Biden can keep trying to toe the line, but when regular Americans hear him say he will condition federal aid on cops being “decent,” they reasonably interpret that to mean he will bow to the mob and not stand up for law enforcement. This is why the National Association of Police Organizations endorsed Trump this year, despite endorsing the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012 specifically because it included Biden.

“For Joe Biden, police are shaking their heads because he used to be a stand-up guy who backed law enforcement,” said the association’s executive director Bill Johnson. Sadly, this plays right into Trump’s hand. Trump might not know much, but he has stellar political instincts. Unlike Democrats, he’s delivering a clear message that will appeal to the majority of Americans: Send kids back to school, support police officers, and get people back to work now.

Trump Is Using Reagan’s Playbook

In this vein, Trump is following in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan, just as he did in 2016. Democrats underestimated Reagan’s appeal during the 1980s. It wasn’t until 2006 that one prominent Democrat observed that Reagan’s skill in winning middle-class voters “spoke to the failures of liberal government, during a period of economic stagnation, to give middle-class voters any sense that it was fighting for them.”

“By promising to side with those who worked hard, obeyed the law, cared for their families, and loved their country, Reagan offered Americans a sense of a common purpose that liberals seemed no longer able to muster,” this prominent Democrat observed. “And the more his critics carped, the more those critics played into the role he’d written for them — a band of out-of-touch, tax-and-spend, blame-America-first, politically correct elites.”

That Democrat was Barack Obama, writing in his 2006 book “The Audacity of Hope.” His observations apply just as much today as they did then — and they will drive people to vote for Trump again.

It’s No Mystery Why People Prefer Trump

This is already occurring across key states. CNN’s Rich Thau has been conducting focus groups of Obama-Trump voters in the Midwest and found recently that 22 of 33 respondents preferred Trump to Biden. It’s easy to see why. According to Thau:

They think a businessman is best suited to turn the country around economically. They feel COVID-19 was not Trump’s fault, and he’s doing the best he can to contain it. They conflate the Black Lives Matter protesters with the rioters attacking federal buildings and retail shops. They don’t want historic monuments torn down. And they dismiss defunding the police as ridiculous. These voters tell me they want America finally to be put first; they oppose immigration and trade policies they say give benefits to foreigners at their expense. And they want a non-politician who relentlessly fights back, after witnessing too many officeholders fold in the face of special interests.

These voters cannot be discounted as racists or deplorables who need to be canceled. Their votes matter just as much as the protesters and rioters. They could easily lift Trump to a second term.

If that happens, Democrats will have only themselves to blame. The coronavirus gave them the chance to show what real leadership looks like. So far, they have failed.

Democrats have a small window to come to their senses, reconnect with working people, and fix it. But that will require them to get out of Washington and stand up to the special interests that are exploiting the virus for political gain — and that seems increasingly unlikely.

Chicago Erupts In Overnight Looting And Destruction After Police Shooting,"The city of Chicago experienced chaos and destruction Sunday night, with looting and property damage stretching from the Loop all the way up to the Near North Side and including Chicago’s Miracle Mile. News outlets are reporting that it appears to be an organized attack. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Superintendent, David Brown, however, stated in a press briefing Monday morning that it was not.

Video shows people running out of parked cars and breaking into stores. CBS 2’s, Ryan Baker, reports that former Bears player Patrick Mannelly watched the looting from his high-rise condo and saw cars driving up to a U-Haul truck and putting stolen goods into the trailer.

The Gold Coast is being looted right now. What the hell is going on @chicagosmayor ? 3:11am. WTF! pic.twitter.com/SF0x4q6LIb — Patrick Mannelly (@PatrickMannelly) August 10, 2020

The violence was sparked by a tense moment on Sunday afternoon in the Englewood neighborhood where a 20-year-old man shot at officers who returned fire and struck the shooter. A large crowd, responding to false rumors the young man was a child, gathered at the scene to hurl things at officers who were holding the line to protect the crime scene.

Brown said the shooter had four previous arrests with charges including burglary, child endangerment, and domestic battery.

After the shooting, Brown said, a crowd gathered on the South Side. Chicago PD became aware of several social media posts encouraging looting downtown, so some 400 officers were dispatched downtown.

“As of now, Chicago police have made more than 100 arrests for looting, disorderly conduct, battery against police, among other charges. A total of 13 officers have been injured throughout the night, including a sergeant who was struck with a bottle. Another officer had his nose broken as he fought with a group of looters,” Brown said.

Social media is replete with videos of the violence that took place Sunday night.

Brown reported that in the last seven days, a total of nine officers have been shot in Chicago. There were 31 shootings throughout the city Friday through Sunday, three of which were murders. “This was an act of violence against our police officers and against our city,” said Brown.

“I pledge to pursue these offenders to the fullest extent of the law. A heavy police presence will continue throughout the downtown area today and until further notice. Officers will return to working 12-hour shifts and all days off have been canceled until further notice.” Brown also announced that downtown access will be restricted 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot also spoke Monday morning saying, “These individuals engaged in what only could be described as brazen and extensive criminal looting and destruction. To be clear, this had nothing to do with legitimate, protected First Amendment expression.”

The Mayor pointed out, “These same stores that were hit last night were hit previously not just by looting, but closures due to COVID-19…”

To the looters, the Mayor said:

There is no justification for criminal behavior, ever. You have no right, no right, to take and destroy the property of others. Our residents deserve to be safe. Our businesses deserve to understand and enjoy safety and security of their property and in their employees. And our police officers deserve to be able to do their job without having to worry about shots being fired, projectiles being thrown, and being maced. This is not anywhere near acceptable. And I call upon our state’s attorney and our courts to make sure these individuals who are arrested and those to come are held accountable. Put your best people on this. We have made the case, we have the video, we have the officer testimony; these people need to be held accountable and not cycle through the system.

See The Brilliant Signs Seattle’s Silent Majority Made To Support Police,"Exactly two months after protestors broke into Seattle city hall demanding Mayor Jenny Durkan resign over her refusal to defund the police, the not-silent-anymore majority stood outside that same building voicing their support for Seattle Police Department (SPD).

About 5,000 supporters of SPD gathered on Sunday to oppose the Seattle City Council’s plans to defund police. That, according to stopdefunding.com, would mean “over half of all Seattle police officers [would be fired,] immensely longer 911 response times and of course, higher crime rates.” Here’s what some of them had to say.

Alex, an off-duty cop, attended the rally and was grateful that “the silent majority was speaking up.” He noted, “We hear that people support us, but today we see it.”

The self-identified “American Flag Guy from CHAZ/CHOP” showed up to support “law and order.” He is interested in police reform, not defunding. American Flag Guy ironically noted that the ideas animating the defund the police counter-protestors were the greatest source of “oppression” that he faced “as a black man in America” today.

Two men waving “Back the Blue” flags were there to “make sure the police don’t get defunded because of a radical minority.” Asked about their chief concerns, the pair noted that “when you defund the police, crime goes up” and added, pointing to the counter protestors, “They don’t understand that will hurt the minority community the most.”

Two women who work for the African American Community Advisory Council (AACAC) which emphasizes youth outreach and community engagement, attended Sunday’s rally. Victoria Deach, chair of the AACAC, has been “trying to bridge the gap between the black community and SPD and so far it’s been really good.”

But she’s concerned that the current effort to defund the police means she’s “worked her butt off for nothing.” Although she voted for some members of the city council in the last election, if they defund the police, she will do whatever she can to “get them out.”

Felicia Cross is worried the movement to defund the police will undo all the progress the SPD has made in the black community. Felicia has “watched police officers get people out of their cars and into housing” and notes that the AACAC (which is on the chopping block if the SPD is defunded) provides “200 beds for kids every year.” Felicia is scared and notes that if the city council has its way, she’s “not ever coming out of my house again.”

One cop who “got the day off just to attend this rally” created a sign spoofing the “racism is small dick energy” signs waved in his face on the job.

“I’m here because [the protesters have] been messing with me for two weeks,” he says. “I just have to stand in line and they’ve been throwing urine bottles at me, feces, rocks, bricks, they’ve been calling me racial slurs, homophobic slurs, so I figured I’d take the day off today and practice my right as well and come out here and tell them what I think.”

While he believes in affordable housing, equality, and getting people off the street, he thinks the city council “is reckless” and wishes they’d “run the city like grownups.”

One young woman who thought she “would be the only one there” was surprised to see the crowded plaza. Why did she attend? “Because black lives matter,” and that means “we need the police.”

Two Iranian immigrants held signs that read “Back the Blue” and “We love #SPD.” One sign stated “we love the police” in both Persian and Arabic. They were at the rally because “in this country we feel comfortable when the police are around,” while police presence in most other countries brings trouble. They added they support police because “we don’t want to share this city with criminals.”

Chants from the 40 to 60 counter protestors were largely drowned out by the cheerful pro-police crowd. One 14-year-old girl who “definitely wants to be a cop” when she grows up noted the contrast in the two groups: “I think it’s interesting that the other side was like flipping us off and swearing and they all seemed like they just wanted to fight. But our side was just happy and passionate and cleaning up trash.”

Another pair, who didn’t want their names shared for fear of being doxed, noted that they took time out of their Sunday to “support the police” and because they “hate Antifa.” Asked their opinion on defunding the police, the woman responded, “We would prefer to defund the city council. These people don’t deserve to have 10,000 a month when they’re reducing the number of police officers.”

Two Boy Scouts, age 17 and 15, from nearby Federal Way, held no signs but quietly worked the grounds with their Nifty Nabber litter collectors. Why were they there? To be “True to the blue, to support our police departments. And pick up trash.”

The Seattle City Council will vote tonight on whether to defund the police despite opposition from Mayor Durkan, police Chief Carmen Best, and the Seattle Police Officers’ Guild. We will see if the 5,000 peaceful but vocal citizens at Sunday’s rally made them think twice.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/10/see-the-brilliant-snarky-signs-seattles-silent-majority-made-to-support-police/,2020-08-10
"Washington Post Insists Portland Is ‘Calm,’ Just As Local Police Declare More Back-To-Back Riots","The Washington Post claimed that “chaos ended” in Portland, Oregon as soon as federal agents began to leave the city on July 30, but local police declared riots happening in the city as recently as Tuesday and Wednesday.

“The first protest held since the federal agencies agreed to pull back their officers was a markedly more peaceful affair,” the Post’s Adam Taylor wrote, adding that the crowds left earlier and largely left on their own.

“Calm returns to Portland as federal agents withdraw,” another headline claimed.

On Wednesday, local news reported that Portland police declared a riot “for the second night in a row.” Demonstrators targeted the Portland Police East Precinct, which is surrounded by residential apartments.

The Oregonian reported that some demonstrators were tearing plywood boards off of precinct windows and creating barricades in the street with dumpsters. Police also said that glass doors were cracked. A few minutes before 10 p.m., police declared the situation a riot and told the crowds that they would use tear gas if people did not leave the area. Eight people were arrested by the end of the night.

Police also declared a riot on Tuesday night after demonstrators broke into the Portland Police Association building.

Rather than update its story or issue a correction, the Post simply published another story with a similar-sounding headline that contained an important tweak. “Trump sent agents to quell unrest. But protest is what Portland does best,” the headline blared.

“More than 100 federal agents sent by President Trump to fortify the federal courthouse have retreated, turning over the task to state police. Still, the protests continue. Demonstrators say they’re not finished,” wrote the Post in an article featuring glamorizing, stylized photos of protestors.

Meanwhile, on Thursday night, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler slammed demonstrators who had instigated violence. “You are not demonstrating, you are attempting to commit murder,” he said of those who attempted to set fire to a police building.

“Don’t think for a moment that you are if you are participating in this activity, you are not being a prop for the reelection campaign of Donald Trump — because you absolutely are,” he continued. “You are creating the B-roll film that will be used in ads nationally to help Donald Trump during this campaign.”

Seattle’s First Black Female Police Chief Resigns After Budget Cuts,"Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best announced Monday evening she is retiring, the same day the city council voted to slash police department funding.

“This was a difficult decision for me, but when it’s time, it’s time,” Best said in an email to the police department. The first black woman to serve as police chief in Seattle, Best will step down on Sept. 2.

Best told local reporter Brandi Kruse that “she felt targeted by a ‘punitive’ proposal to cut her pay by 40%.”

“I do feel like it’s … animus toward me specifically,” she added.

The city council approved a plan Monday that included decreasing the size of the Seattle police department by up to 100 officers. Currently, the police force in Seattle totals about 1,400. The city council’s plan would also cut the salaries of some command staff, and break up a task force that was used to remove homeless camps.

Best and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan have expressed disapproval of the city council’s proposals. Using layoffs to decrease the force’s size, they insisted, would end up decreasing the police department’s diversity.

“We don’t want to lay off our newest recruits and our newest officers,” Durkan said. But labor rules require that “layoffs must be conducted by seniority, meaning that the youngest, most diverse officers would be the first to go.”

An email from Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County blamed the city council for Best’s resignation.

“The first Black woman to hold the position of Chief of Police of the Seattle Police Department has been forced out of her job by the Seattle City Council,” the statement said. “We demand the Seattle City Council stop prioritizing performative action that solely suggests the appearance of change.”

Mayor Jenny Durkan will give a press conference at 11 a.m. on Tuesday.

"Austin City Council Defunds Police, 911 While Upping Funds For Abortion","Austin’s all-Democrat city council voted Thursday to slash police funding by $150 million, more than a third of the department’s $434 million budget, while redirecting $100,000 of that amount to abortion access.

The decision cuts functions from the police department such as the 911 call center, community partnerships, victims’ services, and traffic enforcement, as well as cadet classes and officers’ overtime pay. Some functions, such as 911, are moved to other jurisdictions, while some are ended. Some of the cuts include, according to local outlet KVUE:

911 Call Center – $17.7 million

Forensic Sciences – $12.7 million

Support Services – $14.1 million

Community Partnerships – $2.5 million

Victims Services – $3.1 million

Internal Affairs – $4.5 million

Special Investigations – $1.8 million

Special Events – $4.4 million

Mounted Patrol – $2.1 million

Traffic Enforcement – $18.4 million

Austin Regional Intelligence Center – $2 million

Park Police – $5.8 million

Lake Patrol – $1.4 million

Organized Crime/K-9 – $1.2 million

Nuisance Abatement – $312,000

Canceling 3 Cadet Classes – $2.2 million this year

Officer Overtime – $2.8 million

License Plate Readers – $133,000

An amendment proposed by Austin Mayor Pro Tem Delia Garza directed $100,000 of the funding to increasing access to abortions, according to the “Immediate Community Investments and Reimagining Plan.” Although state law prohibits government funding for abortion, the City of Austin gets around those restrictions by funding “abortion access,” including travel, lodging, and child-care expenses for women seeking abortions.

“Austin has reaffirmed their commitment to killing preborn children with taxpayer dollars,” said Kimberlyn Schwartz of Texas Right To Life in a press release.

The decision to cut the police department’s funding by more than one-third came after City Manager Spencer Cronk was criticized for his original proposal, which would have cut the department by $11 million. Instead, the council’s final budget cut police funding by more than ten times that.

“We remain concerned about the reductions in police positions when crime is increasing and response times are slower,” the Greater Austin Crime Commission said in a statement. Violent crimes, including homicides, aggravated assaults, and arson, rose in Austin in March and April.

Melanie Rodriguez, president of the Austin Police Women’s Association, criticized the city council for still benefitting from its security detail. “If the mayor and council need special protection they can hire it themselves,” she said.

Others, like Chas Moore of the Austin Justice Coalition, lauded the decision and suggested that more changes like it would follow. “We are just getting started,” he insisted.

"Local Residents Push Back Against Violence, Looting In Their Neighborhoods","While violence ensued across American cities in recent months, many citizens are becoming exasperated with the protesting, rioting, and looting and are demanding a change when their own local leaders won’t. According to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, “50% of Likely U.S. Voters say the police should crack down on the protests to bring them to an end.”



Multiple cities over the last week have seen a pushback against violence from citizens who agree that the original protest movements may have lost their purpose.

According to The Daily Wire, residents of Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood interrupted a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday “to demand the protesters leave.”

The Chicago BLM group, joined by other activist organizations, was “holding a protest to support those arrested for looting” after over 100 people were arrested on Sunday “claiming that looting is ‘reparations’” and they were just “taking what is rightfully theirs from ‘corporations.’”

Residents of the nearby neighborhood however, quickly organized a counter-protest asking the non-resident activists to disperse.

“If your issue is with the police, take it to 35th and Michigan [where CPD headquarters is located]. Don’t come in Englewood with it,” Darryl Smith, president of the Englewood Political Task Force and Englewood resident of 51 years. “If the people on 56th Street want to come over and protest the police, they can do it. But no one from the North Side or Indiana or any place other than Englewood can come here and do that.”

“Y’all don’t come out when a kid gets shot. Y’all come out when it’s got something to do with the f****** police,” Smith added.

Another Englewood resident also expressed his frustrations “They didn’t let the community know. They didn’t put flyers on peoples’ doors,” Kidd continued. “If they would’ve gotten something incited with the police, who’s gotta deal with it tomorrow? The community. Not them. They’ll be somewhere sipping sangria somewhere. I’m telling you like it is.”

According to on the ground reporters, the protest was “canceled” by BLM about 30 minutes after it started.

“We have a relationship with the commander and if anyone wants to come in here and talk to the police about the shooting or anything, they have to go through us,” the group reportedly stated.

The local BLM organization however, disputed this claim on Twitter saying that they didn’t “cancel” the protest.

Meanwhile, in Richmond, Virginia, The Washington Post reported that residents became more than uneasy with looting and violence since the most recent outbreak of rioting over the last week.

According to one Richmond resident and her husband, attempts to ask the protesters to relocate so her family could sleep were met with cries of “no justice, no peace.”

“I have been very sympathetic to [fighting] injustice and inequality, but it seems like right now the protesting and the destruction of private property has nothing to do with any of that,” Nuckolls added.

According to the Post, “a group of about 50 protesters vandalized downtown businesses and smashed windows at the city’s John Marshall Courthouse, causing what Mayor Levar Stoney said was hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.”

“Regular citizens [feel] caught in the middle,” said Charlie Diradour, a Monument Avenue citizen. “This movement started to take the statues down and many of us — I would say a majority of us who live on Monument Avenue — were completely down with that movement, all up until they started breaking s—. And that was a bridge too far for many of us. Because what does it benefit society to have the right to have your voice heard if your next move is to break a window of the Omni Hotel, the John Marshall court building?”

According to Fox 12 in Portland, many are worried for their safety as rioting and violence permeate their neighborhood close to the Portland Police Association.

“It really feels like a war zone,” Marta, a resident told Fox.



Other residents are feeling the physical effects of the rioting as well.

“It’s scary. We’re not sure what is going to happen and just the destruction. You know, if they were marching and so on, I’d be out there marching with them,” Tina Henderson, another resident said.

While many in the neighborhood feel the desire for the violence to calm down, many aren’t sure what to do.

“Of course I want the city to do more but I don’t know what the answer is, you know if I were the mayor I don’t know what I’d be doing,” Henderson said.

"Chiefs, Detectives, And Police Unions Slam Goodyear’s Anti-Cop Policy: ‘It’s Just Disgusting’","Goodyear Tires has long been held up as the ideal for police tires, which is why many were shocked when a photo allegedly from Goodyear’s sensitivity training was posted online. The leaked photo said “Black Lives Matter” attire was permitted, but “Blue Lives Matter” would be met with zero tolerance.

While Goodyear denied that the photo came from their corporate office, they admitted that their policy bans any political paraphernalia “that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues.” The policy seems to align perfectly with the allegedly fake photo.

In regards to this ludicrous and anti-cop stance from a major provider of tires for police cars, several officers and union representatives spoke to The Federalist about their thoughts on Goodyear and the broader relationship between the public and the police.

There was a general consensus that companies ought not limit the speech of their employees by determining which opinions are “acceptable” to express. Detective Greg Wilking from Salt Lake City, Utah, said he doesn’t think the company policy helps anyone. “Being anti-someone and pro-something else and putting everyone else down in their beliefs or encouraging their speech, I don’t think it’s helpful in any direction,” he said.

Bill Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Officers (NAPA), a major police union said, “From our point of view, it’s just disgusting. It would be wrong for any employer to try to dictate their employees’ thoughts or feelings or political views, but in this case, I think they’re on the wrong side of it.”

This trend of companies distancing themselves from the police and supporting leftist causes is not exclusive to Goodyear. The list of companies releasing woke statements is seemingly endless. Lieutenant John Lamon of Sparta, New Jersey, noted Goodyear’s policy as a continuation of the national trend, stating, “It seems like a lot of these corporations now have swung the direction of, ‘we’re going to make sure that we don’t offend anyone.’ It’s something that, as with anything, we’re going to have to deal with. Sometimes you don’t like stuff that occurs, but all you can do is try to work with it.”

Dennis Slocumb, International Political Director and Vice President Emeritus of The International Union of Police Associations (IUPA), a major police union, has used Goodyear’s statements to determine the company’s values. He said, “Goodyear is a profit-making corporation and that’s the decision that they made. We support the First Amendment, of course, but that’s fine for them. They have a choice of who they’re going to support. Our members, and those who support our members, have a choice of where we buy our tires.”

To police officers, a rejection of “Blue Lives Matter” is not merely a political stance, but a callous statement of disregard for their lives. “To see today, a company that has made millions of dollars off police officers publicly declare that they don’t care about their lives, their very lives, that it’s unacceptable for an employee to support their beliefs is just disgusting,” Johnson said. “At the same time, the company says it’s OK for their employees to support a group that calls for the murder of police officers. It’s just disgusting.”

Andrew Smith, the chief of police in Green Bay, Wisconsin, put the anti-Blue Lives Matter sentiments in perspective, remembering the police that have died in the line of duty and how the slogan refers to lives that have been lost.

“There’s been lots of talk about the Goodyear and Black Lives Matter business. I refer people to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which reports all of the officers that have been killed. We lost 159 officers from the United States in line of duty deaths this year so far. That’s more than last year, and I guarantee you that every one of those blue lives mattered,” he said.

Police deaths in the line of duty are up 64 percent from last year. Further, the number of lives lost so far in 2020 already exceeds the total deaths of last year.

Many expressed that Blue Lives Matter is not to the exclusion of other lives, just an expression of support for the dangerous job that is policing. Smith said the Goodyear issue “speaks volumes about where we are as a country.”

“When wearing something as simple as ‘Blue Lives Matter,’ which doesn’t exclude other lives – and many of the blue lives killed this year happened to be black officers – I’m having a hard time understanding how that could be offensive to somebody” he said.

Lamon said, “They’ve taken that stance of ‘Blue Lives Matter upsets people.’ I think it’s ridiculous. In my opinion, all lives matter. It shouldn’t just be one group. Everyone’s life matters, whether it’s a Blue life or Black life or Hispanic life or Asian life.”

Some of the dismay comes from the frequent use of Goodyear tires on police cars, and the positive association they previously elicited. Johnson said, “The thing that’s worst of all is that Goodyear, for decades, has made a tremendous profit by selling their products, their tires in particular, to police departments and to manufacturers like Ford, who built police vehicles. For a long time, Goodyear tires was what you wanted to have on your police car.”

Smith noted that, while his police car was using Firestone, “I’ve got Goodyear tires on our personal car right now, I just looked to see. I’m really surprised that the company would come out with an anti-Blue Lives Matter training.”

This branding of Goodyear is not accidental on the company’s part. On the section of their website which specifically sells tires for police vehicles, they refer to themselves as the “recognized leader for police pursuit tires.” To then turn around and ban employees from workplace advocacy supporting a sizable customer base, while allowing demonstrated support for an openly anti-police group, feels like a betrayal to many officers.

The frustrations with Goodyear and the anti-cop crowd are tempered somewhat by stories of positive community interactions. “I think a large majority of the American public supports their police,” Johnson said. Chief Andrew Smith of the Green Bay told a heartwarming story of his near inability to go out in public without being stopped by several people intending to wish him well and express their support for the police. Andy Erbaugh of Tyler, Texas likewise expressed positivity, saying, “We’ll continue to do our jobs. The people in our town love us, we love them, and we’ll continue protecting them.”

Likewise, there was a perception that more widespread public support would return to the police. Lamon discussed how the unfeasibility of many proposals from the anti-cop crowd will likely bring people back to reason.

“I think that the pendulum swung one way, but it will swing back the opposite way when people see that we actually do perform a service that they need,” Lamon said. “When you get these people that say, ‘defund the police,’ well then, who’s going to take care of the people that need help? It’s ridiculous. People make comments, and then people rally behind it.”

In regards to decisions on how to proceed, the opinions were mixed. Both the IUPA and NAPO made this suggestion for anyone who supports the police: stop buying Goodyear tires.

“The feedback I have heard, and I will admit that most of the people with whom I interact are quite of the same mind I am, that they would no more buy Goodyear tires,” Slocumb said. “It’s not like you don’t have a choice. We would support anyone who supports the police not buying Goodyear.”

Johnson stated, “Our group would encourage not just individual officers and their families and their friends and their neighbors to avoid Goodyear products, but police departments, manufacturers, and the companies which service police vehicles. Stay away from Goodyear.”

Some, however, are not quite ready to end their longstanding relationship with the company just yet, and want to give Goodyear an opportunity to amend their hardline stance. Unready to write them off just yet, Smith said he wants “to see what Goodyear’s response is when they learn how people across the country feel about the [anti-cop] training.”

"While Claiming To Champion Justice, Democrats Are Letting Cities Burn","The leaders of the Democratic Party think they are destroying America in order to save it. Our nation’s urban revival, of which New York City was the preeminent example, was one of the great successes of the last few decades. Now this achievement is in danger as the costliest civil unrest in American history drags on, enabled by the deliberate fecklessness of Democratic leaders.

Nightly riots and assaults in Portland, massive organized looting in Chicago, and escalating violence in NYC and elsewhere are still ongoing as police are pulled back. The destruction and pillaging have devastated local economies already wounded by the Chinese coronavirus.

The Democrats who run our cities have stood by and allowed them to be ravaged, and many people and businesses have had enough and are leaving. Years of economic development and crime reduction are being undone by the incompetence and malice of Democratic leaders, motivated by a mix of ideology and cynicism.

Democrats Are Undoing Years of Progress

Ideologically, many are supine before any claim or deed on behalf of “racial justice,” no matter how spurious. Thus, the same mayors who closed playgrounds in response to the Chinese coronavirus encouraged mass protests. Some have tacitly accommodated vandalism and violence as legitimate forms of protest and treated looting as justified reparations.

Amid the destruction, the national media repeat the words “mostly peaceful” to the point of absurdity, using protests as moral cover for vandalism, arson, looting, assault, and even murder. Democratic leaders have followed suit. For example, Seattle’s mayor endorsed the armed occupation of part of her city, which began with assault and extortion and predictably ended with multiple murders. Many other local Democratic leaders appear sympathetic to the destruction and rioting, permitting and downplaying it while offering only tepid condemnations of the worst violence.

Other more cynical Democrats see the chaos as a political weapon against President Donald Trump. If he does not intervene against the rioting, he appears weak; if his administration acts to quell it, Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accuse him of being an incipient dictator deploying stormtroopers.

Regardless of the reason — ideological insanity or as a cynical strategy to win an election — it is folly to trash America’s cities. The damage has been much worse than reported in legacy media, and the worst suffering will fall on those city-dwellers the Democrats claim to champion.

Attempts to rein in the destruction have been halfhearted and often underscore just how bad the situation is. After Chicago’s famous Magnificent Mile was sacked, again, by organized looters (some even brought U-Hauls to facilitated the pillaging), the city started raising bridges to limit access to downtown, literal drawbridges against barbarian invaders. Meanwhile, the nightly riots in Portland did not stop after federal agents left. In New York, Gov. Andrew “send the infected into the nursing homes” Cuomo is begging the wealthy to come back to New York City and continue paying for its outsized spending.

Even from the partisan Democratic perspective, the riots and unrest might do far more damage than good. Democrats hope the damage can be quickly repaired after a Biden-Harris victory in November and perhaps some police budget cuts, but what if crime doesn’t go back down, businesses don’t rebuild and reopen, and professionals continue to move away? What if we are in for decades of urban decay and subsequently increased crime?

Poor Minorities Will Suffer Most

Cities are not rebuilt automatically. Apologists for the rioting recite the refrain “they have insurance” as though every business has perfect riot insurance that will quickly settle all claims for the full value of everything destroyed, including months of lost revenue. But reality is not like an insurance commercial; many of the damaged and destroyed businesses are never coming back. Many people are deciding city life is no longer worth it.

America’s great cities are the heart of the Democratic Party, and the long-term effects of another period of urban decline are unclear. Perhaps Democrats could adapt. A diaspora from their urban strongholds might even help if those leaving retain their partisan allegiance. Or perhaps voters will decide to punish Democrats. Either way, the urban poor and minority voters Democrats claim to care for will bear the brunt of the decline.

Of course, Democrats are also responsible for the conditions being protested. Very few large cities are governed by Republicans, and Democrats have run many for generations. The problems of cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, and Milwaukee are not the GOP’s fault. The American urban revival did not lift everyone up. Some cities were left out, and those that got ahead still left neighborhoods and groups behind.

Thus, the rioting and unrest have highlighted the fractures in the Democrats’ high/low coalition, which is run by the (mostly white) educated and well-off, ostensibly on behalf of poor and minority voters. If big-city policing is racist, what does that say about the Democrats who have been running those cities? Likewise, if American education is institutionally racist, how can the reliably Democrat teachers’ unions, as well as left-wing professors and administrators, escape the blame?

Democrats Are Wasting Real Opportunities

The pieces of the Democratic Party do not fit well together. Compromise is intrinsic to coalition politics, but the Democrats are past compromise into incoherence. The interests of the corporate left and urban working class do not align. Likewise, the interests of the student-debt-ridden adjutant classes are inimical to those of the urban working class.

For example, slashing police budgets and replacing cops with social workers is a jobs program for (mostly) white women with college degrees, at the expense of working-class men of all races. This is why white radicals and their cultural obsessions, such as renaming football teams, have hijacked a movement supposedly dedicated to racial justice and police reform.

For those who genuinely care about police reform and racial equality, this is a wasted opportunity. Earlier this year President Trump, a populist Republican, was running for reelection on a record of criminal justice reform. This would have been unthinkable back in the days crime was so bad that Democrats such as Joe Biden were promoting get-tough policies. Public safety made reform palatable, but disorder might take it off the table.

After the horrifying alleged police killing of George Floyd, there was a chance for bipartisan reforms, but it has been wasted on rioting and radicalism. Democratic leaders chose to filibuster federal efforts at police reform. Changes and proposals have occurred at state and local levels, but too many are rooted in anti-police ideology. The solution to police misconduct is not no police, but better police. It does not help poor or minority citizens to deprive them of the law’s protection.

In service to their political goals, Democratic leaders have allowed, enabled, and encouraged tremendous damage to our nation. But destroying cities will not end racism nor increase racial equality. It might not even help the Democrats defeat Trump, let alone build a long-term governing majority (there are now a lot of new gun owners). All Democrats have ensured is suffering for the urban poor and marginalized, whose neighborhoods are destroyed, whose economic prospects are blighted, and who are now easier prey for criminals.

Regardless of whether Biden or Trump wins in November, we will all be stuck with the Democrats’ choice to let our cities burn.

"As Rioting Lights Up In Wisconsin, Democrat Governor Blames Police","MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers’ incendiary tweets after a police-involved shooting of a black man in Kenosha Sunday was like lighting the fuse of a bomb, conservative lawmakers say.

Now the Democrat is calling the legislature into special session to take up a package of “policing accountability and transparency measures,” a move Republican leadership see as the latest in a long line of Evers’ political stunts.

“One hour after the announcement of the speaker’s task force, Governor Evers releases a Special Session call of the Legislature,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said in a statement. “When I spoke to Governor Evers on the phone today, I asked him to work with the Legislature in a deliberate and open process through the task force.”

“We have an opportunity to bring people together to find solutions. Instead, the governor is choosing to turn to politics again by dictating liberal policies that will only deepen the divisions in our state,” Vos added.

Jacob Blake, 29, was in serious condition Monday after he was shot multiple times while getting into his car during what Kenosha police describe as a domestic incident. Soon after a video partially showing the incident hit social media, Evers hopped on Twitter and fired off sweeping indictments. While he acknowledged he didn’t have all the details, the governor was more than ready to pass judgment.

“[W]hat we know for certain is that he [Blake] is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,” Evers wrote.

Kenosha erupted in violence — or “unrest,” as corporate media tends to define riots.

On Monday, protesters set some 50 cars on fire in a nearby car lot, burned a few city garbage trucks, and damaged several public buildings, including the public library and the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and a charter school. They also attacked police, reportedly hitting an officer in the head with a brick and knocking him down. That incident, too, was caught on video.

Evers was forced to call in the National Guard, with more protests planned for Madison.

“I hesitate to do this, because the situation in Kenosha stands on its own, but I am extremely shocked by the content of Governor Evers’ statement last night,” state Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said in a statement. “The best leaders attempt to diffuse situations, not escalate them. Evers’ statement was irresponsible and inflammatory. He jumped to conclusions without first having all the facts. At a time when stereotyping situations is especially risky, Evers stereotyped every police interaction with people of color — harming both.”

Members of the GOP-led legislature acknowledged that the video of the police-involved shooting, in which Blake appears to be shot in the back multiple times, is disturbing on its face. But so is Evers’ rush to judgement.

“In less than 24 hours, we have unfortunately witnessed rioting, looting and incendiary statements from both Governor Tony Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes prejudging the circumstances of this officer-involved shooting,” Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) said in a statement.

As long as the governor is hastily calling a special session for next week, Nass urged Republican leadership to schedule a “concurrent extraordinary session” to pass legislation limiting the Evers’ administration’s “abuses of power.”

Nass, among other lawmakers, is calling for the legislature to rescind Evers’ statewide mask mandate of Aug. 1 and to “dramatically curtail” the powers of his Department of Health Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm. And he is again asking that the Senate meet and vote down Palm’s appointment.

Republican lawmakers have made it clear that they will not support any “reform” legislation that targets police funding.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/25/as-rioting-lights-up-wisconsin-democrat-governor-blames-police/,2020-08-25
Two Killed During Riots In Wisconsin As Governor Refuses Fed Assistance,"MADISON — It took Gov. Tony Evers two days to wake up and proclaim a “State of Emergency” exists in Wisconsin. Tuesday, after he issued the declaration, police say three people were shot and two killed during ongoing rioting in Wisconsin streets.

In his emergency declaration, the Democrat invoked the name of Minnesotan George Floyd and plugged a legislative special session to pass bills on “equity and justice.” While desperately clinging to the notion that the Black Lives Matter protests that have swept through Wisconsin and the nation are “mostly peaceful,” even Evers smelled the smoke from Kenosha and Madison.

Despite his declaration, rioters continued Tuesday night to burn down the Midwestern state’s modestly sized cities and attack local residents, their homes, and businesses.

“Unfortunately, some individuals have deviated from peaceful protest and have engaged in unlawful, harmful, and dangerous activities, including arson, which has endangered the lives of protesters and bystanders, which cannot be tolerated,” the governor’s Executive Order 86 declares.

Evers then called to active duty “such additional elements of the Wisconsin National Guard” as his appointed adjutant general “deems necessary” to support local law enforcement, protect critical infrastructure and cultural institutions and provide support to first responders. Yet he hasn’t called up enough law enforcement to even match the number of rioters continuing to burn down Wisconsin towns.

Local law enforcement in Wisconsin have told the White House they need at least 750 National Guard tonight. Governor Evers is only sending 250. Today, Mark Meadows called the Governor and offered 500 additional guard to meet the police needs. Governor Evers declined. https://t.co/ceqpDj3W2n — Ben Williamson (@_WilliamsonBen) August 26, 2020

Disturbing Scenes in Small-Town State

Evers’s less-than-swift move came after a second night of chaos in Kenosha and parts of downtown Madison. The riots in the two cities followed the police-involved shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man police say was at the scene of a domestic disturbance. Video from the shooting is disturbing, capturing Blake being shot several times in the back while he apparently disobeys police commands and climbs or reaches into the driver’s side of his vehicle.

Also disturbing are the scenes of rioting, looting, and violence, including the burning of public and private property and attacks on police officers. In Madison, about 500 protesters marching through the downtown area set dumpsters on fire, smashed windows, including at the Capitol, and looted multiple businesses, according to police.

“One business was entered, and members of the crowd poured what appeared to be gasoline inside it, then attempted to start a fire,” the incident report states. Police had to provide security to firefighters called in to battle multiple blazes. Rioters threw rocks, bottles, and other projectiles at police.

These latest riots are the third wave of protester destruction to hit the city this summer. As Empower Wisconsin has reported, Evers was slow to call in the National Guard during the riots of June 23-24, when protesters ripped down iconic Capitol statues, damaged several buildings, savagely attacked a state senator, and firebombed the City County Building.

Texts obtained by Empower Wisconsin show Evers and his staff failed to secure the Capitol grounds. In fact, Evers ordered Capitol Police to remain inside the building while rioters tore up the exterior and dragged down the statues.

Zach Madden, Evers’ legislative liaison, sent an update to lawmakers Tuesday morning, informing them that law enforcement responded to the “civil unrest that occurred at the Capitol.”

“For the second time this summer, my Capitol office was vandalized by a violent mob of rioters,” said state Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), in a statement. “While the damage to my office pales in comparison to the destruction of property and livelihoods happening in both Madison and Kenosha, it is emblematic of the growing disregard for the rule of law by some elected officials.”

Kapenga said the governor has the resources and the responsibility to stop the violence and destruction, “yet he foments division and destruction while hiding in the Governor’s Mansion with police protection.”

Several conservative lawmakers criticized the governor earlier this week when he took to Twitter just hours after the Blake incident and fired off incendiary blanket statements about law enforcement, accusing them of being at fault for rioters’ decision to kill and destroy.

‘The City Is Burning’

Early Tuesday, the Evers plan seemed to be boarding up Capitol windows. The Department of Administration sent lawmakers a notice telling them that the facilities crew was covering the exterior ground floor windows of the Capitol, the Risser Justice Center and the Tommy G. Thompson Center as a “precautionary measure.”

The victim is at the hospital. @RichieMcGinniss is there (he’s okay). Said he believes a second gunshot victim just arrived pic.twitter.com/jZf9v9fuqK — Shelby Talcott (@ShelbyTalcott) August 26, 2020

State Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) and Rep. Samantha Kerkman (R-Salem) sent Evers a letter begging him to take action to stop the rioting and lawlessness. The governor earlier had called up the National Guard to assist in Kenosha, but their presence seemed to have little impact. Neither did a 9 p.m. curfew issued by the city.

'HEARTBREAKING': Wisconsin Native On Covering The Chaos In Kenosha https://t.co/L90h1xTgQG — The Federalist (@FDRLST) August 26, 2020

“The city is burning. Residents are heartbroken, terrified for their lives and livelihoods and city. They are literally begging and crying for help,” wrote Wanggaard and Kerkman, who represent much of Kenosha County.

“Cornerstones of Kenosha, like the Danish Brotherhood, and small businesses have been destroyed, leaving hundreds of people unemployed. Rioters have tried to destroy irreplaceable historic buildings like the Simmons Library and Courthouse,” the lawmakers added. “The scars of this week cannot heal until the violence stops. The rioting must end.”

In a follow-up letter, the lawmakers expressed concern that the 250 Guard members the governor called up may not be enough to deal with the hundreds of demonstrators if they riot again. They said President Donald Trump had been in contact with the governor’s office and had offered federal law enforcement assistance.

In his executive order, Evers quoted Martin Luther King Jr., “That injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” There are a lot of people in Kenosha, Madison and communities across Wisconsin hoping the governor also sees the injustice in the destruction of businesses, neighborhoods and government buildings in the name of “social justice.”

Behind Trump's Pardon To African American Who Helps Prisoners Restart,"Less than 24 hours after Black Lives Matter activists torched Kensoha, Wisconsin, in the name of racial justice, President Donald Trump granted a surprise pardon to Jon Ponder, a black man and convicted bank robber who turned his life around and now devotes his work to helping others do the same.

“Jon, we honor your devotion to showing returning citizens that they are not forgotten,” Trump said from the White House. “I will continue to give all Americans, including former inmates, the best chance to build a new life and achieve their own American dream.”

In 2009, Ponder founded a prisoners’ reentry program called Hope for Prisoners in Las Vegas, Nevada. Upon his release after spending much of his life behind bars, Ponder experienced firsthand the challenges of reentering society and decided to do something to change it.

Hope for Prisoners assists men and women in reentering society after prison by providing them long-term support and services, such as job training, mentorship, and counseling. In 2012, as part of the program, Hope for Prisoners formed an unprecedented partnership with the Las Vegas Police Department. The partnership encourages police officers to engage with and mentor former inmates. Today, it involves more than 60 members of the department.

In the shadows of a national “defund the police” movement, this partnership reflects the important role police play not just in terms of law enforcement, but also in building meaningful relationships in the communities they serve. After speaking with Ponder and graduates of his program for Independent Women’s Forum, I learned how this aspect of the Hope for Prisoners’ program is mutually beneficial for both law enforcement officers and those they serve.

Hope for Prisoners enables former inmates to see police officers as human beings who put their lives on the line to fulfill the promise they made to protect and serve. At the same time, it affords police officers the opportunity to learn more about the long, complex, and painful life circumstances that often lead to arrests and incarceration. The partnership fosters empathy on both sides and is a model this nation desperately needs.

The partnership is so successful, some former inmates and cops have become lifelong friends. In May 2012, for example, after being arrested, Lois Hockersmith woke up in a hospital with three people by her side: a doctor, a police officer, and a priest. An undercover officer had picked her up for drugs and prostitution, and she had to deliver her 25-week-old son with whom she was too high to know she was pregnant. Miraculously, he survived.

Hockersmith, who was 35 at the time, grew up hating the cops and never went to them for help. But after realizing this officer saved not only her life but also her unborn son’s, she decided to enroll in Hope for Prisoners and turn her life around. As part of the healing process, Hockersmith set out to thank the officer who arrested her that night.

“Go figure, he turned out to actually be one of our trainers here at Hope,” Hockersmith said. Today, like Ponder and FBI agent Richard Beasley, who arrested and mentored him, the two remain close friends.

“Him and I actually teach together,” Hockersmith said. “On my son’s birthday, we go out and celebrate his birthday together with him and his kids.”

That’s Nice — But Let’s Still Cancel Him

Ponder’s story of faith, healing, and redemption is one all Americans should be able to rally behind. On cue because he spoke at the RNC, however, the media sought to cancel him.

“JON PONDER’s story is inspirational,” wrote Kenneth P. Vogel, a reporter for the New York Times. “But should he be endorsing a candidate for president while being identified as the founder & CEO of Hope for Prisoners, which — as a 501(c)(3) non-partisan non-profit group — is barred from participating in partisan politics?”

Of course, Vogel failed to mention that while federal tax laws do prohibit 501(c)(3) groups from being used for partisan electioneering, they don’t ban individuals who happen to work at them from having political opinions and sharing them publicly. Perhaps Vogel forgot about former President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea, who ran the Clinton Foundation for years while campaigning for Hillary Clinton, or Michelle Obama, who co-chairs When We All Vote.

Ponder deserved to be pardoned and prominently featured at the RNC. Moreover, it wasn’t about political opportunism. Trump took notice of Ponder far before “defunding the police” and Black Lives Matter became national protests, riots, and debates.

President Trump and Jon Ponder Go Back

Trump first met Ponder two years ago when the latter was a guest on the National Day of Prayer. The president took a liking to Ponder’s story and work and accepted an opportunity to speak at Hope for Prisoners’ graduation ceremony earlier this year. As he mentioned while granting Ponder an emotional, surprise pardon, Trump stayed at the graduation “for an hour and a half because it was so interesting to me,” instead of the five minutes that were originally scheduled. His support of Ponder’s program reflects the president’s genuine interest in criminal justice reform, which in 2018 resulted in a sweeping bipartisan federal prison and sentencing bill.

In pardoning Ponder and featuring him at the RNC, Trump did more than pay lip service to black Americans, who make up more than 38 percent of the inmate population despite representing only 14 percent of the general population. He closed a long, painful chapter in Ponder’s past and honored his role in enabling an estimated 3,000 former inmates to do the same.

Moreover, Trump not only recognized a man that’s giving former inmates a second chance. He shined a spotlight on an effort that’s giving law enforcement a second chance to build meaningful relationships with the communities they serve. If caring about black lives means more than a slogan, let’s hope Ponder’s model is replicated nationwide, with support from both sides.

"Minneapolis Riots, Looting Erupt Again After Suicide From Murder Suspect","Minneapolis erupted into a second wave of rioting and looting Wednesday night following the suicide of a male murder suspect when police approached him earlier in the day.

Minneapolis Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey declared a state of emergency and implemented an immediate curfew for 9:30 p.m. through 6 a.m., according to a local CBS affiliate. Frey also called in the National Guard to quell the renewed chaos sweeping his city just three months after rioting following George Floyd’s death on May 25. After Floyd’s death in police custody with a life-threatening amount of fentanyl in his body, the state’s Democrat Gov. Tim Walz deployed more than 5,000 troops to restore public safety.

Police say the suicide victim was the suspect in a Wednesday afternoon shooting near the Nicollet Mall.

Walz condemned the rioting on Twitter and pledged resources to local officials in their support.

“Minneapolis, it’s time to heal,” Walz wrote. “We must rebuild and recover. Dangerous, unlawful behavior will not be tolerated. The State Patrol is headed to Minneapolis to help restore order. I remain in close contact with the city and every state resource stands ready to help bring peace.”

The resurgence of civil unrest in the struggling community just two months after its city council unanimously voted to dismantle the police department rises concurrently with new riots exploding in Kenosha, Wisconsin as the nation’s new hotspot for anarchic terrorism following the Sunday shooting of Jacob Blake by police after he fought with officers and reportedly sought a knife.

On Tuesday, Wisconsin’s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency as the riots spread to Madison. He accepted federal support Wednesday after initially refusing help from the White House that local law enforcement requested.

Kenosha’s riots turned deadly Tuesday after gunshots rang out among demonstrators killing two and leaving another in the hospital. At least 32 people have been killed since the historic outbreak of civil unrest began in the aftermath of Floyd’s death.

Portland has also continued to suffer under anarchic turmoil, recently hitting 90 days of consecutive domestic terrorism suffocating the Oregon city this week.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/27/minneapolis-riots-looting-erupt-again-after-suicide-from-murder-suspect-approached-by-police/,2020-08-27
Police Recover Weapon From Vehicle Of WI Shooting Victim Jacob Blake,"Jacob Blake had a weapon on the driver’s side of his vehicle when a police officer, who has now been identified as Rusten Sheskey, shot him seven times in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Sunday evening. Blake was leaning into that side of the vehicle when the officer discharged his weapon.

According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, police recovered a knife from the floorboard, but the agency did not say whether Blake, a 29-year-old black man, was holding the weapon when Sheskey shot him in the back, which left Blake paralyzed, according to his family’s lawyers. Video stills of the incident appear to show Blake holding a small object resembling a knife prior to the shooting, but the department has not confirmed nor denied that detail.

During the investigation, Blake admitted to having the knife, according to officials. Police didn’t recover any other weapons.

Sheskey, who gripped Blake’s shirt as he fired his gun at the man’s back, has been put on administrative leave. The officer has been with the Kenosha Police Department for seven years.

According to a DOJ news release, officers were responding to a domestic dispute call from a woman who said her boyfriend was present but was not permitted to be on the premises. During the encounter, officers tried to arrest Blake, grappled with him on the ground, and used a Taser, but these weren’t successful in apprehending him.

According to the release and visible on a neighbor’s video of the incident, next “Mr. Blake walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward,” before Sheskey fired his gun. No other police officers fired their weapons.

Although Kenosha leaders had unanimously greenlighted a plan in 2017 to purchase body cameras for law enforcement officers, police were still not equipped with them. The uncertainty of details about objectionable encounters with law enforcement underscores the need for the recording devices to maintain accountability among officers and the accuracy of reporting.

After the shooting, the officers immediately administered medical aid to Blake until Flight for Life transported him to a Milwaukee hospital, where he is now located, according to the DOJ release. All officers involved in the incident were also placed on administrative leave and are cooperating with an ongoing investigation.

The Wisconsin DOJ’s Division of Criminal Investigation, which probes shootings involving police officers, will compile an investigative report and turn it over to the prosecutor within 30 days of the incident. The prosecutor will then decide whether to levy any charges against the officers in question.

According to court records, an arrest warrant was issued against Blake on July 7 for felony third-degree sexual assault, as well as misdemeanor charges of criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, all related to domestic abuse.

In the wake of the Blake shooting, violent rioters set Kenosha ablaze. Arsonists ignited private property ranging from dumpster fires in the streets to infernos engulfing an entire car lot. Despite Mayor John Antaramian instituting an 8 p.m. curfew, anarchists broke windows and looted local stores throughout the night, leaving small business owners and locals reeling after the Wuhan coronavirus had already left many with uncertainty and financial insecurity.

Lawlessness escalated Tuesday night in Kenosha when three shootings in the streets left two people dead and another wounded. Police apprehended the alleged shooter, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse from Antioch, Illinois, Wednesday morning, charging him with first-degree intentional homicide.

The mayhem in Kenosha comes even as the dust is still settling in other cities across the country from riots that broke out after the tragic death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody at the end of May. As The Federalist’s Tristan Justice reported, “On Tuesday, anarchic militants in Portland continued their 90th consecutive night of terror, having already injured about 300 sworn state and federal agents with injuries ranging from minor wounds to serious eye damage.” Since Floyd’s death, more than 30 people have been killed due to the riots, as of Wednesday. Democrats made no mention of the lawlessness during last week’s Democratic National Convention.

Although many in the media continue to insist the so-called protests are mostly peaceful — even as cities burn behind reporters — some people are starting to realize the lack of law and order is all too real — and in fact, is damning for Democrats, who have failed to uphold the rule of law, keep their cities under control, and condemn violence, even as the 2020 election looms.

“In Kenosha County, where the president won by fewer than 250 votes in 2016, those who already supported Mr. Trump said in interviews that the events of the past few days have simply reinforced their conviction that he is the man for the job,” The New York Times reported Wednesday. “But some voters who were less sure of their choice said the chaos in their city and the inability of elected leaders to stop it were currently nudging them toward the Republicans.”

The article continued, “And some Democrats, nervous about condemning the looting because they said they understood the rage behind it, worried that what was happening in their town might backfire and aid the president’s re-election prospects.”

Virginia Senate Passes Bill To Reduce Sentences For Assaulting Police,"Virginia’s Democratic Senate passed legislation Wednesday reducing penalties for assaulting police officers by allowing judges discretion to diminish charges from a felony to a misdemeanor.

Though the bill maintains that such aggression be charged as a felony, judges under the law would be empowered to distinguish between minor and serious assaults while also eliminating the six-month mandatory minimum prison sentence for convictions.

According to the Loudoun Times, the bill passed despite Republican objections that the bill would minimize acts of terror targeted at police as law enforcement units nationwide bear the brunt of historic animosity and anarchic calls to defund their departments. Several local governments have already opted to either completely dismantle their law enforcement agencies such as Minneapolis where rioting erupted again Wednesday, or to axe funding to redirect it to other programs. New York City cut $1 billion from its police budget earlier this year.

The Virginia Senate’s bill will now move to the Democrat-controlled House of Delegates. Their decision comes while scores of police officers have come under attack sustaining serious injuries across the country. Militant demonstrators have launched mortar-style fireworks at sworn agents of public defense and beamed lasers that can cause permanent blindness.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/27/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-reduce-sentences-for-assaulting-police/,2020-08-27
"Watch: Widow Of David Dorn, Retired Police Chief Slain By Mob, Recounts Harrowing Story And Endorses Trump","Thursday night at the Republicans’ virtual convention, Ann Dorn, a widowed wife and mother of five newly fatherless children, recounted the heart-wrenching tale of her black husband David’s death just three months ago at the hands of the virulent mob.

David, 77, spent nearly four decades protecting St. Louis as a police officer and had come out of retirement to serve as the Moline Acres police chief. He lost his life in the line of duty from violent anarchists invading the streets in the streak of terror that gripped the nation following George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody.

“I re-live that horror in my mind every single day,” Ann Dorn told the prime-time audience at the Republican National Convention (RNC). “My hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from the nightmare we are witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change.”

Ann Dorn continued, offering a compelling testimony in support of the men and women tasked with defending the nation’s streets everyday facing historic animosity from the cultural left.

“Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest,” Dorn said.

They do not safeguard black lives. They destroy them. President Trump understands this and has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help. We must heal before we can effect change, but we cannot heal amid devastation and chaos. President Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities, not fewer. We need to come together in peace and remember that every life is precious.

David Dorn is just one of more than 30 who have died from the violent demonstrations striking American cities in a historic summer of civil unrest.

Police Break Up Apparent Antifa Plot To Light Kenosha On Fire,"MADISON — Mainstream media accounts on Thursday described a fourth night of riots in Kenosha as “mostly peaceful” after three previous nights of deadly disorder that ripped up portions of Wisconsin’s fourth-largest city and led to three people shot and two dead.

Things could have been a lot worse in Kenosha Wednesday night if local and federal law enforcement officials hadn’t stopped an out-of-state convoy reportedly bent on destruction. As Empower Wisconsin reported, Kenosha police and U.S. Marshal agents stopped a caravan of vehicles filled with fuel cans and illegal fireworks — thanks to a citizen tip.

Officers located a black school bus, bread truck, and minivan and took up surveillance, according to the incident report. Police then followed the vehicles to a gas station where they observed the occupants of the black bus and bread truck fill multiple cans of gas.

Police say the vehicles contained various items, including helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, and suspected controlled substances. Nine individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct and are awaiting charging decisions by the Kenosha County district attorney, according to the incident report.

“They clearly prevented more tragedy in the Kenosha area. We’re grateful for their presence,” state Rep. Janel Brandtjen (R-Menomonee Falls) said of the federal agents working with local law enforcement.

The vehicles reportedly were connected to Seattle-based Riot Kitchen, a group of radical left protesters that claims to “feed the revolution.” They were portrayed in several mainstream media accounts as friendly helpers. What the stories couldn’t explain is why members of the organization were loading up so many cans of gas, and why the Riot Kitchen crew in the minivan fled from police.

After Democrat Gov. Tony Evers initially turned down an offer from the Trump administration and Kenosha County begged him to send in more law enforcement, on Wednesday Evers announced he would call up 500 Wisconsin Army National Guard members to stem riots burning down the city. The governor still seemed to bypass federal involvement in his spite for President Donald Trump.

Evers defended his handling of the riots during a press conference Thursday in Kenosha. The governor claimed he fulfilled every request local officials made to the state, according to Wispolitics.com.

“The people on the ground here in Kenosha asked us for x. We provided x. The next day they asked for y, and we provided y,” Evers said, as Wispolitics.com reported. He also said he made it to Kenosha as quickly as he could — four days after the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake after Blake scuffled with police while possessing a knife.

Evers was holed up in Madison, and certainly had time to send out incendiary tweets pandering to his political base and calling a legislative session on police policy reform, all while Kenosha burned. State Sen. Dave Craig (R-Town of Vernon) said Evers not only failed to protect the people of Kenosha, but his bumbling response put police and National Guard members in peril.

“His lack of foresight to make sure those parties were protected is total negligence on the part of the administration that has to be further investigated,” he said. “No community should have to wait for federal intervention when the state government has the ability to protect its citizens, with an immediate response.”

Portland Protestors Occupy Mayor Ted Wheeler’s Apartment Building Demanding His Resignation,"A group of activist protestors organized a sit-in at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s apartment building on Friday, demanding that he “reduce the Portland Police Bureau budget, commit to never voting for police budget increases again, and resign.”

The demand letter also commands Wheeler, who it labels as a “true embodiment of white supremacy” to “complete abolition of the Portland Police Bureau by 2022, with no private or technological replacement” and redirect the money from the PPB into social programs.

Local news reports claim there were “about 10 people inside the lobby,” but that a larger crowd—estimated to include over 100 people—congregated outside the building playing loud music, dancing, chanting, and holding various signs.

While the crowd of protestors outside the building dissipated later that night, rioters gathered around the Portland Police Association building and attempted to set it ablaze, ultimately choosing to light a dumpster mattress on fire instead. According to local news, “the situation was quickly declared a riot, and multiple arrests were made.”

Over the last few months, Portland has suffered massive violence and damage from rioters protesting police brutality in light of George Floyd’s death. Many of these attacks by rioters have been targeted at the PPA, with destruction and vandalism even targeting a memorial to a fallen police officer.

One Dead In Portland After Pro-Trump Caravan Clashes With Protestors,"Another night of riots in Portland turned deadly when a President Trump supporter wearing attire with the emblem of “Patriot Prayer,” a conservative group against the leftist domestic terror group Antifa, was fatally shot on Saturday. The shooting was documented on multiple video livestreams that show a small group of people yelling, then scattering after shots were fired.

The Portland Police Bureau reports that the man died of a “gunshot wound to the chest,” but no suspect was named in the homicide investigation as of Sunday morning.

“This violence is completely unacceptable and we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible,” said Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell.

Antifa and Black Lives Matter protestors rallied and cheered at the announcement of the victim’s death, claiming that “he was a f—ing Nazi!” and that “our community held its own.”

Foundation With Biden Ties Funding Leftist Agitators On U.S. Streets,"Last Sunday, the site of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte witnessed a night of violence leading to at least five arrests. Since Friday, Black Lives Matter activists terrorized the Queen City, including beating police officers, in an effort to intimidate GOP attendees and business owners.

By contrast, the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee brought only a small gathering of peaceful activists, who declared: “We decided that it would make sense for us to make the emphasis of our action the one point of unity that deals with police crimes.”

Here we have a real “tale of two cities.” To understand the disparity of these two convention host cities separated by only a week, let’s examine some financiers of organizations fomenting the riots now taking place across the country.

Big Money, Connections to Top Democrats

Claiming to be America’s second-largest private foundation, the Ford Foundation has poured almost $2 billion into groups active in “disrupting systems to advance social justice,” according to its grant database.

The Ford Foundation boasts key members of the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaign as alumni executives. Harris’s sister and ex-campaign chairwoman Maya Harris served as the Ford foundation’s vice president alongside Biden’s now senior advisor, Cristóbal Alex, who served as its program director during the Obama presidency.

Some of Obama’s top staffers are now Ford Foundation’s top staffers. Taara Rangarajan, now Ford’s chief of staff, served as Obama’s national security advisor from 2013-2016. Before that, she served as a special assistant to Susan Rice during the Benghazi affair. Another Ford exec, Xavier de Souza Briggs, served as President Obama’s associate director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Funding for Communist-Connected Street Agitators

During the final months of the Obama presidency, Ford Foundation gave prominent leaders of the communist Workers World Party (WWP) funding to form the Southern Vision Alliance (SVA), a collective of activists that includes members of the group raining down terror in Charlotte last week at the RNC convention.

Shortly after getting $200,000 from the Ford Foundation in 2016, these activists performed one of the first violent and illegal teardowns of a historic monument in the country, in Durham, North Carolina. After the activists were arrested and charged for rioting and property damage, they are being defended in court, for free, by lawyers from another Ford grantee: the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.

Flush with Ford Foundation cash, these activists continue to promote property destruction and violence during demonstrations.

The Ford Foundation likes what it sees in the alleged criminal gang. This year, the wealthy nonprofit gave the group $750,000, more than tripling its inaugural donation, bringing Ford’s total contributions to SVA so far $1.2 million, according to the foundation’s website.

Millions for Marxists

Marxist-Leninist groups also get Ford Foundation support. Directed by Bernie Sanders’s senior advisor Phillip Agnew, the Dream Defenders group seeks the release of criminals from prison and the “end to the Capitalist system in the United States,” according to its now-scrubbed web page. The Ford Foundation has given the group $1.1 million, according to its grant database.

Social media accounts show the Marxist activists campaigning for Democrat mayors, state attorneys, and prosecutors in Florida who promise to end cash bail, defund the police, and free hardened criminals from jail.

Dream Defenders’ tactics vary: they shut down bridges in Florida, holding thousands of commuters hostage during rush-hour traffic; block entrances to Miami neighborhoods, threatening residents with unrelenting “civil unrest”; and shut down awards ceremonies for law enforcement, all in an effort to raise awareness for Democrats’ de-policing policies.

It’s time to build a BLACK united front ✊🏾 Meet us at the Black National Convention on Friday at 7 PM ET for a virtual experience like no other convention 😎 RSVP today: https://t.co/UrfFEW0zKq #BNC2020 #BlackLivesMatter #BlackNovember #M4BL pic.twitter.com/FUHr5TMjb9 — Movement 4 Black Lives (@Mvmnt4BlkLives) August 26, 2020

A tour through the Ford Foundation grant database shows Southern Vision Alliance and Dream Defenders to be a tiny part of these riot-fomenting groups agitating on American streets. While activists Ford funds desecrate cities and terrorize regular folks, the foundation gives millions to the “Defund the Police” movement.

As I reported in the National Pulse, Ford cheers the success of its anti-police campaign. From its website: “Already, we’ve seen our grantees at the forefront of the change that’s taken place over the last few days—from the City Council of Minneapolis’s pledge to dismantle the police department to reimagine public safety to Mayor Garcetti’s commitment to divest $250 million of the LAPD’s budget to support affected communities, to Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon voting to end the presence of police in their schools.”

Cities that have sought to cripple their police departments in acquiescence to such agitators’ demands have forced out police chiefs and seen officers leave the force. The result: murders and violent crimes, including shootings, assaults, and rapes, have increased exponentially in the nation’s biggest metros, according to multiple reports.

Accountable to No One

The Ford Foundation is financing a network of insurgents that intimidate elected officials and citizens to bring about dangerous political change. The FBI defines using intimidation and violence to achieve political ends as domestic terrorism.

Like other private foundations, Ford is governed only by basic IRS filing requirements and has virtually no public oversight. With woke leaders like Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins, Ford Motor Company’s Henry Ford III, and abortion giant Planned Parenthood’s former president Cecile Richards sitting on Ford’s board, be assured it will not cut off the funding to these Democrat street squads.

Why Kenosha Police Officers’ Use Of Force On Jacob Blake Was Justified,"A week ago Sunday, social media erupted when a graphic video emerged showing a white Kenosha, Wisconsin police officer shoot, multiple times, a black man in the back as he attempted to enter a vehicle containing three children. The man later identified as 29-year-old Jacob Blake survived, and remains hospitalized.

As the video went viral, violence erupted in this mid-sized Wisconsin community. Rather than call for calm, Wisconsin’s first-term governor, Democrat Tony Evers, fueled the outrage by framing the shooting as yet another “Black man or person” “shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.”

While acknowledging “we do not have all of the details yet,” Evers nonetheless stressed that “Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight.” He promised to “stand against excessive use of force” in a statement all but declaring the police officer a criminal.

Riots Escalate Immediately

The street violence escalated that night, and by Monday morning rioters had set a fire at a county courthouse, broken windows and spray-painted graffiti at the Kenosha County administrative building, and incinerated the lot of a nearby auto dealership, as well as dump trucks and garbage trucks.

Things worsened on Tuesday. During intensified rioting, two men were killed and a third injured by 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse, who has been charged with multiple felonies, including first-degree murder, is claiming self-defense in the shootings.

By Wednesday, the narrative — that a white police officer had without justification shot an unarmed black many seven times in his back in front of his three young children — was making other waves. The Milwaukee Bucks declared a boycott of the NBA playoff, other teams followed, and then the NHL. Then Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden entered the fray.

“What I saw on that video makes me sick,” Biden announced. “Once again a black man, Jacob Blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight with the whole world watching,” Biden said in a video posting, adding “he had spoken to Blake’s family and assured them that ‘justice must and will be done.’” Like his fellow Democrat Evers, Biden then pronounced judgment on the officers by applauding those protesting the police.

While this narrative was dominating the news and social media, more facts began to dribble out. On Friday, a lawyer for the Kenosha police union issued a statement exposing even more details. Those facts—which are verified by audio and video recordings, the onboard Taser memory units, and physical evidence—establish that the shooting of Blake was legally justified.

The media, most Americans, and professional athletes have no understanding of what constitutes “reasonable force” for police. Yes, it sometimes includes shooting a man, in broad daylight, in the back seven times.

Let’s Go Through Legal Principles for Use of Force

Well-established legal principles govern the use of “deadly force” by law enforcement officers. Initially, it is important to stress that the law is clear that an officer cannot use deadly force “merely to prevent a felon’s escape.” Thus, shooting Blake would not be justified based solely on the fact that there was an outstanding felony charge against Blake and the officers were attempting to arrest him.

However, while generally police may not use deadly force to effectuate an arrest, the Supreme Court has made clear that deadly force may be used if “the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or others.”

In the videos, Blake appeared to be armed with a knife. It has been established that a knife was found in the car he was reaching into, although whether he possessed it during his altercation with police is unclear. The mere fact that Blake may have been armed with a knife, though, also does not justify the shooting. Rather, objective reasonableness is determined based on “whether the totality of the circumstances justified the use of force.”

In determining the objective reasonableness of force, consideration is given to the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight, the suspect’s demeanor, whether the suspect is intoxicated or noncompliant, whether the suspect has a weapon, whether the officers ordered the suspect to drop the weapon, the distance separating the officers and the suspect, and whether any hostile motions with the weapon were made.

The key question in this analysis is whether the suspect “poses a threat.” “A nascent threat can be sufficient; it need not materialize to the point of harm.” Thus, an officer need not wait until a suspect knives or shoots someone, but “may anticipatorily use a weapon to protect himself or others.” In other words, “[i]t is the perceived threat of attack by a suspect, apart from the actual attack, to which the officer may respond preemptively.”

Put otherwise, “a reasonable officer need not await the ‘glint of steel’ before taking self-protective action; by then, it is ‘often . . . too late to take safety precautions.’”

Let’s Return to the Scene

Against these well-established legal principles, then, let’s return to the scene of the Blake shooting on August 23, 2020. Officers were dispatched to the home of Blake’s on-again, off-again girlfriend when she called 911. A dispatcher told officers the caller said Blake “isn’t supposed to be there,” and that he “took the complainant’s keys and is refusing to give them back.” A moment later, the dispatch informed officers that “we have an alert at this address for a 99 for this subject,” meaning there was an outstanding warrant for Blake’s arrest.

Before officers could arrive, dispatch informed them the caller had become uncooperative and said Blake had left then hung up. While Blake’s family and the police present two starkly different versions of what occurred at that point, video, audio, and physical evidence can easily confirm the following.

Blake was struggling with the officers before the shooting, and two separate officers discharged Tasers at Blake, but the Tasers failed to subdue him. Video also captured Blake struggling with the officers as they tried to arrest him, but Blake was able to break free. Video then showed Blake, with what may have been a knife in his hand, walk around the SUV, open the driver’s side door, and move towards the interior of the automobile. (The knife was later recorded on the floor of the SUV.)

While Blake advanced toward the automobile, the officers appear to have been shouting for him to drop the knife. As Blake moved to get inside the SUV, one officer held his shirt and then fired seven shots. Blake’s three children were inside of the SUV, and according to the children’s mother, Laquisha Booker, the officers knew “they were in there because I kept screaming that.”

These facts make clear that the officer’s shooting of Blake was justified for two independent reasons. First, courts recognize that “deadly force is presumptively reasonable” when an “officer could reasonably have interpreted the suspect’s movement as ‘reaching for a weapon.’”

When Blake ignored the officers’ commands and instead opened the SUV and leaned in with his upper body, the officers could reasonably have believed Blake was going for a gun, justifying the use of deadly force. As a legal matter, that the officer shot Blake seven times, and not once or twice, is irrelevant because the fact that “multiple shots were fired does not suggest the officers shot mindlessly as much as it indicates that they sought to ensure the elimination of a deadly threat.”

Blake’s Realistic Threat to the Kids Inside the SUV

While police had a legal right to shoot Blake to protect themselves, protecting the three innocent children in the SUV provides an even stronger justification for the shooting. The officers who had responded to the 911 call knew from dispatch several facts: Blake was “not supposed to be there”; he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest; and he had taken the caller’s keys.

They also knew that Blake had resisted arrest; two Taser shots failed to incapacitate Blake; Blake may have been armed with a knife; Blake refused to comply with the officers’ commands; a panicked mom was screaming that her kids were in the car; and that Blake was attempting to enter the SUV.

Under these circumstances, an officer could reasonably believe that Blake posed a threat of serious physical harm to the three young children, either directly, by means of a weapon he possessed in the closed quarters of the automobile, or indirectly by attempting to evade police with the kids, aged 8, 5, and 3, hostage in the backseat of the SUV.

A lawyer for Blake’s family is attempting to spin Blake’s conduct as innocent, claiming he was merely checking to ensure his kids were okay. Even if that was a believable explanation for Blake’s behavior, however, in judging the reasonableness of a police officer’s conduct, the law makes clear that facts must “be filtered through the lens of the officer’s perceptions at the time of the incident,” “considering what the officer perceived and knew at the time, “rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.”

In addition, “the calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.”

Or, as the courts say, “We must never allow the theoretical, sanitized world of our imagination to replace the dangerous and complex world that policemen face every day. What constitutes ‘reasonable’ action may seem quite different to someone facing a possible assailant than to someone analyzing the question at leisure.”

Should Police Have Instead Let Blake Drive Off?

While second-guessing is not appropriate, in this case, it is illuminating. While critics are claiming the officer didn’t have to shoot Blake, they fail to explain what the officer should have done instead.

Police attempted to Tase Blake—twice. They attempted to physically restrain Blake. Those efforts failed as well. There was but a split-second left to keep Blake from getting behind the wheel and escaping with the three children, while possibly armed. Shooting Blake was the only option left to ensure the children’s safety.

Despite attempts to now portray Blake as the happy family man, his threat to the children was real, as it, unfortunately, is in most cases involving domestic abuse.

According to Booker—now amazingly describing herself as Blake’s fiancé—in a May 2020 criminal complaint, she filed against him, over their eight-year on-again, off-again relationship Blake physically abused her. In the early morning of May 3, 2020, Booker told police that Blake, described as her “ex-boyfriend,” broke into her apartment and sexually assaulted her. He then stole the keys to her SUV and a debit card.

In the complaint of just three months ago, Booker also explained that over the past eight years, Blake has “physically assaulted her around twice a year when he drinks heavily.” The criminal complaint further revealed that Booker and Blake never resided together, that he is unemployed, has no vehicle, and refused to tell Booker where he was currently living.

While the officers did not know those facts at the time of their encounter with Blake, they knew enough to make them reasonably fear for the children’s safety (as well as their own), making the use of deadly force appropriate in this case. Yes, Blake remains hospitalized in critical condition, but better him than the three innocent children. Those black lives matter too.

Trump Will Not Denounce Armed Americans Acting If Police Stand Down,"When rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin last week burned down and looted businesses, the police did not stop them. We have seen this in cities across the country. No storeowner in Democratic-run areas that are subject to a leftist protest, which can “intensify” into riots, can have the slightest hope that the police will keep it from happening.

That being the case, they really have no choice but to defend their property themselves or let it go up in flames. President Trump will not denounce the constitutional right for them to do so, nor should he.

Trump could not have been more clear in his press conference on Monday that he wants police to handle all of law enforcement. Every sane person does. But it is just as clear that many Democratic mayors and governors are refusing to allow police to do so.

In some cases, this is because local law enforcement is overwhelmed, but in too many such cases Democratic mayors playing politics refuse the help of federal law enforcement. Thankfully, in Kenosha, the National Guard went in and quelled the violence, but in Portland help has not only been rejected, but derided, and the violence persists.

Demands for Trump to condemn such actions follow the alleged killing of two protesters by a 17-year-old in Kenosha last week. He had traveled from a nearby town to assist other armed men in defending local businesses.

Now let’s be clear: that teenager should not have been there. He should have been at a movie with his friends, not “playing cop” in a violent riot zone. But that doesn’t change the basic fact that Americans have the right to use guns to protect their property and property in their communities, especially if the police are not allowed or otherwise unable to do so.

This is a tale as old as America, whether it was homesteaders in the old West, or Korean storeowners during the Los Angeles riots. Americans are not going to see their life’s work destroyed because feckless Democratic mayors refuse to enforce the law. Pretending that armed citizens reacting to widespread destruction by trying to stop felonious behavior and riots are responsible for the riots is as absurd as blaming Trump for them. They are the fault of the leftist rioters themselves, and nobody else.

The corporate media think they have Trump in some kind of trap — as if he has to denounce this or else his criticisms of Biden staffers and Kamala Harris helping bail out rioters are hypocritical. But they aren’t. Telling Americans they have the right to defend their property is still a popular message — maybe not in the Hamptons or among celebrities and Democratic politicians with private security, but it sure is with many, many Americans.

Trump is absolutely correct that defending citizens’ property is a job best done by well-trained professional police. In fact, it is one of the central reasons police, and the government itself, exist at all: to protect private property.

This is why communists who don’t believe in private property want to defund or abolish the police. This is what happens when you defund or abolish the police. People who don’t want to be communists, who want to earn a wage and own property they can call their own, fight for it. That isn’t going to change.

People need to understand that if they try to burn or loot other people’s property, they are in danger of those people using violence to stop them. No matter how many glowing interviews NPR does with authors who find absurd justifications for stealing, people have a right to defend themselves, and they are going to do so.

President Trump is not going to tell them not to. Democrats might. They might say, “Just give the criminals what they want” — in fact, Democrats in Minneapolis literally did that — but no sensible people would even suggest it.

Trump knows he has a winning issue in law and order. It’s been a winning issue longer than the TV show named after it ran, which is a long time. Joe Biden knows it too. It’s why every day he has inched closer to condemning the actions of Black Lives Matter and Antifa without actually doing it.

Something has changed in this election. The media wants to stop that change by making Trump say people aren’t allowed to defend themselves. It’s an absurd notion on its face and shows just how desperate the president’s detractors are becoming.

"The Street Violence And Gunplay Started With The Left, Not The Right","In the wake of recent deadly clashes between Black Lives Matter activists and counter-protesters in Portland and Kenosha, Wis., the media is rolling out a new narrative: that right-wing extremists have introduced firearms to what have been, until now, “largely peaceful protests,” and BLM demonstrators are now trying to figure out how to keep themselves safe.

Consider an appallingly dishonest New York Times headline on Tuesday that declared, “As Guns Get Drawn at Protest Sites, Demonstrators Fear a Volatile New Phase.” The Times frames months of protests and street violence nationwide as “largely between protesters and the police, with the conflict playing out in tear gas volleys and lobbed projectiles.”

In this telling, the deadly clashes in Portland and Kenosha represent “a more perilous turn” because of the arrival of “right-wing activists” with firearms who are “bent on countering the racial justice protests with an opposing vision of America”—as if we’re seeing a peaceful and benign protest movement suddenly under threat from MAGA-hat-wearing militias.

As right-wing groups increasingly move to confront protesters in U.S. cities, demonstrators are assessing how to keep themselves safe https://t.co/g8jeTXjtTG — The New York Times (@nytimes) September 1, 2020

This is gaslighting on steroids. In fact, BLM protests have been violent from the beginning, long before “right-wing activists” showed up with guns. The list of shootings and violent crimes committed by BLM protesters is long, and it destroys the mainstream media’s false narrative that these protests have been peaceful.

There were the fatal shootings in Seattle’s CHOP back in June that left two teenagers dead and one wounded. There was the man who was burned to death inside a pawn shop during riots in Minneapolis in May. There’s all the footage of BLM activists attacking people in the streets, like the Portland man who was dragged from his truck and beaten unconscious by a mob last month. And of course, there’s been the persistent and widespread looting and mayhem in cities like Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, and elsewhere.

There has also been plenty of gunplay at these so-called protests, and any claim to the contrary is utterly divorced from reality. What follows is a partial list, just for the record.

BLM Gunman Reportedly Shoots Driver In Provo, Utah

In late June, 33-year-old Jesse Taggart was arrested in Provo, Utah, after police say he ran up to an SUV that drove past a BLM protest and shot the driver through the passenger-side window. The driver, a 60-year-old Provo resident, was not part of the protest or any counter-protest, but just happened to be driving by.

After he allegedly shot the man, Taggart reportedly ran after the vehicle as it was speeding away and fired another round, while another “protester” drew a weapon and pointed it at the SUV but did not fire. The driver got away but was later hospitalized.

After the shooting, Taggart put away his firearm and continued to protest, police said. “This same protester later approached another vehicle at 500 North and University Avenue, striking and breaking the window with the handgun.”

BLM Gunman Shot And Killed In Austin, Texas

On July 25 in Austin, Texas, BLM protester Garrett Foster was shot and killed after allegedly pointing his AK-47 at an Uber driver, later identified as U.S. Army Sgt. Daniel Perry, whose car had been surrounded by BLM protesters.

According to Perry’s attorneys, Perry mistakenly turned onto a street where a BLM march was taking place after dropping off Uber passengers. Perry, who has not been arrested or charged with a crime, told police that protesters surrounded his vehicle and began pounding on it, then Foster approached his vehicle and pointed an AK-47 at him. That’s when Perry fired on Foster, striking him multiple times.

Perry then drove away and called the police to report what happened. After Perry fired, a second gunman in the crowd fired a volley of shots at his vehicle as he drove away. Police are still investigating the shooting and calling for eyewitnesses to come forward.

BLM Gunman Arrested For Firing At Jeep In Aurora, Colorado

During a BLM protest in Aurora, Colo., in late July, 23-year-old Samuel Young allegedly shot at a Jeep that was trying to get through a crowd of protesters on the interstate. Young missed the Jeep but police say he hit two fellow protesters.

One of the victims was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries, the other was grazed by what police say was Young’s bullet. Young was later arrested and charged with four counts of attempted first-degree homicide and four counts of first-degree assault.

BLM Protesters Allegedly Fire Shotgun At Police Officer Outside His Home

In early August, a group of about 60 protesters gathered outside the home of a police officer in Wauwatosa, Wis., who is on paid administrative leave after fatally shooting a 17-year-old in February, a case that’s still under investigation. During the ensuing confrontation, one of the protesters allegedly fired a shotgun at the officer as he retreated into his home. Three men have since been arrested and charged.

All this to say, don’t believe The New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media when they try to tell you that firearms have only just been introduced to the toxic brew of BLM and Antifa mob action in our cities. If you haven’t heard about some of the above incidents, it’s because the media would rather pretend they never happened. They interfere with the narrative.

Firearms and violence have been part and parcel of these demonstrations from the very beginning. The only difference now is that counter-protesters, having seen this violence play out for months on end with no law enforcement or elected officials acting to stop it, are also arming themselves.

The result is no doubt going to be more bloodshed and likely more death. But please, let’s not pretend this didn’t start with left-wing extremists. We all know it did.

Why Is Drew Brees Wearing An Alleged Rapist's Name On His Helmet?,"Last Friday, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and his team broke with the pack to hold practice as nine other NFL teams canceled theirs in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake. They put Blake’s name in big black letters across the front of their helmets in what Sporstcasting.com writer Stephen Sheehan called “a powerful visual signal.”

New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton explained after practice that, “The idea of putting his name on everyone’s helmet was something we felt would be appropriate and they were for it.”

If Blake were an innocent family man who just happened to twitch during a tense encounter with police, this would all seem perfectly appropriate. There’s just one problem: not only was Blake aggressively resisting arrest in the incident that’s left him paralyzed, but he also had a warrant out for his arrest due to a charge of sexual assault.

According to research by The New York Post, Blake was forbidden from being at the Kenosha home where he was shot because of an incident at the same residence on May 3, for which there was an open warrant for his arrest. Based on police records, The New York Post describes the alleged assault:

The victim, who is only identified by her initials in the paperwork, told police she was asleep in bed with one of her children when Blake came into the room around 6 a.m. and allegedly said ‘I want my sh-t,’ the record states. She told cops Blake then used his finger to sexually assault her, sniffed it and said, ‘Smells like you’ve been with other men,’ the criminal complaint alleges.

According to the complaint, Blake then stole the keys from the woman’s purse and took her car, at which point she called 911. According to her report, about twice a year when he had been drinking heavily, Blake would come around and physically assault her.

Now, it could be that Brees and his teammates hadn’t seen this story break when they headed out for practice, as the New York Post published this information that same day. Yet it’s been five days now, and Brees has still not apologized for lionizing a man who, by the same standard corporate media has applied to other individuals, Blake is a credibly accused sexual assailant, trespasser, and car thief.

Now, I’m pretty sure that even before Me Too dominated headlines for months, everybody thought sexual assault was a pretty big deal. Even if you leave aside the facts about the shooting, which are damning enough, the Me Too movement makes the left’s view of Blake as a pure-hearted victim of police brutality grossly hypocritical and worthy of deepest scorn.

By the Me Too standard, even catcalling is considered to be a form of violence, but that’s not the standard being applied to Blake. If a Republican congressman had been accused of Blake’s actions in a police report by someone who had no apparent ulterior motive, the media would have permanently destroyed his career and reputation. They would have called the police heroes for protecting a woman and her children from what could have been another assault or kidnapping. Instead, they breathlessly covered the fact Blake was temporarily chained to his hospital bed in the aftermath of his fight with police as if it were some colossal injustice without apparently bothering to investigate why that might be the case.

Ever since the Access Hollywood audio surfaced of Donald Trump saying he grabbed women by the [expletive], and that “when you’re a star, they let you do it,” the media have generated a barrage of condemnation any time a Republican strays into indecency or worse. Remember the outrage over the alleged predator of teenagers and Senate candidate Roy Moore? Remember the all-out attack on then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh based on the word of one woman 30 years after the alleged rape—and when that wasn’t enough, airing a completely uncredible, fabricated account of a “gang rape” party where he was supposedly present, all to force him to withdraw his nomination?

Me Too was supposed to be a wake-up call to the world that sexual assault or leveraging power to manipulate women into sexual acts was absolutely unacceptable. Yet now, in 2020, an entire NFL team not only refuses to give up a myth about what happened (as the St. Louis Rams did when they performed their “hands up don’t shoot” virtue signal after Michael Brown’s death), but put the name of an alleged rapist on their helmets to show “respect, ”either knowingly, or because they felt virtue signaling was more important than waiting for important facts to come out about Blake’s character.

Brees caved once to massive pressure against his comments disapproving of kneeling to protest the flag. Instead of learning that the mob will drag you further and further into their radicalism if you submit, he gave in fully. Maybe this experience will serve as a lesson to him: that the left will go to any length to control people, up to and including making an instant martyr out of a man before doing any fact-checking about who he was — and downplaying those facts when they do.

CBS’s profile of Blake puts the “previous accusation of sexual assault” in a brief two sentences near the bottom of the article. A lengthy New York Times article weaving in details of both the Blake shooting and the related Kyle Rittenhouse shooting didn’t mention the alleged assault at all. CNN likewise buries it in their coverage with a single sentence devoid of detail.

Blake’s GoFundMe page has now raised more than $2.1 million. Sympathizers with Black Lives Matter’s push to empty prisons looked the other way while thousands of criminals who were turned loose on the streets over COVID proceeded to prey upon the innocent. Amid strong pushes to defund the police and extensive cover for rioters and looters, don’t expect the left to give up their double-standard on violent offenders. The narrative will change faster than you can say “Me Too,” and if people who care about protecting the vulnerable so much as blink, they’ll get away with it.

If Brees and the Saints do care about women and children’s safety, they should apologize to their fans for lionizing a credibly accused rapist.

Only Fact Left Needs To Jump On Rittenhouse Is That He Supports Trump,"Last week, a 17-year-old young man decided to pick up his AR-15 and patrol the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake. Hailing from Antioch, Illinois — a 30-minute drive away — Kenosha wasn’t his neighborhood. Even so, he wanted to assist the effort to maintain law and order.

In a video shot around 10 p.m., Kyle Rittenhouse explained his purpose, saying, “People are getting inured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there’s somebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself obviously. But I also have my med kit.”

At 11:30 p.m., video footage shows police offering Rittenhouse some water and telling him, “We appreciate you guys, we really do.” Fifteen minutes later, Rittenhouse was involved in an incident that resulted in him shooting three protestors, two of whom died. Arrested the next day, he has been charged with crimes that could land him in jail for the rest of his life.

Although much about what happened the night of August 25 remains unclear and needs to be fully contextualized, we’ve learned more about Rittenhouse in the days since. He’s been a supporter of the police for years. For his sixteenth birthday, he sought donations for a group that seeks to “forge stronger relationships between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.”

He’s been involved with cadet programs with local fire and police departments. He works as a YMCA lifeguard. With a medical kit strapped to his side on that fateful night, he can be seen offering services on the streets, including to protestors, saying “I am an EMT. If you are injured come to me.” Video footage shows he helped someone shot with a rubber bullet.

A Young Man Who Says He Wanted to Help

The word “help” pops up a lot when researching Rittenhouse. Indeed, earlier that fateful day he was photographed helping clean graffiti from a high school. It all paints a picture of a kid who values law and order and those who uphold it. Now, however, he stands charged as a murderer.

The legal process will play out over time, and there are more than a dozen videos that show the events of that night in great detail to help in that regard. Judicious minds are considering the merits of a self-defense claim and the requirements to prove the serious charges filed against him. But much of the media has already moved past the charges, skipped the trial, and are ready to pronounce guilt.

Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern released an article titled, “The Conservative Defense of Kyle Rittenhouse Is Dangerous Nonsense.” To underscore his point that we should never allow personal ideology to influence our views, he subtitled it with the inarguably neutral proclamation that, “White Americans’ most heinous acts of violence can always be justified by their ideological allies.”

The Atlantic’s Graeme Wood wrote, “Rittenhouse appears to live in a fantasy world where police and car dealerships are more endangered than unarmed Black men, and where he is a warrior.” But how much of this truly is fantasy now?

The Reality of Unrest and Violence

Recent FBI data shows 32 police officers have been killed as of July 13, largely due to the civil unrest, up 28 percent from the prior year. Hundreds more have been injured. Unarmed civilians have been attacked by rioters on the streets, in their cars, and outside their businesses, bloodied with fists, feet, and 2x4s.

As for the cost of property damage and businesses destroyed, Loretta Worters, VP of media relations for the Insurance Information Institute, said this could be one of the costliest civil disorders in U.S. history, perhaps even dwarfing the $1.4 billion in damages accrued during the 1992 Rodney King riots (adjusted for inflation).

Meanwhile, the Washington Post’s database recently showed that police shot nine unarmed black men (and one woman) last year, all of whom were reported as attempting to use some other form of potentially deadly force. In two of the instances, an officer was charged. The system is not perfect, but these numbers are still small given that police interact with about 20 percent of the nation’s 43 million Black Americans in a given year (which amounts to more than 8 million).

Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show,” asked why it was Jacob Blake who was shot and not Rittenhouse. Apparently the distinction between a man with an outstanding felony warrant, resisting arrest, overcoming a taser, wielding a knife, and reaching into a car and a young man who was attacked by a mob while offering aid and protection to others is lost on Mr. Noah. Noah’s biting commentary didn’t hold back:

Some guy decided to drive to Kenosha with his ‘militia’ buddies to protect a business and apparently ended up shooting three people and killing two. But don’t worry — the business is OK. And let me tell you something: No one drives into a city with guns because they love someone else’s business that much. No one has ever thought, ‘Oh, it’s my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.’ They do it because they’re hoping to shoot someone. That’s the only reason people like him join these gangs in the first place. And yes, I said it: a gang. Enough with this ‘militia’ b—. This isn’t the Battle of Yorktown. It’s a bunch of dudes threatening people with guns.

Riots are born on such inflammatory rhetoric, based not on facts or substance, but pure emotion. The need for civil society to defend property is anathema to the left. In an article aptly titled “In Defense of Destroying Property,” The Nation’s R.H. Lossin writes:

People are not objects; broken windows and burnt cars are simply not commensurate with the violence of state-sanctioned murder or the structural violence of poverty that has placed people of color at a disproportionate risk of dying of COVID-19. Plate-glass windows don’t bleed. They don’t die and leave loved ones grieving. They don’t contribute to the collective trauma and terror experienced by their communities. They just break, and then, at some point, they are replaced by identical sheets of glass.

In the name of “justice,” the radical left supports letting it all burn.

In the Rittenhouse case, it appears that things escalated when Joseph Rosenbaum, for reasons unknown, pursued Rittenhouse in a parking lot. Shortly before Rittenhouse fired his first shots, another weapon is seen discharging. In a split-second situation, Rittenhouse defended himself.

Shortly thereafter in videos, Rittenhouse can be seen on the ground being attacked by Anthony Huber with a skateboard. A long, hard object with wheels can be an effective weapon, as was the gun in the hand of Gaige Grosskreutz. If Rittenhouse indeed had training, as Wood suggests, then it would’ve included a key rule: never give up your weapon. In the heat of this moment, in a defensive position, Rittenhouse fired the shots that killed Huber and wounded Grosskreutz.

No one disputes that the death of people on the streets is a tragedy. But the left isn’t interested in all victims — not David Dorn, not Natalia Wallace, nor Janari Ricks. You won’t hear them say their names. You won’t see sports teams walk off the field for them, or sport football helmets memorializing them. Unlike the victims in Kenosha, they had no felony convictions and weren’t resisting arrest. They were kids with dreams. Dorn was a retired police chief about to spend his golden years with his beloved wife.

We will never know what would’ve happened if Rittenhouse had elected to withhold fire. With his weapon taken away, would the rioters have beat him like others we’ve seen in recent months? Would they have turned the weapon on him? Would we have even noticed his obituary in the paper?

Jurors will weigh the evidence. His defense team will point out that it was Kyle that was being pursued. Absent that, it appears that no one would’ve been harmed.

The voices on the left will continue to condemn Rittenhouse, regardless of what further facts emerge. They will add fuel to the fire that already burns and threatens not just Kenosha and Portland but the entire nation.

If we look deep enough, we can perhaps see the true source of their ire. When cries for justice arise only for those who fit a desired political narrative and not for children and public servants, then maybe it isn’t the loss of life that really angers them.

Portland Shooter Who Was ‘100% Antifa’ Dies In Police Shootout,"Michael Reinoehl, the shooter in the death of a conservative man in Portland who declared he was “100% Antifa,” died in a shootout with police on Thursday. Reports claim that Reinoehl fled the state and was camped out in Washington when a “federal fugitive task force” found him.

According to the U.S. Marshals’ Fugitive Apprehension Team, Reinoehl, in his vehicle, “pulled a gun on law enforcement and was shot and killed by members of the task force.”

The Post Millennial writes that Reinoehl had a rifle and that “bystanders noted hearing 40 or 50 shots, then officers returned fire.” Pierce County Sheriff’s Department and Lakewood Police Department report that four officers fired shots in the exchange.

President Trump called for the arrest of Reinoehl the same day that he was shot, asking why nothing had been done yet.

“Why aren’t the Portland Police ARRESTING the cold blooded killer of Aaron “Jay” Danielson?” he asked. “Do your job, and do it fast. Everybody knows who this thug is. No wonder Portland is going to hell!”

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1301726907298385921?s=20

Antifa members in Portland allegedly mourned Reinoehl’s death by scrawling his name on the street and blaming the police for his “execution.” There was no mention of the warrant for his arrest or that he killed someone less than a week earlier.

“Portland Police Bureau killed Michael Reinoehl,” one street writing read.

What’s disturbing to me is the message that calls Reinoehl the “best ally ever.” Not only do antifa not rebuke his murderous actions, they praise it over & over. Antifa also put up a poster nearby featuring quotes from convicted murderer & fugitive Assata Shakur. pic.twitter.com/4EdZ8fsYA5 — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) September 4, 2020

Antifa’s mourning for Reinoehl is a stark contrast to the treatment Aaron Danielson, the conservative victim of Saturday’s shooting in Portland, received. Antifa members and protestors in Portland celebrated Danielson’s death claiming that he was a “fascist” and a “Nazi.”

Before the shootout Thursday, news broke that Vice would be releasing an exclusive interview with Reinoehl, in which he claims he was acting in self-defense when he shot Danielson because he feared for his friend’s life after he became “surrounded” by a pro-Trump caravan that paraded its way through downtown Portland. He called it a “free for all.”

“I had no choice. I mean, I, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn’t going to do that,” Reinoehl claimed.

“I saw someone that is a dear and close friend of mine in the movement by himself basically confronting all these vehicles. And so I let him know that I’m here, parked my vehicle and joined up with him, found myself in the intersection in front of the food trucks surrounded by trucks and cars that had weapons,” he added.

According to Vice, Reinoehl had “gone into hiding” fearing for his life and claiming that he would not turn himself in “because he believed right-wing protesters were collaborating with police, who will not protect him or his family.”

“They’re out hunting me,” he said. “There’s nightly posts of the hunt and where they’re going to be hunting. They made a post saying the deer are going to feel lucky this year because it’s open season on Michael right now,” he said in the interview.

Reinoehl, a frequenter of Portland riots, previously claimed to be working “security” for protestors. He was also cited at other protests “on allegations of possessing a loaded gun in a public place, resisting arrest and interfering with police,” as well as “wanted on a failure to appear warrant in a June 8 speed racing case,” and “faces allegations including driving under the influence of a controlled substance, recklessly endangering another, unlawful possession of a gun and driving while suspended and uninsured.”

While Vice claimed Reinoehl is an army veteran, the New York Times said they found no record of him having ever served time.

The New York Time’s article about Reinoehl’s death, however, demonstrated clear bias. While they mention that the original shooting victim Danielson was a member of a “far-right” group, they removed Reinohel’s self-proclaimed loyalty to Antifa, a far-left group, from the same sentence.

The Left Doesn't Want To Abolish The Police. They Want To Be The Police,"The left doesn’t want to abolish the police; they want to be the police. At heart, the radicals rioting and fighting with the police are cops — every last man, woman, and alternatively gendered individual of them. The disorder they create is meant to clear the way to establish a new order, in which they will be the enforcers. They don’t want to be left alone to do their thing. They want to force the rest of us to join their thing.

This was foreshadowed in an entertaining essay from a few years ago by writer Freddie deBoer, for whom “cop” describes a personality type, as well as literal police officers. Cops, in his view, are all the petty (and not so petty) tyrants eager to order everyone else around and punish infractions — the informants and enforcers. As a man of the left, he thinks conservatives are “born cops,” but deBoer also excoriated his side:

The woke world is a world of snitches, informants, rats. Go to any space concerned with social justice and what will you find? Endless surveillance. Everybody is to be judged. Everyone is under suspicion. Everything you say is to be scoured, picked over, analyzed for any possible offense. Everyone’s a detective in the Division of Problematics, and they walk the beat 24/7. You search and search for someone Bad doing Bad Things, finding ways to indict writers and artists and ordinary people for something, anything. That movie that got popular? Give me a few hours and 800 words. I’ll get you your indictments.

This dynamic has only intensified. The internet is full of left-wing cops eager to get people harassed, fired, and otherwise canceled. Something as simple as a singer wearing the “wrong” hairstyle and bikini will set them off.

Criticizing the ill-informed opinions of millionaire athletes will bring the social justice cops down on you. A mild joke will get you suspended from your job if a leftist cop hears it and complains to the spineless management.

Leftist ‘Cops’ Are Producing Their Own Police States

As deBeor observed, the left is creating a society of rats and cops, and it was inevitable that this would move beyond speech-policing and snitching at universities and other white-collar liberal enclaves. The organized rioters and left-wing paramilitaries taking over Democratic areas is the next step in the process. They are half-serious, half-playing at revolution, but they are already acting like cops — bad cops.

When they shut down roads, block traffic, and harass drivers, they are acting as cops. When they demand people respect their authority and support them, they are cops. When they disrupt neighborhoods just for the fun of it, they are cops. When they detain people, they are cops. When they beat people down, they are cops. When they kill people and celebrate it, they are cops.

They are everything that is wrong with the worst of our current police, but with even less accountability and restraint. They are organized, persistent, and convinced they should control the rest of us. They are a self-appointed committee on public safety, making arrests and handing down sentences.

That these would-be revolutionaries have been bringing guillotines to their riots confirms their murderous intentions. Guillotines are instruments of execution, only useful against those who are already helpless. They are also the symbol of the French Revolution’s Reign of Terror, which was so labeled by its mastermind. The guillotine is useless for defense, or even for winning a civil war. Its purpose is to pacify a conquered populace through the terror instilled by summary executions of anyone suspected of being a threat to the new regime.

This brutality attracts those who want an excuse for evil. Some men will do evil for a cause they believe in; others will believe in a cause because it gives them a license to do evil. The latter sort will find plenty of work in the police states that are the natural end of radical revolutions. The revolutionaries dream of remaking the world, but because people are what is wrong with the world, they have to remake people or remove them.

From the French revolutionaries who were enraptured by the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, through Marxist regimes around the world, leftist revolutions have produced murderous police states. DeBoer got it backward. No one does cops like the left, which has all the zeal of religion and none of the humility.

We Need Order and Justice

Conservatism, in contrast, recognizes that the dividing line between good and evil runs through each human heart, thus fostering a sense of humility. The dream of a world without sin is realizable only through grace.

Order is essential for society, and providing it is the first duty of government, but the end of government extends beyond order to justice. Those tasked with providing order and administering justice, however, are imperfect. Conservatives, therefore, understand we must live and act within the tensions that exist among order, liberty, justice, and the fallibility of man.

That there is tension does not mean these are oppositional, that we must always sacrifice order for liberty, or vice versa. Conservatives recognize, for instance, that significant disorder restricts liberty, especially for the vulnerable. When the elderly can’t walk the streets safely, when women fear going out alone, when parents are afraid to let their children out of their sight, then both order and liberty have been lost. It is easier to make things worse than to make them better. Disorder can destroy liberty and justice, which may not be restored when a new order is imposed.

Thus, while we cannot do without cops, judges, and jailers, we must also restrain them lest they become a source of disorder and injustice. In this sinful world, power must check power, and all human authority must be answerable to the law. In the United States, we have therefore imposed a multitude of restrictions on the power of cops. These are, of course, imperfect, but they are much more developed and effective than those left-wing rioters and militants impose on themselves.

A revolution that makes left-wing militants and rioters into official cops is still unlikely. But police drawdowns and prosecutorial indifference are giving radicals de facto authority over the streets. In Portland, for instance, it is tacitly accepted that Republicans deserve the harassment, vandalism, and assault they are subject to by leftist enforcers.

They may not need no stinking badges, but they are police state cops to the core.

What I Saw When The Mob Attacked After Trump’s Speech In DC,"The highlight of the last night of the Republican National Convention was President Trump’s acceptance speech of his party’s nomination on the South Lawn of the White House. My wife and I attended this magical event. I say magical because the White House was lit up splendidly as nightfall fell over the sprawling verdant grounds surrounding the magnificent building.

The president was introduced by his daughter, Ivanka. Attendees endured a purposeful and loud noise from the street contiguous to the White House to the east. The hooligans making this noise did so to distract the speakers and discomfort the attendees. It went on for a very long time.

This purposeful and high-pitched, overbearing noise would never have been allowed had a Democrat been president. The mayor and the police department would never have permitted such an indignity to happen.

Beyond that, there are “nuisance laws” in every locale in this country forbidding people from taking over neighborhood streets, especially late at night, and creating explosive noises that make it impossible for the residents of the neighborhood to live a normal life. Why these nuisance laws were ignored and denied to the president and his guests was inexplicable.

After the president spoke, there were fireworks and patriotic songs. The attendees were directed to the exits. The last people I spoke to were Sen. Rand Paul and his wife. They went toward the 15th Street exit, which is on the east side of the White House, where we entered earlier that evening.

I stayed a little while longer and, by that time, the Secret Service guided us towards 17th Street, the west side of the White House. Had we gone out the east side, we would have been within a couple of hundred feet from our hotel.

As soon as we left the White House we understood that because of rioters and angry mobs we were detoured to a direction opposite, far from our hotel. Then began our harrowing night. No one from the police force seemed to know for certain what route we were to walk back to our hotel. Some had us moving further west, some further north, some further south.

No one seemed to know what to do, nor did they evince any sense of obligation to help us get back safely to our hotel. As we walked along, we encountered a police officer on the corner of this block or that and the police’s confusion and indecision seemed to grow as the night wore on.

There we were, walking past midnight in a dark town almost aimlessly because the few police we found were offering conflicting responses to our simple question: How do we get back to our hotel? This went on for more than an hour and the response from the police was, in essence, “Move on, you are on your own!” Although we did not enter the full concentration of the mob, as Paul and others did that evening, we encountered stragglers of the mob who were aggressive, swearing, and following us in a belligerent manner.

I kept asking myself: How could this be happening on the streets of a major American city? How could a law-abiding man and his wife be left to fend for themselves against vicious people intending to threaten them?

What type of mayor instructs the police department to be so indifferent to the basic safety needs of citizens and guests in her town, while focusing exclusively on the rights of mob “protesters” to rule the streets? It was as if constitutional rights are reserved for protesters against Trump but not for law-abiding citizens who are conservative.

I was astonished that the D.C. mayor allowed vicious mobs of bullies to assemble right at the gates of the White House. If more had assembled, who would have been able to stop them from crashing the gates and overpowering the few police who were there and rushing into the White House doors? If a Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris had been president, the mayor of Washington DC would have cordoned off a significant portion surrounding the White House to disallow a vicious mob from being within feet of the White House gate. No question!

This was a menacing crowd, hostile, sadistic, with the express goal of frightening good citizens, only a gesture away from violence. The “social justice” mobs are now in control of the streets of the Democrat-run cities of America — neo-brownshirts, allies of their comrades in Portland, Chicago, and New York City, looting, burning, destroying, beating up conservative Americans.

Yes, they have heard House Speaker Nancy Pelosi call us Republicans “enemies of the state.” They’ve heard Harris warn that when elected she and her administration will “go after” all who did not submit to the leftist agenda. The hoards put into action Rep. Maxine Waters’s call to “get into their faces and show them they no longer belong in public.”

The DC mayor allowed an affront to President Trump and his guests and, together with others on the left, sent a message that in their America no one can go in public wearing a MAGA hat, leave the White House peacefully if a guest of Republicans, or post a Trump-Pence sign in their yard.

After repeated failures, we got an Uber. We waited on the street corner with a man from Wisconsin who was in a similar predicament. We were far from our hotel and the driver took us in a circuitous route to reach the hotel from a back street where the rioters had not yet congregated. But we were still unable to travel the distance and the Uber driver said he could go no further. This, in America’s capital, where the people of the nation, families and invitees, should be at ease as opposed to targets fleeing a mob the city’s mayor has allowed to own the streets.

We walked towards the hotel with the intention of going through the front door. However, we heard the sound of the “community agitators” streaming toward the entrance. Luckily, we found a side alley that went into a corner door. We rushed in through the door and into the lobby.

Suddenly there was a rush of “peaceful protesters” lunging forward to crash through the doors of the hotel. At the very last minute, Rep. Vernon Jones, a black Democrat from Georgia who had spoken in support of the president, slipped through the front door with his wife. The mob was after him. Thankfully, the hotel security and police stopped the mob from entering the lobby.

It is true that when push came to shove the police surrounded those citizens whose life and body were in direct jeopardy. They did so for Paul. However, it was obvious that short of that, the police would not intervene if it would upset the mob, the new privileged in America. Forget so-called “white privilege”—in today’s Deep State America, it is the anti-Trump, anti-Republican mob that is privileged and hailed.

One thing became clear: Someone, or some group, is financing this. I saw fancy black Suburbans picking up and dropping off people involved in these protests. We were amazed that some were staying at expensive hotels and unloading equipment near the White House in what might be the city’s most expensive underground garage. They are coordinated and organized. Someone is spending money and using hi-tech reconnaissance and planning to destroy America, and using its youth as the army to do so.

It is urgent that law enforcement find out who is masterminding and financing this. It is vital that Americans realize that what is being allowed to happen in our cities is only possible because of left-wing mayors’ acceptance and comfort with it. Now is the time for law enforcement, Congress, and America’s citizens to stop this before they burn down all of America, rob us of our basic civil and human rights, and make us illegitimate strangers in our own land.

"Police Unions Protect Bad Cops, And Joe Biden Would Make It Worse","Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a zealot for empowering union officials in the private sector, once declared that “the process of collective bargaining … cannot be transplanted into the public service.” He understood that the very nature of government is undermined when a third-party organization like a union is granted the power to strong-arm elected officials over how tax dollars are allocated.

Despite the echoes of FDR’s warnings, today public-sector union officials in most states now dictate rules and employment conditions in government workplaces from police departments to hospitals, state-run liquor stores to public schools. In such settings, union officials are granted monopoly bargaining privileges, meaning control over the contracts of every employee in a public workplace—even over the objections of individual workers who oppose the union’s so-called “representation.”

The result is budget-busting profligate contracts and unfunded pension plans that have sent several states tumbling into fiscal disaster. To see the catastrophic results, look no further than Illinois’ near-junk bond rating and unfunded government-pension liabilities already exceeding $28,000 per state resident as of 2018, well before the coronavirus shutdowns’ impact.

Yet unchecked budgets and debt are hardly the only negative impact of granting special-interest union bosses this special ability to dictate public policy. Under monopoly bargaining, all employees in a workplace, from deadbeats to star performers, are treated alike under a one-size-fits-all contract.

Standard in these government union contracts are stipulations that tie wage increases to seniority rather than performance, and over-the-top protections for workers accused of wrongdoing, often no matter how egregious. This protects the worst government employees at the expense of their responsible, hard-working peers, in addition to the citizens who are paying their salaries.

Firing dangerous teachers in New York City, for example, is so difficult that there is a long history of administrators paying union members not to teach rather than firing them. One teacher accused of sexual misconduct against students was put in an infamous “rubber room” for 20 years, collecting $1.7 million from taxpayers without setting foot in a classroom. Others continue to receive payments under similar arrangements.

Of course, recent media attention has been trained on what effects union monopoly bargaining has on police misconduct and accountability in the wake of George Floyd’s death. It quickly came to light that Minneapolis police union bosses negotiated dense protections for cops accused of violent behavior, including a 48-hour waiting period before anyone could interview officers involved about reported incidents. No other citizen is afforded such a waiting period before being interviewed by police for such behavior.

You might think this would give elected officials and candidates for office pause, or at least give FDR’s warning against government unionism more consideration. Unfortunately, the opposite is true.

Among the many Big Labor power grabs in Joe Biden’s presidential platform are two bills specifically designed to expand government union control over workers, taxpayers, and government policy. Each would mandate these powers by federal fiat, even where state and local elected officials have rejected monopoly bargaining as contrary to the public interest.

One bill Biden supports (H.R. 1154/S. 1394) will federally mandate union monopoly bargaining for all police and other public safety-related government workers. The bill requires union bargaining over all aspects of employment, which includes discipline procedures for police officers and other public safety employees accused of misconduct.

If that weren’t enough, Biden has also promised to sign another bill pending in Congress (H.R. 3463/S. 1970) to require every state to grant union monopoly bargaining power over government workforces. The proposal includes mandatory binding arbitration, where unaccountable arbitrators impose a union contract on public employers, no matter how onerous to voters or their elected representatives, or burdensome to taxpayers.

What American citizens deserve is more accountability from those who run their public services, not less. And American public servants deserve the respect not to be forced into collectives where union chiefs use their government-granted powers to protect the worst in their ranks at the expense of the rest.

Rioting Continues In Democrat-Run U.S. Cities Over Labor Day Weekend,"Over 100 days of rioting and unrest continues in major U.S. cities following the death of George Floyd in May. Labor Day weekend was no exception. While some cities saw their first round of chaos this week, others suffered yet another long night of injuries, arrests, and fires.

President Trump condemned the weekend violence in a tweet calling out the “Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors” for “weakly” managing the continuing riots.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed a letter along with elected officials and members of the community on Thursday condemning the violence in Portland. Most of the letter, however, is devoted to defending those who are “peacefully protesting” and denouncing “white supremacy or vigilantism.”

“As elected officials and community leaders, we are coming together to condemn the acts of violence in Portland that have occurred as thousands of Oregonians have been peacefully protesting for racial justice and police accountability,” the letter says. “The violence must stop. There is no place for white supremacy or vigilantism in Oregon. All who perpetrate violent crimes must be held equally accountable. Together, we are committing ourselves to do the hard work that will bring meaningful change for racial justice and police reform.”

Brown t00k her opinions a step further in a written statement claiming that President Trump is encouraging and exploiting the violence for his own gain.

“For the last several years, and escalating in recent months, President Trump has encouraged division and stoked violence. It happened in Charlottesville. It happened in Kenosha. And now, unfortunately, it is happening in Portland, Oregon,” she said.

In a press conference the day after a “100% Antifa” man shot and killed a conservative man, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also took the liberty to shift blame from rioters and Antifa to focus on attacking Trump.

“Do you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence?” Wheeler said in an afternoon press conference. “It’s you who have created the hate and the division.”

Despite acknowledging that Portland “police officers have been spread too thin by three months of nightly protests for racial justice and against police violence,” Wheeler also refused federal law enforcement offered to him by Trump.

“Yet again, you said you offered to aid Portland by sending in federal law enforcement to our city. On behalf of the City of Portland: No thanks,” Wheeler wrote in an open letter that Trump shot back at on Twitter.

Seattle

A protest in Seattle “suddenly turned violent” on Labor Day after multiple “anti-police” protestors attacked officers with “rocks, bottles, explosives” and “bear spray” outside of the police union building.

According to KOMO News, 22 people were arrested but sources say that “recent restrictions on crowd control weapons leave officers with fewer options when confronting riots like the one that happened on Labor Day.”

Despite the ongoing violence lead by anti-police rioters, popular worship leader Sean Feucht says the city shut him down for trying to host a worship service in a park.

Rochester

Protests and riots began after video released of the death of Daniel Prude while in police custody back in March surfaced. According to reports, the video shows “officers holding Daniel Prude on the ground with a spit sock on his head” until he stopped breathing. Prude died a week later after being “declared brain dead at the hospital.”

Police and protestors clashed in Rochester on Friday night resulting in 11 arrests and 3 injured officers. Rioters threw objects at the officers, shot off fireworks, and set fires.

On Monday morning, a group of protestors “naked or in minimal clothes” sat outside of the city Public Safety Building wearing spit hoods in protest of Prude’s death.

Other demonstrations and protests began to turn rowdy on Monday, where Rochester Police report that bottles were thrown at officers and that a police barricade was breached.

On Tuesday, Rochester Police Chief La’Ron Singletary and the RPD command staff announced their retirement

“As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character. The events over the past week are an attempt to destroy my character and integrity. The members of the Rochester Police Department and the Greater Rochester Community know my reputation and know what I stand for. The mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for,” Singeltary stated.

Asked during a city council meeting who will be in charge during tonight’s protests, the mayor said she doesn’t know. “We would have to find an interim chief,” says Warren says. “Because I just got the call before this hearing, I don’t know. — Paul McLeod (@pdmcleod) September 8, 2020

NYC

Multiple people were arrested for rioting on Friday after causing “an estimated $100,000 in damages” to buildings on “Manhattan’s Foley Square up to 24th Street.” The group reportedly smashed windows for three hours before being arrested.

According to Fox News, one of the rioters charged with “rioting and two counts of weapons possession” spent her summer protesting in Portland.

Left: U.S. Is A Racist Hellhole Where Many More Blacks Should Live,"The lawyer who represents George Floyd’s family in Minnesota and Jacob Blake’s family in Wisconsin is renewing his claims of “black genocide” with a new client in California police shot after they say he punched a police officer and grabbed the officer’s gun.

“This legalized genocide of colored people has to stop,” lawyer Ben Crump said on a Zoom press conference last week, according to NBC4 of Los Angeles.

The wild claim of “black genocide” has been screamed all over American streets this summer during the still ongoing rioting and looting on the pretext of “racial justice.” Just last weekend in Philadelphia, “protesters” also used the word “genocide” to describe the Kenosha, Wisc. police shooting of a black man after he fought with them, threw off two Tasers, and was reaching into his car for or while carrying what turned out to be a knife.

“It’s genocide. We’re losing lives and we’re here to protest that…White supremacy is at the core of everything,” Philadelphia protester Jess Conda said, according to the local CBS News affiliate, which labeled the protests “peaceful” while noting they included a police car vandalized with spray paint. “The rally was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation,” CBS Philly reported.

In the wake of the Blake incident a few weeks ago, NBA and other highly paid sports teams boycotted games on behalf of a man police had been attempting to arrest on a warrant for sexual assault. So did tennis star Naomi Osaka, the world’s highest-paid female athlete.

“Watching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach,” she told her 1.3 million Instagram followers.

Genocide is a strong term and its victims deserve for it to remain that way, to retain its truth as a description of what they endured. The United Nations defines “genocide” as “the deliberate intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.” The accusation is that in the United States, agents of the state are systematically hunting down black people and executing them for no reason other than their skin color.

This charge is being deliberately tied to U.S. history with the implicit accusation that America always has been a genocidal country, and remains so. Protesters explicitly connect slavery and instances in which the U.S. government fought or mistreated some indigenous tribes with the rare instances of police shooting people with darker skin today.

This accusation that America has always been murderously racist is both implicit and explicit in leftist education propaganda such as Howard Zinn’s bestselling “textbook,” “A People’s History of the United States.” It is implicit in the College Board’s revised U.S. and European history courses and the entry-level college history classes they are meant to replace and reflect. And it is both openly and implicitly stated in the notorious New York Times 1619 Project.

In other words, these protesters are not making this connection out of nothing. The government “education” system the left controls has taught millions of Americans to hate their country, and some of them believe their hatred justifies violence. Thus we have protesters in the streets screaming that the disproportionately few instances in which police shoot unarmed but usually violent black people prove the United States is as racist and homicidally evil today as it was when the national government allowed states to legalize chattel slavery.

Frighteningly large numbers of Americans agree with this general view of their own country. It’s tens of millions. Earlier this year, I discussed just a few of the many polls showing this:

Today, 4 in 10 Americans who are younger than 39 disagree that the United States ‘has a history we should be proud of,’ according to a 2019 poll by FLAG/YouGov. The poll also found that half of all Americans agree the United States is a sexist and racist country, including two-thirds of millennials. Millennials showed the lowest level of agreement with the statement, ‘I’m proud to be an American.’ Thirty-eight percent of ‘younger Americans do not agree that “America has a history that we should be proud of,”’ according to the poll. 2019’s annual poll from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that 37 percent of millennials think the United States is ‘among the most unequal societies in the world.’

Polls continue to show that millions of Americans believe, against the evidence, their entire country is racist. A July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 56 percent of American voters currently agree “American society is racist.” Eighty-two percent of Democrat voters in the poll agreed “American society is racist,” as did 30 percent of Republicans.

Against this belief strong enough to generate months of riots decimating numerous minority neighborhoods, we have the curious reality that millions of the world’s “people of color” would love to immigrate into the United States. In fact, some of them die trying to do so.

Democrats want to let many, if not all, of them in. Recall that during their presidential primary debates every Democrat candidate supported open borders. To not do so opens one to the charge of racism. But if you really loved black and brown people, why would you want to get them into a country that might commit genocide, or at the very least systematically discriminates, against them?

In 2018, Gallup found that 158 million foreigners would move to the United States if they could, and most of them were from Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. If it’s hell to be black in America, why do tens of millions of Africans want to get into America? Are the millions of black and brown people who want to immigrate to the United States stupid?

Another piece of evidence contradicting the widely held view that America is a racist nation is the choice of some Americans to pretend they are members of politically favored ethnic groups when they are not. Obviously, if America were a comprehensively racist country against blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics, people like Elizabeth Warren, Rachel Dolezal, and now Jessica Krug would probably not pretend to be black and Native American.

When many more Americans were racist against our black brothers and sisters, the phenomenon of “passing” was seen as a sign of racism. Now that people are trying to “pass” the other way, is it still a sign of racism?

If the United States were a racist country committing black genocide, you would expect to see black and Hispanic Americans leaving, not trying to get in. When people are targeted for genocide, they flee. But no Americans of any ancestry are fleeing this country en masse. We are a country that has to put up walls to keep people out, unlike the nations with actual gulags that put up walls to keep people in.

Not even rich black Americans with the means to live in numerous other countries are leaving for the safety of what they imply are non-genocidal shores. No NBA players are renouncing their citizenship and moving to China, or even to Canada. NFL players could live anywhere they want in the world, and they’re staying in a country in which they claim agents of the state kill people based on a skin color that matches many of theirs. Either these people are crazy, they believe lies, or they are lying to us.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/09/the-left-the-united-states-is-a-racist-hellhole-where-many-more-black-and-brown-people-should-live/,2020-09-09
"As Shot Police Fight For Their Lives, Protesters Shout 'We Hope They Die'","After a gunman opened fire on two Los Angeles County deputies Saturday night, protesters gathered to express hate for the police outside the hospital where the two “ambushed” officers still lie with life-threatening injuries. Police say they had to clear the protesters from blocking ambulances from bringing sick people into the hospital.

Videos from reporters on the ground show the protestors yelling at the police outside of St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, California, calling cops “pigs,” screaming “f-ck the police,” and “we hope they die.”

The Los Angeles County Sheriffs pleaded with the public on Twitter to cease the protests, saying that they were “blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.”

“DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES AND EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL,” the sheriffs’ office tweeted. “People’s lives are at stake when ambulances can’t get through.”

The violation of the penal code is punishable with up to a $1,000 fine or up to one year in the county jail.

‘This is a somber reminder that this is a dangerous job, and actions, words have consequences and our jobs don’t get easier because people don’t like law enforcement,” he said.

Villanueva says the 2 deputies suffered multiple gunshot wounds and are out of surgery. One is a 31 yo mother of a 6 yo boy. Her husband is at the hospital. The other deputy is 24 years old.

"FLASHBACK: BLM Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","Two officers were shot at close range while they sat in their cruiser Saturday night in Los Angeles. The victims, who were hit multiple times and in critical condition Sunday (but are now are expected to survive) are a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman, whose six-year-old child stayed home while her husband came to her side in the hospital.

Outside, Black Lives Matter protesters blocked the emergency entrance to St. Francis Hospital, chanting “We hope they die” and “Y’all gonna die one by one.”

It was a murderous terrorist attack, within hours claimed, if not perpetrated, by Black Lives Matter. The shooter is still at large.

These two officers graduated the academy 14 months ago, before Democrat and other leftist politicians once again abandoned them to the mob. Since George Floyd died under arrest, these politicians have chanted Black Lives Matter’s anti-police lies alongside the crowds.

It wasn’t surprising it came to this. For more than half a decade, Black Lives Matter has used a nice-sounding name to shroud a terrorist agenda. “Now,” I wrote July 8, “through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.”

And in the months since, we’ve seen roads and bridges blocked, young and old attacked, and a civilian murdered — all in its name.

In a sane world, Black Lives Matter blocking entrance of a hospital to cheer for the death of a 31 year old mother of a 6 year old boy would be the end of a movement. pic.twitter.com/V4bOV3LJ0K

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, in the meantime, condemned the shooting Sunday, but still refused to name the organization behind the violence on our streets. And why would he? On Wednesday, he attacked the president for even criticizing them. Campaign staffers donated money to bail out rioters in Minneapolis, then bragged about it online. His running mate tweeted a link so her supporters could follow suit. The Democratic Party thinks they’re on its side.

July 8, The Federalist — The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/14/flashback-black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-09-14
1960s Riots Foreshadow Today's Communist Weaponization Of Black Pain,"Leaving the White House grounds recently, I knew I would encounter protestors. You could hear them throughout the evening, trying to disrupt.

Most of the protestors were to the east and north of the White House, so staff directed us to exit out the west gate. A security guard offered to accompany me and my husband south to Constitution Avenue to meet our Uber driver, and we went safely home.

We heard numerous stories the next morning of guests who had been threatened and endangered. One friend with whom we had walked out of that west gate actually decked a foul-mouthed biker. The biker had veered too close to our friend’s wife while shouting threats and obscenities, and the husband then acted as a man might reasonably be expected to — he punched the guy.

Elsewhere, dozens of angry protestors surrounded Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife Kelley as they left the White House grounds. Eventually, more police officers arrived and escorted the couple to the safety of their hotel.

Sen. Paul later reported: “After we got back to our hotel room and some safety we heard something frightening. The ‘protesters’ were staying on our floor — including the room next door to us. They were talking about their mob activities and even saying they thought we were here on this floor. We had to develop a 3 a.m. plan with the Capitol Police to get to safety.”

Paul asks, “Who are these people? Who paid for their hotel rooms? Who flew them in?” What he saw that night led him to conclude, “It’s organized. It’s paid for. It’s violent.”

Several days later, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the organization and funding of the violent protests that have wracked cities across America for months. On Sept. 10, 50 members of Congress signed a letter, calling on Attorney General William Barr to investigate the groups responsible for the ongoing attacks against our republic.

How Do Communists Start a Riot?

This calls to mind a similar moment 60 years ago. President Dwight Eisenhower had planned a state visit to Tokyo in August 1960, but a series of demonstrations and riots by Japanese communists against the visit led the president’s security team to cancel. DeWitt Wallace, founding editor-in-chief of The Reader’s Digest, asked two pivotal questions: “All the newspapers say these are communist-inspired riots. How do we know? If you’re a communist, how do you start a riot?”

Wallace’s questions ended up on the desk of a 26-year-old journalist from Georgia named Eugene Methvin. Starting his research at the Library of Congress, Methvin looked up books on riots. He could find only one — a U.S. Army field manual from 1882 that had been written in response to the 1879 C&O railroad strikes.

In 1960, there were no riots in the United States, only in foreign countries. But that quickly changed. By 1965, America’s cities were imploding. By 1968, there had been more than 150 riots or major disorders. In 1967 alone, rioting left 83 people dead and 1,800 injured.

Methvin did come across a pamphlet published by The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee entitled, “Communist Mob Violence Around the World.” It had been written by the committee’s research director, Ben Mandel. Methvin described it as “the first published study of Communist techniques of ‘riot diplomacy.’”

Mandel knew about the topic because he had been a card-carrying member of the Communist Party. Indeed, he had been the one who handed Whitaker Chambers his Communist-Party card in the 1920s. Mandel referred Methvin to Steve Posony, who had fled Austria when the Nazis took over in 1938. Posony taught history at Georgetown and advised the deputy director for intelligence in the U.S. Air Force.

With Posony and Mandel as guides and mentors, Methvin spent the next 10 years trying to answer Wallace’s questions. They are essentially the same questions we should pose today.

How To Turn Civil Unrest Into Riots

How do we know those are Marxist riots in our streets? That one’s easy: because the organizers tell us they are. In a 2015 interview, Patrice Cullors said she and Alicia Garza, co-founders of Black Lives Matter, are “trained Marxists.”

The second question is more challenging: If you are a Marxist, how do you start a riot? Or, as Methvin posed the question: “What turns an ordinarily trivial city street arrest incident into a gargantuan explosion of mass violence?” After 10 years of research, Methvin found the answer, and he published it in “The Riotmakers.”

He opens with the Newark riots of 1967, which were eerily similar to the riots following George Floyd’s death. From the windows of two public housing buildings on the evening of July 12, 1967, police were seen dragging a struggling man upstairs into the police station. Rumors quickly flew that the police had beaten and killed the prisoner.

Protests began and soon erupted into riots. Over the next four days, 26 people were killed as a result and many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. Within 10 days, riots had broken out in 43 cities across the United States.

Methvin dug deep to understand the cause. One factor he identified was the “Tractor Revolution,” the mechanization of agriculture after World War II that pushed poor blacks and whites into northern cities. While many of those poor whites were able to transition into industrial jobs, Methvin saw that blacks faced numerous obstacles such as poor education, union racism, and housing discrimination, which kept them out of the suburbs and thus out of reach of the industrial jobs.

Other factors playing a role were: the welfare policies of the 1960s, which had started to erode the black family; rampant corruption in Newark’s government, and epic overcrowding. Newark was a tinderbox. Tens of thousands of black Americans were underemployed, undereducated, alienated, exploited, and resentful.

Spontaneous or Incited?

Methvin asked: Would Newark have erupted into violence spontaneously, or did someone light a spark? He found multiple sparks.

Three years prior to the summer riots of 1967, Tom Hayden had arrived in Newark. White, bored, and unhappy, the 25-year-old from Royal Oak, Michigan was on a mission to upend the comfortable world he had been born into.

Hayden was a leader of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). He had co-authored the manifesto that lifted them out of obscurity, the 1964 Port Huron statement, which begins: “We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.”

Methvin describes the statement as “warmed-over Marxist analysis of American society, with a pinch of Lenin’s Imperialism, the Last Stage of Capitalism, and a heavy flavoring of anarchistic utopian idealism.” The statement called for a new left which “must include liberals and socialists,” and which would “start controversy across the land.”

‘We Are Actively Organizing Sedition’

What exactly was SDS’s work in Newark? While it might have been ennobled with the aspiration of rectifying the unjust and inequitable treatment of Newark’s black population, in essence, it sought to foment war. The immediate goal was revolution.

Three months before the Newark riot, Hayden took a local protégé, Jesse Allen, to Puerto Rico to meet with members of the pro-Castro “Movement for Independence.” While there, according to Methvin, Hayden denounced the Newark slum as a colonial possession of the United States. Just weeks before the Newark riot, SDS National Secretary Gregory Calvert revealed: “We are working to build a guerilla force in an urban environment. We are actively organizing sedition.”

To lead their guerilla force, SDS brought in Hassan Jeru Ahmed, a militant activist with a long criminal record who formed a battalion of “Black Beret” mercenaries and organized a campaign of agitation. Newark was flooded with anti-police propaganda and instructions for making Molotov cocktails, which included this directive: “Light rag and throw at some white person or white person’s property.”

The SDS spent three years exacerbating grievances, heightening tensions between black and white, demonizing the police and local government officials. They provided the training, the tools, and the weapons for violence. The riots that ensued, killing 26 and causing millions of dollars in damage, were in no way spontaneous.

The month after the riots had finally ended and the buildings had stopped smoldering, The New York Times Review of Books published an article by Hayden, in which he wrote:

The role of organized violence is now being carefully considered. During a riot, for instance, a conscious guerilla can participate in pulling police away from the path of people engaged in attacking stores. He can create disorder in new areas the police think are secure. He can carry the torch, if not all the people [sic], to white neighborhoods and downtown business districts. If necessary, he can successfully shoot to kill.

Communist Incitement Buried

Methven cites the numerous investigations and court cases that found similar patterns of deliberate instigation in riots across the United States: in Rochester, Cincinnati, Baltimore, San Jose, Toledo, Philadelphia, Watts, Detroit, Chicago.

Young, bored, white college students decided to conduct their revolutionary experiment using black people as the trigger.

In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, including Hayden’s well-publicized admission of SDS’s tactics and the open calls for violence by Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, appointed by President Johnson, concluded in what is known as the Kerner Report that racism was the primary cause of the riots.

Historian Sean Wilentz calls out the profound bias in that conclusion. The experts and analysts who made up the Kerner Commission were not unified in their conclusions.

Those who ultimately held sway justified the riots “not as signs of oppressive poverty and social breakdown but as righteous political protests against racist institutions, in particular the police. The events in Watts, Detroit, and elsewhere were not riots…they were rebellions; instead of seeking to quell the outrage in the nation’s inner cities, responsible government officials needed to awaken to the racism so deeply and systematically embedded in American life, and then attack it head-on.” Sound familiar?

Young, bored, white college students, seduced in their ignorance by the dysfunctional dream of Marxism, decided to conduct their revolutionary experiment using black people as the trigger. But at tremendous cost. The riots of the 1960s had a long-term negative impact on both the value of black-owned properties and on black income and employment.

Riots ‘Unambiguously’ Hurt Black People Most

Robert Margo, a professor of economics at Boston University, and William Collins, of Vanderbilt University, concluded: “the riots were unambiguously negative. They reduced incomes of African Americans’ employment, and they reduced housing values. In the case of housing values, it was broader; it actually affects overall housing values in cities, but the impact is primarily felt by African Americans.”

The Kerner Commission spent seven months looking into the cause of the riots and concluded, simply, it was racism. Methvin spent 10 years looking into the same question and came to a very different conclusion.

He fully acknowledged an array of negative factors affecting blacks in many American cities, but Methvin also demonstrated, incontestably, that the explosion of discontent into violence and rioting was not spontaneous. Indeed it was the direct result of planning and interference by white college students under the sway of Marxism.

Their meddling not only did nothing to help black people, it set many of them years back. As Margo concludes, “whatever was done afterwards was not enough to compensate for the damage and whatever economic consequences came after that.”

These Riots Are Not Random Or Spontaneous

Many of today’s leaders and mainstream media outlets would have us believe that the riots and violence sweeping across America’s cities this year are spontaneous. But history and current evidence tell us otherwise.

As Lora Ries and Charles Stimson of The Heritage Foundation pointed out in a recent report, “Video evidence and arrest records demonstrate that some rioters…have moved from city to city to cause violence using repeated tactics. Their movement and the places they go are not random. Rather, this appears to be part of an organized effort to cause chaos and destruction across the country…”

Similarly, Mike Gonzalez recently wrote in City Journal:

The protests that sprang up in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis seemed like spontaneous outpourings of grief and anger. They weren’t entirely. Though many who joined their ranks may have been moved by outrage at the images of Floyd’s death, those operating behind the scenes have prepared for this moment for a long time.

Gonzalez cites Melina Abdullah, of BLM’s Los Angeles chapter, who told an interviewer that the demonstrations in that city had been strategically planned: “We built kind of an organizing strategy that said, build black community [to] disrupt white supremacy.”

The New York Times also cites the role of Black Lives Matter: “One of the reasons there have been protests in so many places in the United States is the backing of organizations like Black Lives Matter. While the group isn’t necessarily directing each protest, it provides materials, guidance and a framework for new activists.”

Not Just Parallels, But Direct Links

Not only are there strong parallels between the riots of 2020 and the riots of the 1960s, but there is a direct link between the organizers. As Gonzalez points out, one of the three BLM founders, Patrice Cullors, spent a decade working as a radical organizer in the Labor/Community Strategy Center, which was established and run by Eric Mann, a former member of the Weather Underground.

They bombed the State Department, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California attorney general’s office, and a New York City police station.

The Weather Underground was formed in 1969 as a militant wing of the Students for a Democratic Society. They sought “the destruction of U.S. imperialism and [to] form a classless communist world.” In seeking those ends, they bombed the State Department, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California attorney general’s office, and a New York City police station.

Andrew McCarthy recently documented ties between the BLM Global Network and the Weather Underground. Kyle Shideler has also exposed the ideological roots of BLM’s obsession with white privilege, which can be traced directly to the terrorists of the Weather Underground.

As the United States now finally embarks on a serious effort to uncover whether, as Rand Paul charges, the current rioting is planned and organized, they would do well to rediscover the ground-breaking work of Methvin. He exposed the very real injustices faced by black Americans, but he also exposed the way those injustices were exploited by those who had been seduced by the lies of Marxist utopia.

Through painstaking research, Methven was able to uncover exactly how those radical organizers turned despair and frustration into violence. We can also now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that the social demolition of the revolutionaries only hurt those it aspired to help.

To Truly Help Black People, Reject BLM

Why is this all of this so vitally important? Because right now, many well-intentioned Americans believe they are helping black people by putting Black Lives Matter signs in their front yards. A number of corporations believe they are helping stamp out racism by donating millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter. Middle schools and high schools across the country are using a curriculum developed by Black Lives Matter to teach children that America is riddled with systemic racism.

But in fact, Black Lives Matter is not about helping black people. It is about using black people to achieve the co-founders’ revolutionary, ideological aims.

BLM wants to overthrow the American system of deliberative democracy and ordered liberty and replace it with their Marxist hell. The sooner Americans wake up to that reality, the less black people will suffer as a result of their current exploitation by the radical left.

Riots Erupt In Lancaster After Police Shoot Black Assailant,"Riots erupted in Lancaster, Pennsylvania Sunday after a police officer responding to a domestic disturbance call fatally shot a man charging with a deadly weapon.

Police later released the footage of the officer shooting 27-year-old Ricardo Munoz as Munoz ran screaming towards the fleeing agent who was forced to deploy a firearm in self-defense.

Protestors however, gathered outside the Lancaster police station to declare the shooting as unjust, eventually forcing police to use tear gas early Monday morning to disperse the unruly crowd that appeared to re-emerge once the first round of tear gas dissipated.

Democrats Are Complicit In The Killing Of Our Police,"It took Joe Biden three months to stand up to the insane left-wing of the Democratic Party and condemn the riots and looting that swept over America in this our summer of discontent. Even then, it was not so much a principled and courageous act but rather a political calculation. It turns out his progressive advisors were selling him a bill of goods when they told him average Americans were against America and its police, but some people were paying attention to Biden’s tacit approval of violence, and now our law enforcement officers are paying the price, some with their lives.

According to Rep. Chip Roy (R- Texas), 43 law enforcement officers have been killed thus far in 2020 — a 43 percent increase over last year. In some cases, like the horrific shooting in Los Angeles, the incidents are little short of assassination attempts.

At his rally in Henderson, Nevada on Sunday night President Trump could not have been more clear about his condemnation of that shooting. It was unequivocal. He even went so far as to call for the death penalty for the assailant. But for Joe Biden and the Democrats, well, it’s complicated.

43 law enforcement officers killed so far in 2020, up ~43 percent from the same period in 2019. 8 officers shot in the front of the head. 2 in the back of the head. 8 shot at basically point blank range. @speakerPelosi refuses to stand with law enforcement. Why is that? pic.twitter.com/psnq8CNhxJ — Rep. Chip Roy Press Office (@RepChipRoy) September 16, 2020

Biden’s Cowardly Lion act is rooted in his compromise position on the riots. In order to condemn them without singling them out, he insists that he abhors violence of all kinds. This milquetoast position is dangerous and badly misses the mark. There is not an acceptable way to equate a tragic incident involving police during the fraught and hectic process of detaining someone who is resisting arrest and a person shooting police with no provocation beyond the uniform the officers are wearing. None. To pretend so is deeply unserious and puts police officers in harm’s way.

There was once a Joe Biden who understood this, a champion of law and order, a man capable of expressing righteous anger over these assassination attempts. Either he has cynically abandoned that right and proper position for political gain, or he really is so diminished mentally that he is simply lapping up the leftist nonsense his advisers serve him like a doddering old fool slurping rice pudding at the home. Either way, it is absolutely disqualifying.

But this problem goes much deeper that Joe Biden. It is a cancer spreading throughout the Democratic Party. Nobody, it seems, in that storied institution is willing to simply say, it is never acceptable to attack police without adding a “but” to the sentence. No, “systemic racism,” whatever that means, does not complicate the targeted killing of police. The legacy of slavery does not mitigate such evil actions. The need for police reform does not give license to disobey the law or do harm to those entrusted with the protection of our society.

Is it any wonder that police are retiring at record rates? Is it any wonder that people are trepidatious about entering what should be and is one of the most honorable professions that exists in any society? As the Democrats denigrate the hundreds of thousands of brave police who risk their lives everyday to serve us, they not only undermine public safety, they put the lives of those police at risk, and we are seeing the results of that written in the blood of heroes.

Democrats insist that the problem with policing is not just a few bad apples, but rather deep and systemic. They do this with racism as well; it is never the individual responsibility of a bad actor, but rather something deeply and irrevocably broken in our horrible, racist society. It is any wonder that when the Democrats demonize all police as the racist executioners of innocent black people that there are those who see the only solution as violence?

And isn’t Joe Biden and the Democrats’ implicit threat that if we don’t let them reconstruct the entire country, the entire criminal justice system, that this violence will continue? The Democrats are offering voters two basic choices, either vote them in and let them transform America into a Marxist struggle session or the violence will continue. But this is a false choice and Americans know it.

No more equivocations, no more buts. The Democrats must denounce this spree of attacks on police in no uncertain terms, and they have to do it right now. If they do not, they will wind up with more blood on their hands than they already have, and our society will reap the violence they are sowing. That must not happen.

Study: Up To 95 Percent Of 2020 U.S. Riots Linked To Black Lives Matter,"Contrary to corporate media narratives, up to 95 percent of this summer’s riots are linked to Black Lives Matter activism, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). The data also show that nearly 6 percent — or more than 1 in 20 — of U.S. protests between May 26 and Sept. 5 involved rioting, looting, and similar violence, including 47 fatalities.

ACLED is a nonprofit organization that tracks conflict across the globe. Its U.S. project that collected the summer protest data is supported by Princeton University. The project’s spreadsheet collating tens of thousands of data points documents 12,045 incidents of U.S. civil unrest from May 26, 2020 to Sept. 5, 2020. May 26 is the day after George Floyd’s death in police custody with enough fentanyl in his system to have died of an overdose if police had never touched him.

Of the 633 incidents coded as riots, 88 percent are recorded as involving Black Lives Matter activists. Data for 51 incidents lack information about the perpetrators’ identities. BLM activists were involved in 95 percent of the riots for which there is information about the perpetrators’ affiliation.

Early estimates from insurance agencies say the cost of this summer’s rioting will set a record surpassing that of the 1992 Rodney King riots, which cost an inflation-adjusted $1.2 billion. Much of that will be paid by taxpayers in the form of overtime and hazard pay for police and EMTs, emergency room visits, destruction of public property, and more. Of course, rioters are inflicting these costs during a time governments, and the people who fund them, have fewer resources due to coronavirus shutdowns and pent-up entitlement obligations.

A look at an interactive map illustrating the data shows just how widespread the summer BLM-linked rioting has been. It has not been limited merely to anarchist strongholds such as Portland, Oregon, or locales that saw media-spotlighted violent interactions between police and suspects, but has stretched across both major and minor U.S. cities and included dozens of locales with no violent police incidents this summer.

Here are some screenshots of the map. The circle size indicates the number of riots.

According to this record, rioting occurred in the United States this summer not just in Portland, New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and other large U.S. cities, but in small and midsize cities such as Fort Collins, Co. (population 170,000), Cottonwood Heights, Utah (population 33,800), Gilbert, Ariz. (population 258,900), Wichita, Kan. (population 388,800), and Davenport, Iowa (population 382,600). Forty-seven states have seen riots this summer.

A report accompanying the data project, however, reads like an upscale attempt to blame the police for criminals’ decision to steal, kill, and destroy. Several times the report explicitly does so, such as here: “Although federal authorities were purportedly deployed to keep the peace, the move appears to have re-escalated tensions. Prior to the deployment, over 83% of demonstrations in Oregon were non-violent. Post-deployment, the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17% to over 42% (see graph below), suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest.”

This is a logical fallacy called post hoc, ergo propter hoc: Because one thing happened after another, the first thing caused the second. It’s just plain false. In science, this error is described as the difference between correlation and causation. Social scientists ought to be aware of and refrain from employing it, yet these did not.

The cause of violence is not the police. It is not poverty. It is not one’s race. To say so is in fact a smear against poor people and people of the racial group identified. The cause of violence is the people who have chosen to be violent.

Rather than assigning responsibility for violence to those who engage in it, the report constantly pushes the criminal victimization narrative that the rioters are not to blame for their rioting. This is abuser psychology 101: The abuser is never responsible for his or her abuse. The people who might object to it are. This is also false and manipulative.

The report also attempts to downplay the wave of BLM-linked violence sweeping the nation this summer, even while documenting it.

“The vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent (see map below). In more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity,” it states. “Peaceful protests are reported in over 2,400 distinct locations around the country. Violent demonstrations, meanwhile, have been limited to fewer than 220 locations — under 10% of the areas that experienced peaceful protests.”

I’m sure it is comforting to those whose businesses have been burned down and insurance won’t cover it to hear that the movement that ruined their livelihoods protests peacefully in most other cities.

When unarmed black people comprise 1.2 percent (or less) of annual police shootings, it is alleged to be a gross injustice that may legitimize, or at least excuse, murder, and theft. Yet when an activist movement is linked with riots approximately 6 percent of the time it engages in public protest, we are to see that movement as “non-violent.”

ACLED labels a 5 percent rate of police use of “force” — such as rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray, and other crowd dispersal techniques — as “heavy handed.” Thus ACLED both claims a 6 percent rate of rioting is “peaceful” and “non-violent” and that a 5 percent rate of police response to such riots is “heavy handed.”

“Over 5% of all events linked to the BLM movement have been met with force by authorities, compared to under 1% of all other demonstrations,” its report says. Elsewhere, it says: “ACLED conducted a pilot data collection program for the US last summer, allowing for comparison of the current moment with the same time period last year. In July of this year alone, ACLED records nearly 2,000 demonstrations — an increase of 42% from the 1,400 demonstrations recorded in July 2019.”

The violence is not limited to the extreme of rioting. It is pervasive in the summer 2020 protests. Of the 12,045 incidents recorded by ACLED, 1,143 — or nearly 1 in 10 — involved violence of some sort: rioting, looting, clashes with police, cars rammed into crowds, bystanders pepper-sprayed, armed attacks. Of these violent incidents, 84 percent involved BLM.

These statistics could be interpreted as indicating BLM is unusually violent among U.S. political movements, but ACLED interprets it in a way that enables resentment against police. Widespread U.S. political demonstrations such as the Tea Party, however, almost never featured violence despite holding thousands of events. Tea Partiers were even known for cleaning up the public areas where they demonstrated.

The report goes on amazingly to suggest that police standing behind barricades using tear gas and rubber bullets is a disproportionate use of force against rioting in Portland that has included the use of blinding lasers, rushes at barricades with clubs, destruction of public buildings, bomb-throwing, arson, and murder: “In some contexts, like Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon (see below), the heavy-handed police response appears to have inflamed tensions and increased the risk of violent escalation,” the ACLED report says.

Judge for yourself whether police use of force and riot-dispersal techniques often seems justified by reading the project’s summaries of some of these riots based on largely local news reports. I picked incidents from smaller cities to avoid the most sensational and nationally publicized instances, in an effort to fairly illustrate what police were responding to. The italicized material below is all quoted directly from the project. The bold is added.

On 28 May 2020, about 200-400 people demonstrated in Columbus, Ohio in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. The demonstration turned violent when businesses and the Ohio Statehouse were damaged. Some people threw water bottles, smoke bombs, and other items at police. Police used tear gas on the demonstrators.

On 28 May 2020, around 400 people held a demonstration in Albuquerque, New Mexico over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. At night, the demonstration turned violent when a group of rioters were approaching vehicles and trying to damage them. Also, several shots were fired from a car and 4 people were arrested. Another man took a baseball bat and started smashing police car’s windows. Police used gas to disperse the crowd and control the area.

On 29 May 2020, hundreds of people attended a demonstration in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against the death of George Floyd. The demonstration was initially peaceful until conflicts broke out between the demonstrators and the police. A demonstrator was pepper-sprayed twice in the face. Another demonstrator was shoved to the ground. Vandalism was reported. 29 people were arrested. Clashes continued until the next morning.

On 29 May 2020, over 1000 demonstrations [sic] were held in Des Moines, Iowa over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Police vehicles and buildings were damaged. Police used pepper spray and tear gas and made 12 arrests.

On 30 May 2020, people demonstrated in Grand Rapids (Michigan) in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Rioters smashed windows and lit fires. A non-violent demonstrator was pepper-sprayed and shot in the face with a ‘Spede-Heat’ round by a police officer.

According to many innocent victims of this wave of injustice, the police response is not robust enough. They want to know why the police are not protecting them and their property. They pay taxes. They contribute to the common good rather than attempt to destroy it. What’s the point of mayors and governors if they don’t ensure their police protect innocent people and their property when rioters come to town?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/16/study-up-to-95-percent-of-2020-u-s-riots-are-linked-to-black-lives-matter/,2020-09-16
"Tucker Carlson Guest Blames Soros, Democrats For Enabling Violence","Fox News’ Tucker Carlson slammed Minneapolis Democrats and George Soros Thursday for allowing the city’s public safety to collapse by dismantling its police department in June to appease the anarchist militia seizing the city streets in June following George Floyd’s death.

Carlson opened the evening segment reminding viewers of liberal Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender calling residents “privileged” for their worries about being raped and robbed in the absence of community law enforcement.

“Do you understand that the word dismantle our police free also makes some people nervous? For instance, what if in the middle of the night my home is broken into? Who do I call?” CNN’s Alisyn Camerota asked Bender in June.

“Yes, I mean I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors – and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege, for those of us for whom the system is working,” Bender said. “I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality.”

Carlson proceeded to air clips from a city council meeting featuring local officials asking the police they fired what the department plans to do to combat the city’s spike in violent crime. The city council unanimously voted to defund the police department in June.

“Lisa Bender was at the meeting,” Carlson said of the council’s recent session. “This week she asked the police, ‘how do we get this under control’!”

Former Army Ranger sniper Ryan Cleckner, Carlson’s guest for the segment, said Democratic mega-donor George Soros and Democratic officials created the circumstances that have allowed a Minneapolis crime wave to bloom.

“Defunding police empowers criminals,” Cleckner said. “I honestly don’t know what is worse, that they thought of the idea to defund the police or are surprised by the results… This is happening in blue states with blue governors in blue cities with blue mayors with blue DAs, many of whom, by the way, have had their campaigns funded by George Soros and other left-wing activists who just want to watch America burn.”

“You’re absolutely right. Soros did pay for a lot of this, and he’s definitely getting a return for his money,” Carlson said.

Minneapolis has just been one of many major cities nationwide suffering an epidemic crime spree. Historic animosity towards police coupled with the stripping of resources has disarmed law enforcement from meeting the challenge of keeping communities safe.

The midwestern city has also suffered recurring riots. In late August, rioters began looting again after the suicide of a male murder suspect who was being approached by police.

"In New York City, The GOP Makes A Stand For Law And Order","Staten Island is very much its own place in the universe, yet still an integral part of New York City. This urban suburb is also one of the few areas of the city where Republicans get elected. Until 2018, when Max Rose flipped the seat the 11th congressional district, which comprises Staten Island and parts of South Brooklyn, the seat was fairly reliably red. This year, popular state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis is taking on Rose in Gotham’s only swing district, and the main issue in the election is suddenly law and order.

So it was no wonder that on this past brisk Saturday morning Malliotakis held a rally to back the blue, complete with a bevy of cops in attendance ready to go knock on doors and officials from various police unions making full-throated endorsements. This year, as in other cities, gun violence has spiked in New York City and quality of life crimes are once again becoming a way of life.

The city government’s answer to all of this? Cut the New York Police Department budget by $1 billion because, as City Councilman Joe Borelli put it, there was a Twitter hashtag to defund the police.

Just as law and order has overtaken other issues in the presidential election, so too has it in our races for the House, and NY 11 is a pretty good microcosm of these purple district races. Like many GOP candidates across the nation, Malliotakis wants this issue front and center, and judging from the response of the police unions, they want that too. They want a government that has their back, as Dan Terelli, the recording secretary of the Police Benevolent Association, put it from the podium: “We always told our officers to be safe out there, now we tell them not to get arrested.”

Just like President Trump and many Republicans this year, Malliotakis has scooped up all the police union endorsements, not a small thing in a district known as the home of cops and fireman. It’s where the home of the police chief in “Blue Bloods” is set. But Rose has previously successfully presented himself as a moderate Democrat, a war veteran who even runs a comical ad in which he calls his own party’s Bill de Blasio the worst mayor in history. But on the law and order issue, he has a slight problem.

Back in June, when such was all the rage, Rose partook in a protest march in which demands to defund the NYPD were made and signs saying “Blue Lives Murder” were carried. Sergeants Benevolent Association Ed Mullins criticized the move at the time, saying, “Why is Max Rose indicting every cop in the country right now?”

Rose’s response back in June: “I never thought I’d see the day when the head of the SBA would become a snowflake who needs a safe space.” Given the skyrocketing attacks on police, including assassination attempts since then, Rose might want to rethink that answer.

I guess you could argue that at least he didn’t urge his Twitter followers to bail arsonists out of jail, like Sen. Kamala Harris did, but insulting cops, while maybe a good look back in June, could prove to be an Achilles heel now for Democrats all over the country. “You can’t march with the defund the police crowd and get reelected in this congressional district,” Malliotakis told supporters at the rally. That remains to be seen, but is clearly the approach that she and many Democrats are taking as we edge closer to Nov. 3.

NY11 will tell us a lot about where the country and in particular the Democratic Party is these days. Rose, like Biden, is hoping that a quick pivot back to purporting to support the police will be enough to persuade voters that he is a moderate, not a Staten Island Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That has always been his mission, in fact. It’s hard to believe that marching with anti-police protestors helps with that very much, and it is very unlikely to be forgotten.

This is an important stand for Republicans in New York City, who at present have no representation in Washington DC, but it is also a bellwether for the nation. As the Democratic Party lurches to the left, can self-proclaimed moderates like Rose really convince voters that they are a stabilizing force in the party, not a rubber stamp for leftist craziness? The answer to that question may very well decide the balance of power in the House of Representatives next year.

What U.S. Police Can Learn From Iraq About Policing A Troubled Town,"“If men were angels, no government would be necessary.”

James Madison, Federalist No. 51

According to Thomas Hobbes, government exists to stave off endless bloodshed and chaos and to protect commerce. Hobbes eloquently described a world without government — in his 1651 work “Leviathan” — as being akin to “a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man…wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength…shall furnish them withall.”

In this condition, which Hobbes termed the “state of nature,” there is no industry or commerce “because the fruit thereof is uncertain,” there are no arts and letters, and “worst of all, [there is] continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”

The remedy to this chaos, for Hobbes, was the social contract; individuals were to give up their right to carry out violence against their neighbors to Leviathan — an absolute sovereign.

Hobbes preferred that this sovereign be a king, but also believed an assembly could fulfill this role. This Leviathan would have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force and use the threat of the use of such force to keep the violent and anarchic state of nature at bay. If the Leviathan failed to protect its citizens from this anarchy, they had the right to rebel.

In his 1690 work “Second Treatise of Government,” John Locke largely agreed with Hobbes concerning the state of nature and the social contract, yet he argued that the government (which he thought should include parliament in addition to a king) owed the people more than protection — it was required to secure their natural rights to life, liberty, and property.

Like Hobbes, Locke maintained rebellion was acceptable when a government failed to protect its citizens. He added, however, that citizens also had a right to rebel if the government failed to secure their natural rights. These ideas eventually made their way into the closest thing the United States has to a creed, the Declaration of Independence.

Today, the police are the arm of government that has been given a monopoly on coercion (violence) to keep the state of nature at bay. Yet our police forces need to secure the natural rights of man while preserving the consent of those over whom they have power. Before we discuss the consent of the governed further, it is necessary to first argue why police forces should not be abolished.

Modern Examples of the State of Nature

Despite what many today say about the so-called inherent goodness of man, history has proven the state of nature to be a very real danger. When the rule of law breaks down and the state no longer has a monopoly on violence, every person becomes a law to him- or herself. He is free to use force however he sees fit without fear of government reprisal. As a result of this excessive liberty, anarchy reigns until a new government asserts itself (whether a legitimate government, an authoritarian regime, or organized crime). This is what happened in Mexico at the turn of the century.

According to Ioan Grillo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost its iron grip on the Mexican state around the year 2000. The PRI stepped aside and allowed Mexico to transition to democratic rule. One would think this a positive development, but this was not the case.

While the PRI had been undemocratic and prone to human rights abuses, one thing they did well was control organized crime. The PRI was able to consolidate state power at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure its supremacy over criminal organizations and to guarantee its monopoly on violence.

Under PRI rule, the cartel capos ran their fiefdoms with the permission of the Mexican state. They were allowed to use low levels of violence against, say, other criminals, but they were not allowed to kill civilians en masse, nor were they allowed to extort the public at large. If the capos violated these rules, the state eliminated them.

This hierarchy was broken, however, when the PRI fell from power. In the new democratic Mexico, federal, state, and local power was divided amongst parties. A power vacuum resulted. The state of nature abhors a vacuum.

Cartels competed with the state for territory, the right to tax, and the violence monopoly. The result was a breakdown of the rule of law and a partial descent into the state of nature — complete with mass graves, rape, torture, beheadings, and hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Mexico isn’t alone. The World Justice Project compiles a Rule of Law Index every year that measures to what extent states are able to enforce the laws across their territory. Unsurprisingly, those with some of the worst scores on this index — like Afghanistan, Mexico, and Venezuela — also have some of the highest violence rates in the world. We can therefore clearly observe that if effective law enforcement is absent, societies do in fact become more violent.

Some might still maintain that a coercive police force is not necessary to enforce the rule of law. We could, they argue, enforce the rule of law through communal norms, social pressure, restorative justice, “peace councils,” and social workers. These people believe that if we have enough social programs and educational initiatives we can truly create a world that is free from violence.

While there are certainly many things we could do to lower the levels of violence in our society and reduce the scope of police duties, to think we can eliminate the police altogether is utopian and naive. Illicit violence is actuated by greed, selfishness, and passion. Humans are greedy, selfish, and passionate beings.

As long as humans are humans, they will continue to commit violence against each other, and police will be needed to stop that violence. If there are no police, other groups will rise to fill the power vacuum and provide protection (which is what happened in Seattle’s CHAZ).

The Wrong Debate

While much of the police debate in this country has centered around what officers and alleged perpetrators have done in specific incidents, the debate should be about the consent of the governed insisted upon in America’s Declaration.

For instance, one side ardently believes Jacob Blake is an innocent man ruthlessly gunned down by police. The other side believes him to be a perpetrator of sexual assault who was justifiably gunned down by police because they prevented him from stealing a car and taking his children along for a high-speed chase.

While a court of law should uncover the truth, the debate over whether this shooting was justified distracts from the heart of the issue: many police departments across this nation appear to have lost the consent of the governed. Restoring this consent is the key to police reform in the United States. Perhaps surprising to some, we can look to U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq to discover a solution to this problem.

Counterinsurgency Strategy and Police Reform

An outside force or force of occupation will almost always lack the consent of the governed, and therefore, legitimacy. One key way to secure the consent of the governed is to let the governed provide their own security. During their time in Iraq, U.S. forces learned this lesson the hard way.

The Sunni insurgency began in Iraq a matter of months after the dust settled from the initial U.S. invasion. In his memoir detailing his three tours of duty in Iraq, “Iraq Full Circle,” Col. Darron Wright (now deceased) argues one of the main causes of the Sunni insurgency was that the heavy-handed tactics of U.S. forces alienated the population and drove them to armed conflict.

Wright recounts how, when his soldiers were attacked by a few al-Qaida operatives, his forces would demolish homes, arrest tribal leaders, and cordon and search entire towns. These tactics were successful in decreasing the number of attacks his unit faced, but they had disastrous long-term effects. “For every insurgent we killed or captured indirectly,” says Wright, “we were recruiting three more.” “Most importantly,” he notes, “we were losing the population.”

According to Gen. David Petraeus (Ret.), the turn-around in Iraq occurred after U.S. forces reconciled with Sunni Muslims — whom they had previously fought — and began paying them to fight al-Qaida. This movement, known as the Sunni Awakening, began organically in Anbar Province in 2006 when a U.S. Army unit decided to support local leaders who wanted to push back against al-Qaida.

The initiative spread like wildfire throughout Iraq and came to be known as the Sons of Iraq program. Instead of antagonizing Sunni Muslims as U.S. forces fought al-Qaida, U.S. forces paid about 100,000 Iraqis about $300 per month to fight al-Qaida and provide security for their own villages. The Sons of Iraq program was a crucial aspect of the strategy that ultimately defeated the Iraqi insurgency (and make no mistake, this insurgency was defeated), and we can apply key lessons from this success story to police reform in the United States.

Learning from Iraq

First, we must admit that while many police departments across the country have effectively secured the consent of the governed, some departments are viewed by local communities as armies of occupation. The focus of reform should therefore be on reconciling these departments with local populations to restore the consent of the governed.

The first lesson we can learn from the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq is that heavy-handed tactics may provide a safer environment in the short run, but they will lead to more “insurgents” in the future.

To be sure, Broken Windows policing and stop-and-frisk policies are not anywhere near the level of demolishing terrorist homes, and they may initially be effective at lowering crime. Ultimately, however, they alienate the population and slowly erode the consent of the governed.

Broken Windows policing, in which police officers issue a multitude of citations for low-level offenses in hope of preventing larger crimes, often damages the relationship between citizens and police. Dr. Brett Stoudt of the John Jay School of Criminal Justice shows it causes citizens — especially minority citizens — to distrust and fear the police.

Stop-and-frisk policies have a similar effect. These policies have been carried out in a manner that violates citizens’ constitutional rights while harming the relationship between police and local communities. A police force that is feared, mistrusted, and has a bad relationship with its citizens is in danger of losing the consent of the governed.

Therefore, policing strategies should aim to empower local communities to police themselves just like the Sons of Iraq program empowered Iraqis to provide security for themselves. The question then is how to apply the Sons of Iraq strategy to American cities.

To answer this question, remember that through the Sons of Iraq program, the U.S. government effectively paid and armed insurgents who had American blood on their hands. Without this reconciliation, there would have been no Sons of Iraq program, and thus, no victory in Iraq for American forces. Applying this strategy to policing in America will require a similar reconciliation, and this will require a major change in how some police departments recruit officers.

A Chance for Redemption and Service

It is currently nearly impossible to become a police officer in America if you have a criminal record, or if you have simply smoked marijuana more than a few times. These standards are ludicrous. First, they disqualify a multitude of people from being law enforcement officers solely because they grew up in a rough neighborhood and made mistakes as teenagers. Second, they leave no room for redemption in people’s lives. Third, they result in many communities being policed by outsiders.

If the U.S. Army was willing to arm and pay people who formerly attacked them, American police forces should be willing to hire people who have past criminal conduct but have shown they have reformed. Why should an American who has done his time in prison not be able to help police his hometown if he has subsequently reformed, proven through years of good behavior and positive community involvement? This officer would have immense power to build relationships with young people in the community with an increased ability to cultivate respect and legitimacy.

Our current system leaves no room for such redemption, and this is why the rule of law in so many communities is enforced by outsiders who do not have the consent of the governed. Reconciliation and empowerment is a surefire way to resecure the consent of the governed and end the policing crisis in many American communities.

Democratic Georgia Senate Candidate Compares Police To Gangsters And Thugs,"While Democrats ramp up their anti-police rhetoric to appease its radical base and demand the abolition of community law enforcement, the leading Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia running to unseat incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler already has a history of making disparaging remarks against agents of public safety.

During a March 2015 sermon, Democrat American Pastor Raphael Warnock called police officers “gangsters and thugs.”

“So in Ferguson, police power showing up in a kind of gangster and thug mentality – you know you can wear all kinds of colors and be a thug. You can sometimes wear the colors of the state and behave like a thug,” Warnock said.

Warnock made similar comments in November the same year, calling police officers “bullies.”

“When you think about the fact that America still warehouses 25 percent of the world’s prisoners, we shouldn’t be surprised when we see police officers act like bullies on the street,” Warnock said.

Watch Fox News’ Tucker Carlson cover Warnock’s comments here:

Seattle City Council Overrules Mayor To Pass Bill In Support Of Defunding The Police,"After massive public pressure from individuals and organizations, the Seattle City Council overruled a series of vetoes from Mayor Jenny Durkan, and will proceed with passing bills to defund the Seattle police department. The bills will reduce the police force by 100 officers, cut wages of police commanders, and redirect millions of dollars to other public programs.

“Countless videos of Black and brown lives lost here in Seattle and across the country shows us that not everyone feels safe in our community, and not everyone is safe,” Council President M. Lorena González said. “We need public safety that’s centered on harm reduction, not the status quo.”

Durkan first vetoed the city’s revised 2020 budget at the end of August claiming it provided no solutions or plans for how to make up for the loss of a significant number of police officers and offered skepticism over the million-dollar loan that she’s “not sure we can repay.”

“While the council may not be concerned about the details, I am. And they actually do matter,” Durkan said after vetoing the proposal.

Using their two-thirds majority ability to overrule Durkan, however, the City Council passed the series of bills, defending them as a “reasonable” way to transform public safety in Seattle.

Former Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best, the first black police chief in Seattle, announced her resignation in August due to the City Council’s proposed cuts claiming that they were unreasonable and impractical for furthering police reform.

“I believe 100% that they were putting me in a position destined to fail. Cutting a police department that already had low staffing numbers, that was already struggling to keep up with the demand,” Best told NPR. “How are we going to provide for adequate public safety in that environment?”

According to local news reports, a “substitute” proposal was introduced which would have prevented police layoffs as well as addressed the budget concerns of the mayor, but City Council members ultimately “thought the substitute proposal conceded too much” and said “they hoped to work better with the mayor on next year’s budget.”

Durkan expressed similar sentiments about continuing reform by working together, even agreeing with the Council that “the city’s 911 call center and its parking enforcement unit should be moved outside the Police Department.”

“One of our shared responsibilities is to find common ground,” said Durkan. “Even when we disagree, I have always believed we could work together on actual solutions that can be done and make the change we want to see.”

While the Council originally promised to cut the police budget in half the new budget, the newest proposals actively seek to “reduce the police force” and shift the focus to community and public-based initiatives. The Council described the initial cut as a “down payment” on future budget trims.

One of the most recent community and public-based initiatives was the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone created by protestors, rioters, and anarchists as a way to provide a police-free zone. Members of the zone became violent with “multiple instances of assaults, rape, robbery, shootings,” and prevented emergency responders from entering the area to provide aid to the teenage victims of shootings.

Seattle was one of the three cities named on the Department of Justice’s “Jurisdictions Permitting Violence And Destruction Of Property” list, citing the city’s mishandling of violence that ensued from CHOP, as well as the Seattle City Council, Mayor Durkan, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s refusal to accept federal law enforcement assistance to mitigate that violence.

Riots Erupt In Denver Over Grand Jury Verdict In Breonna Taylor’s Case,"DENVER — Riots erupted in Denver Wednesday night over the afternoon grand jury verdict in 26-year-old Breonna Taylor’s case because jurors thought the evidence merited bringing Officer Brett Hankison to trial on first-degree “wanton endangerment.”

Rioters were demanding murder charges for officers who shot Taylor while executing a no-knock drug raid on her home. During the raid, according to grand jury testimony, a male inhabitant standing next to her shot police after they announced themselves, got no response, and then opened the door, upon which officers returned fire, hitting Taylor.

Hundreds flocked to the Colorado Capitol building in the early evening to hear speeches. They proceeded to take over the street on the west end of the capital grounds, chanting “Breonna Taylor.”

Things quickly escalated after 9 p.m., when most of the protestors went home, while a slimmer but sizable crowd of about 100 stayed behind and still demanded control of the streets. Moments later, one man drove his car down the block protestors were occupying. They surrounded the car and ordered the individual to turn around.

After several minutes of tense back-and-forth, the driver gave up and plowed through the unrelenting crowd anyway.

Demonstrators then began a march to the Denver police about three blocks west of the capitol building where protestors harassed police through the gates and re-positioned dumpsters to serve as protective barriers.

“I need that, I need that for things,” said a man who can be heard in the background who worked in the building next-door where the dumpster was taken.

Several other major cities across the nation suffered a repeat outbreak of civil unrest in the aftermath of Taylor’s verdict, including Louisville, where the March shooting occurred. The Louisville Police Department reported that two of its officers had been shot amid the anarchic chaos.

Interim Louisville Chief of Police Robert Schroeder told reporters both officers are “stable.”

Two Officers Shot In Riots After Grand Jury's Breonna Taylor Decision,"Two Louisville Metro Police officers were shot on Wednesday night as riots erupted around Louisville in wake of a grand jury’s decision announced Wednesday afternoon in the Breonna Taylor case.

Police killed Taylor by returning fire when a man she was standing next to shot at officers as they opened her apartment door while executing a drug raid. Taylor is black, which rioters claim means her death was racially motivated despite a lack of evidence for that claim.

The Interim Louisville Chief of Police Robert Schroeder announced both officers are “stable” and a suspect was arrested, but that he is “very concerned about the safety of our officers.”

According to Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a grand jury indicted one of the three officers in the shooting, Brett Hankison, with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment after he “fired through a window into [Taylor’s] apartment the night she was killed.”

Mayor of Louisville Greg Fischer issued two executive orders on Tuesday in anticipation of the announcement and the violence that might follow. One was a “state of emergency due to the potential for civil unrest, which allows him to exercise any of his emergency powers, including those to hire or contract for services, and implementing curfews and other restrictions” and another which “restricts access to five downtown parking garages and bans on-street parking in order to provide an extra layer of security for protests in and around Jefferson Square Park.”

He also issued a curfew for Jefferson County starting at 9 p.m. every night and going until to 6:30 a.m. for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. These curfews, however, were lost on rioters, who smashed windows, threw projectiles at officers, and set fires at Louisville’s Hall of Justice in downtown.

Justice For Breonna Taylor Isn’t Indicting Cops For Acting In Self-Defense,"After Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced that a grand jury declined to file charges against the police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor, civil unrest broke out in the streets. Two police officers were shot and miraculously survived.

Many felt that the single indictment of Detective Brett Hankison — which was based on charges related to endangering Taylor’s neighbors, not charges linked to Taylor’s death — fell short of justice.

“NOTHING for the murder of Breonna Taylor,” Ben Crump, attorney for the Taylor family, said shortly after Cameron’s announcement. “This is outrageous and offensive! If Brett Hankison’s behavior was wanton endangerment to people in neighboring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor’s apartment too. In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder!”

The emotional outrage surrounding Taylor’s death is understandable. The 26-year-old emergency room technician should not have died at the hands of police, an incident that possibly could have been avoided if the police had more clearly identified themselves. The blame shouldn’t fall on the grand jury’s decision not to charge the three officers with Taylor’s death, however. The two officers were justified in firing their weapons because Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired one shot at them first. Because of that fact, the officers were acting in self-defense.

“When we all got up in line, I knocked on the door,” Sgt. Jon Mattingly told investigators, according to the New York Times. “Our intent was to give her plenty of time to come to the door because we said she was probably there alone,” he said. “Banged. No response. Banged on it again. No response. At that point we started announcing ourself, ‘Police, please come to the door!’”

Prior to yesterday, it was widely reported that the police officers didn’t announce themselves before barging into Taylor’s home. Cameron said yesterday, however, that police did knock and announce themselves before coming in, which a civilian witness corroborated. It’s worth noting, however, that it wasn’t until 12:35 a.m. on March 13 when officers began their raid.

Nevertheless, Taylor’s boyfriend, Walker, maintains neither of them could hear who was at the door. When it’s past midnight, and a person wakes up frazzled with someone banging at his or her door, it’s reasonable to grab a legally-owned gun.

Walker told police he assumed the person at the door was Taylor’s ex-boyfriend, who was at the center of the criminal drug case. When police entered, Walker said he fired to protect his girlfriend, and the police fatally shot back.

Much of the blame and justification for civil unrest is falling on the police officers and the life-and-death decisions they made in that moment. The assumption, it seems, is that unless the officers are charged with murdering Taylor, there is no justice.

However, instead of blaming the police officers for acting in self-defense, a better question surrounds law enforcement’s decision to raid her home in the first place — especially with a no-knock warrant so late at night. Yes, the investigation found the police did knock and announce themselves, but when people are half-asleep inside, the margin for error or a fatal misunderstanding is high.

Another important question to ask is why the police weren’t wearing body cameras that night. In 2020, that is inexcusable.

In June, two months after her death, the Louisville City Council voted unanimously to enact Breonna’s Law, which bans no-knock warrants, requires police to wear body cameras when serving warrants, and mandates that they activate the cameras five minutes before starting an operation. On the same day, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced similar legislation at the federal level.

Last week, Louisville city officials agreed to pay Taylor’s family $12 million and committed to instituting police reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. Among the changes is a requirement that commanding officers review and give written approval for all search warrants, and an agreement to “overhaul how simultaneous search warrants are conducted.”

This is all good. No-knock warrants can be a life-saving tactic for cops in the fight against drug traffickers, kidnappers, and other criminal offenders, but they’re not a more valuable tool than Taylor’s life.

The fact that Taylor’s family received $12 million and a commitment to institute reforms to prevent future botched police raids is, sadly, as much justice as Louisville city officials can offer her grieving family. Despite what some protesters and rioters maintain, justice is not indicting officers for defending themselves.

If protesters aren’t satisfied with the legal outcome, where do we go from here? If instituting change in Breonna Taylor’s name isn’t enough to quell unrest in Louisville, what will?

As Cameron said yesterday, “Criminal justice isn’t the quest for revenge. It’s the quest for truth.”

The Democrats’ Leftward Lurch Is Sinking Joe Biden In Florida,"MIAMI, Fla. — Democrats are facing a problem in Florida.

In a must-win battleground with 29 electoral votes up for grabs, the critical swing state President Trump flipped by a razor-thin margin four years ago has remained the epicenter of the southern campaigns. California Sen. Kamala Harris made Florida her first stop as Joe Biden’s running mate, and Trump came to the state twice last month. Ivanka Trump visited as well. Biden even made an appearance in Florida, marking one of the few rare occasions the 77-year-old didn’t call a morning “lid” canceling that day’s campaign schedule.

There’s no path to the White House for Trump without Florida. The president can hold on to two of the three Midwestern “blue wall” battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, but would still lose the White House without the Sunshine State.

However, recent polling suggests that Democrats are having a tough time in this key southern state, where an unexpected group of voters is fleeing the Democratic Party. Hispanics, a once-reliable voting bloc for Democrats, appear to be breaking for Trump in growing numbers. Trump is expected to capture 36 percent of the Hispanic vote in November, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll conducted shortly after the party conventions. While that’s far from a majority, it’s also far higher than the president’s overperformance among this group in 2016, when the president took 29 percent of the Hispanic vote. That was better than Mitt Romney’s 27 percent in 2012 but short of John McCain’s 31 percent in 2008.

Zoom into Florida today, though, and Trump is winning among Hispanic voters 50 percent to Biden’s 46 percent, according to a recent NBC/Marist survey out last month.

An even closer look at Miami-Dade County shows where the problem lies. A Democratic stronghold carried by Hillary Clinton by 30 points in 2016, Biden leads there by 17 just percent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 70 percent of the county is Hispanic.

There’s a reason former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg just rolled out a $40 million ad blitz to run in all 10 media markets of the Sunshine State this week, nearly half of the $100 million the former presidential candidate and New York mayor has pledged to spend on Biden’s behalf. It’s because Biden is losing.

While there’s a litany of reasons Democrats’ grip on Florida’s Hispanic voters appears to be slipping, it’s the Democratic Party’s lurch to the left that’s mostly to blame.

Horrors of Socialism Fresh Among Florida Hispanics

While the first post-revolutionary wave of Cuban migrants to the United States came several decades ago, memories of the atrocities under Fidel Castro’s communist regime remain fresh in the minds of Cuban emigres and their descendants in South Florida.

Now, some Cuban-Americans are experiencing a moment of deja vu, seeing the Democratic Party enthusiastically embrace similar socialist rhetoric and policies faithfully implemented in the very society they fled.

Irena Vilarino, a small business owner whose family owns a dozen Miami-area restaurants, is one of them. Vilarino came to the states when she was four years old, and her family first settled in West Palm Beach in 1980. The family started out selling fruit and eventually worked their way up, like many other new immigrants, purchasing their own restaurant four years later.

Today, Vilarino operates several Miami establishments with her siblings and ran for the Republican nomination in Florida’s 26th congressional district this year. Vilarino says the president who has categorically condemned the communist regimes raging across Latin America and re-introduced sanctions on Cuba has successfully tapped into the South Florida experience. His message powerfully resonates among the region’s Hispanic voters.

“When you see yourself forced to emigrate, you never lose that sense of loss,” Vilarino told me over lunch in one of her restaurants as she teared up. “You carry that with you forever… It’s a little indescribable… This is my home, but you always feel that sense of displacement.”

It’s not just Cuban-Americans who are anxious over the Democratic Party’s embrace of socialism, with promises of taxpayer-provided health care and a radical expansion of the welfare state while enthusiastically endorsing draconian lockdowns in the name of public safety. The situation in some Latin American countries has only worsened over the last decade. The decline of socialist Venezuela, for example, has become perhaps irreversible, with consequences rippling across the region.

That’s a key distinction between McCain’s support and Trump’s, Vilarino said. A recent second wave of socialist devastation under authoritarian regimes is re-traumatizing Latin American voters, many of whom see the Democratic Party using the same rhetoric deployed in their home countries.

“What happens with leftist regimes is they normalize what is not normal,” Vilarino said. “They normalize cheating, they normalize lying, they normalize stealing, they normalize envy, they normalize division.”

Black Lives Matter, But Do Hispanic Lives?

The Democratic Party has in large part become an extension of the Black Lives Matter movement, for which Biden has promised to be a vehicle. That’s a problem for many of Florida’s Hispanic voters, Miami-area Republican strategist Dave Reaboi tells me. The left’s obsession with identity politics is driving division, pushing away Hispanics who see themselves more as Cuban-Americans or Colombian-Americans, or even just Americans.

“Some Hispanics may see the Democrats’ explicit appeals to racial tribalism as alienating, necessarily pitting Hispanics against African-Americans,” Reaboi said.

The left-wing woketopians now running the Democratic Party are running on the logic that all minorities are against the white “cis” majority, victims of wealthy oppression in a systemically racist society, when in fact many Hispanic voters have become very successful within a generation or two of arriving in the United States, embodying the American dream.

Through their blanket demands for reparations and the destruction of free enterprise, the Black Lives Matter movement has tried to include Hispanics in its narrative that the United States was founded on slavery and oppression, even though many Hispanics have arrived in the United States long past slavery and even Jim Crow, and have had a very different experience than black Americans.

Hispanics in South Florida, who have risen from abject poverty to prosperity, have also actually lived through real oppression.

Attacking Law Enforcement Means Attacking Hispanics

More than half of the sworn officers serving in the Miami Police Department are Hispanic, according to the latest public data. That means every time a police officer gets attacked, there’s a good chance the victim is either Hispanic or possesses a significant personal connection with the Hispanic community.

The left’s glorification of thuggery, amplifying historic animosity towards police in the name of social justice, has only further alienated Hispanic voters. John Cardillo, a law enforcement analyst with strong ties to the south Florida law enforcement community and a former police officer, began his career with the Miami Police Department. Cardillo said he’d be hard-pressed to find an institution more integrated with the community then the police. He says he saw more interracial marriages among police than anywhere else, tying the Hispanic population that much closer to local law enforcement.

So when “Democrats [are] refusing to acknowledge that Antifa is a real thing,” Cardillo said, referencing the domestic terrorist group targeting police, it only pushes Hispanics away.

Latinx Is ‘An Absolute Insult’

An August study from the Pew Research Center shows just one in four Hispanics has ever heard of the term “Latinx,” the politically correct alternative to “Hispanic” or “Latino.” Further, only 3 percent use it.

But the absence of the phrase’s use among Hispanics hasn’t stopped Democrats and their allies in the media from imposing the term on them. Biden uses it, NPR uses it, BuzzFeed uses it, Vox uses it.

It’s the type of passive pointless progressivism that infantilizes Hispanic voters, and it’s increasingly common in the Democratic Party. Cardillo says it only frustrates Hispanic voters, who see it as self-serving rhetoric from condescending politicians.

“I think it’s an absolute insult,” 28-year-old Anthuan Rubbio told me in the parking lot of a local brewery. “It’s ridiculous. It’s Latina, Latino, Latinas, Latinos. Like, that’s what it is.”

Rubbio said he’s frustrated with the victimhood mindset the left has imposed on Hispanics consistent with the soft bigotry of low expectations, a common grievance among south Florida Hispanics. Cardillo emphasized that’s partly why Trump has resonated with Hispanic voters. The president speaks to them as equals, he says, not a group that requires special assistance.

“No Latin wants an X next to their name, it just sounds dirty,” Vilarino said with a chuckle before making a serious point about the message it sends when Democrats lump Hispanics together as a special-needs group:

This is one of the things that you lose. You lose your identity. For instance, a person from New York is very different than a person from Texas, right? Yet, they’re both American, right? But they’re different cultures. So a person from Mexico is very different than a Cuban, which is very different from a Colombian, who is very different from an Argentine. And yet here we’re all lumped together. But it’s bad enough that we’re lumped together, you know? And the good thing about that, you know, here, we become one as a culture. As a Hispanic, Latin culture. But now they want to put an X next to our name. We don’t want it. Tell them to save it.

Democrats are on track to lose the Hispanic vote in Florida and therefore the state, pending no change in the party’s anti-police platform and proposals to form the same society many Hispanics and their families have just fled.

A Riot In The Suburbs: Inside The Changing Face Of Wisconsin 2020,"WAUWATOSA, Wis.—Dale Kooyenga is emblematic of how the new populist, working-class shifts in the Republican Party can cut both ways. Trim and handsome at 41 years old and the father of four children, he’s the sort any local political party would want to run: a former college basketball player, an Iraq War veteran, and a major in the Army Reserves. Yet in the once button-downed, middle class, solidly Republican stretch of suburbs and farm country bordering Milwaukee, two things have shifted — and with them, the political fortunes of the local GOP.

First, a growing influx of liberals from the solidly blue city have changed the electorate; second, President Donald Trump of Queens, New York, has changed the party. While Trump’s brash, impulsive and no-bull style reverberates with disaffected union Democrats and other working-class types, those mannerisms aren’t such a hit among the married, Christian, college-educated suburban women that Wisconsin Republicans like former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan could once reliably count on.

“Absolutely, [the top of the ticket] is hurting us here in this part of the WOW counties,” Kooyenga tells us, using a common state acronym for Milwaukee’s three suburban counties. “I think it’s hurting us, but it’s helping us in [rest of the] state so everything that we’ve lost in the WOW counties we’ve picked up with the other people who liked the new brand and the outcomes.”

In a county he won comfortably for years as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Kooyenga’s 2018 state Senate race was a close call, besting his Democratic opponent by just 2.4 points. In all likelihood, his 2022 political fortunes come down two things: if Trump is still in the White House, and if 2020’s redistricting moves him further east into the city, or in any other direction — where his style of Republican politician still resonates.

The question is, does that trade-off with the suburbs keep Wisconsin in play nationally? While he’s focused on his district, Kooyenga thinks so: “Yeah—it’s a margin of error.”

Nothing is quite normal in Wisconsin right now, though. Thursday morning had been an unusual one for Kooyenga, too: Downtown, he’d been meeting with business owners who’d just been the victims of a riot.

We’d taken the express ferry from Michigan to Milwaukee Wednesday afternoon—a quick two-and-a-half hours hurling across open water at about 35 knots — disembarking south of downtown just as a Black Lives Matter mob was pouring onto I-94 a short ways up the highway.

“You might not want to park on the street,” the young valet at the door warned us. “I’m not sure which way they’ll go after police disperse them.” The young concierge upstairs echoed the sentiment.

The protest was in response to news that the Milwaukee County District Attorney Office would not be criminally indicting a police officer in Wauwatosa, a suburb just west of Milwaukee, for fatally shooting a black teenager back in early February.

This shooting wasn’t a case of police killing an unarmed black youth. The victim, 17-year-old Alan Cole, had been armed when police tried to arrest him on Feb. 2. The officer, Joseph Mensah, is also black, and fired only after Cole discharged his weapon, inadvertently hitting himself in the arm.

Further complicating matters is Mensah’s record: This is the third time the officer has killed someone in the line of duty in the last five years — and the third time Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm has cleared Mensah of wrongdoing in a fatal shooting.

After the decision, hundreds of protesters first took to the freeway downtown and then made their way towards the scene of the shooting in Wauwatosa. When police in riot gear blocked their path, they turned onto North Avenue and began indiscriminately smashing windows. The police eventually deployed tear gas and pepper balls, the crowd lobbed bricks at the police, and at one point a group of rioters looted a gas station until the police arrived and the guilty scattered.

The next day dawned on a community in shock. Wauwatosa belongs to the relatively buttoned-up and prosperous Milwaukee suburbs. This isn’t Minneapolis or Chicago or Philadelphia: Riots and looting don’t happen here.

One corner of town with a stretch of locally owned shops and businesses was particularly hard hit. At just this one intersection, a half-dozen businesses sustained tens of thousands of dollars in damages as the mob passed by Wednesday night.

Colectivo Coffee only had four windows busted out, but an employee told us it represented at least $1,500 in replacement costs for the owners. He adds that neighbors and volunteers had generously showed up Thursday morning to help with cleanup, although not everyone’s motives are pure. One woman in a Black Lives Matter mask, he says, made a big show of sweeping up broken glass so long as the local news cameras were filming her, but dropped the broom and walked off as soon as the cameras panned away. “She didn’t even pick up the pile of glass she was sweeping.”

Across the street, a group of middle-aged guys are cutting plywood sheets and boarding up the shattered storefronts of a local pharmacy, a wallpaper and paint store, and a nail salon. None of them work at these places — they’re just here to lend a hand.

Andrew Geisler, a 42-year-old marketer from East Wauwatosa, tells us he’d been out for a run that morning and saw his buddy putting up plywood and decided he had to come over and help. He doesn’t resent peaceful protesters, but like a lot of his neighbors, he’s angry at those responsible for smashing windows.

“This just diminishes what the protests are about,” he says, adding that he’s afraid another mob will form tonight and over the weekend. Geisler and the others all reference the unrest in Kenosha. “Some of these people are just looking for trouble,” he says. “But this has been happening all over.”

A few doors down, the Swan U-Serve Pharmacy, an independently owned pharmacy that’s been open since 1972, is also getting boarded up. The owner, Randy Dawes, 65, tells us the single broken window out front will cost him about $1,400 — and that’s out of pocket because it’s a little less than his insurance deductible.

Dawes mentions it’s not just businesses — a 70-year-old woman who lives not far from the pharmacy was at home Wednesday night when someone in the mob tossed a brick through her window.

He employs about 20 people here, and they all know the neighborhood well. One employee, an older woman who didn’t want to give us her name, said Wauwatosa used to be very conservative and Republican but in recent years has been getting more liberal and diverse. “We welcome it,” she says. “Change is good.”

At the end of the row is a Kumon Math and Reading Center for local youth—a business whose purpose is to educate children. Every one of its street-facing windows was smashed on Wednesday night. Some of the window-smashing was caught on video and posted to Twitter, which is how Geisler and a bunch of other volunteers found out about it.

That business they're attacking? It's called @Kumon_NA. It's a math tutoring program… it teaches kids math. I learned a lot there. https://t.co/NB0eo8mON8 — Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) October 8, 2020

The manager and head instructor there is Wissam Kaddoura, 47, who emigrated to the United States from Lebanon and settled in the Milwaukee area 20 years ago. He isn’t going to let a mob stop his work: When we walk in he’s sweeping up broken glass outside his office, determined to open his classrooms that afternoon.

“These people just have hate inside them,” he laments. “Is this the way you solve problems? We’re barely making it with the lockdowns, and now this.”

Kaddoura’s Kumon center had been out of business thanks to the governor’s lockdowns for three months over the spring and summer. He lost half his students, and only now is beginning to rebuild. He employs a dozen people at the center, and his students are a diverse group from all over the metro area.

He doesn’t understand the mindset of the rioters: “I’d love to ask the people who did this what they hope to accomplish,” he says, then jokes, “I’m living the American dream—working and working, and now cleaning up glass!”

As we made our way toward the door to leave he stops us and lowers his voice. “I lived for 28 years in a refugee camp. I saw people die in the streets. So this broken glass is nothing to me. But the people who do this, I want to know what they’re thinking.”

“I love this country. America gave me everything — education, wealth, safety for my children. I don’t have to worry about anything. Broken glass is no problem. People are asking me if we’re going to close today — no, we have kids to teach.”

Rioting Hits Another Wisconsin Suburb Over Black Officer Returning Fire,"Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa Wednesday night, with some of the “peaceful” demonstrators smashing windows of homes and businesses and clashing with law enforcement and the National Guard.

“What started as a protest has become a large disturbance of public order that has caused property damage and is threatening to cause injury to persons,” the Wauwatosa Police Department tweeted just before 10 p.m. Wednesday.

The protests followed Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm’s announcement that his office “could not meet the burden required to charge” Wauwatosa officer Joseph Mensah in the fatal shooting of a black teen. Mensah, also black, shot Alvin Cole, 17, in February at Wauwatosa’s Mayfair Mall after Cole fired his stolen 9 mm pistol at officers, according to the investigation summary.

It was Mensah’s third fatal shooting of a suspect in five years. He was found to have acted in self-defense in the others.

Black Lives Matter protesters have made Mensah the face of police brutality and social injustice in suburban Milwaukee, demanding the black police officer be fired and charged with homicide. They’ve received the backing of most members of Wauwatosa’s city council.

Radical leftists “targeted” Mensah, vandalized his girlfriend’s home, and fired a shotgun at the back door during a riotous demonstration in August.

“Officer Mensah attempted to establish a dialogue with the group but was ultimately physically assaulted outside his home,” the police report stated, adding that the group was estimated to consist of 60 to 70 people. Two men were arrested on felony charges.

State Rep. Rob Hutton and state Sen. Dale Kooyenga, both Brookfield Republicans, practically had to beg Wauwatosa’s far-left mayor to ask Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to keep the Wisconsin Army National Guard on standby in case things got out of hand. They finally — if begrudgingly — heeded the advice, with Evers sending in Guard members Wednesday.

Things started to get out of hand about 9 p.m., when Wauwatosa police reported “windows being broken at businesses along North Ave. between Wauwatosa Avenue (N. 76 St) and Swan Bl (N 96 St.).” Townhall reporter Julio Rosas captured the vandalism on video.

“On the ground in Wauwatosa for @townhallcom and some in the Black Lives Matter crowd are smashing storefront windows,” the reporter tweeted. Some earlier on Twitter had asked why Wauwatosa businesses would board up their windows.

In one video report, a business’s front window that apparently did not have a Black Lives Matter sign was smashed. An adjacent window with a Black Lives Matter sign was spared.

Police deployed tear gas and nonlethal weapons as protesters attempted to bust through the security lines, according to reporters on the ground. Like many Black Lives Matter protests that turned disorderly and violent, demonstrators were out past the city-imposed curfew, between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. The curfew is in effect through 6 a.m. Monday.

Wauwatosa City Hall and the city’s library announced early closings Wednesday out of concern that “civil unrest” would follow the district attorney’s decision. Schools went all-online for the day.

Wauwatosa residents watched anxiously, hoping the Milwaukee suburb wouldn’t turn into the next Kenosha, which was ravaged by three days of riots after a police officer shot a black man during a domestic incident in August. One video showed the bold line between sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement and their violent tactics.

“Do you know how many Democrats, how many [Milwaukee Public Schools] teachers, union members, other people that would support you live on this street, and you’re going to let him ride through my yard? Show some respect,” a Wauwatosa man shouted at rioters on a motorcycle.

“The cops pushed us this way, just so you know,” one of the demonstrators informed the frustrated man.

“So they pushed you into my yard?” he said, incredulously.

"No, Taking Police Out Of Schools And No Discipline Won't Help Brown Kids","Dangerous calls from activists to “defund the police,” including school police, were splashed across the headlines over the summer. Now officials in one school district at the forefront of the movement are having second thoughts.

Minneapolis Public School officials were among the first to announce they were canceling their contract with local law enforcement for school security after the tragic incident involving George Floyd occurred in that city. That the episode happened in Minneapolis was the only thing connecting local public schools, law enforcement, and Floyd. The incident had nothing to do with school safety nor the performance of local law enforcement in the schools.

The Board of Education had been looking to make such a move since at least 2017, and the heightened attention to police and racial unrest this year allowed the board to appear responsive to current events, even if the policy makes schools less safe in the event of a violent incident.

According to recent reports, however, these same school officials are considering hiring private security contractors who have backgrounds in — you guessed it — law enforcement. The vote to disband the district’s contract with local police might have been a nod to “woke” activists, but the board appears to lack confidence in the change.

It’s hard to blame them. Minneapolis school officials and others made similar moves to adopt progressive ideas for school safety and student discipline in the past, even if the research did not substantiate those ideas.

In line with a federal directive issued under the Obama administration in 2014, Minneapolis school officials use school discipline policies to lower the figure of minority students and children with special needs who faced suspension or expulsion, called “exclusionary discipline.” The district’s stated discipline policy aims to reduce “suspensions and out-of-class time, especially for our African American males and students receiving special education services,” putting data collection ahead of student behavior.

Research demonstrates that limiting exclusionary discipline does not improve student learning nor make members of a school community feel safer. We all agree that racist acts are a blight on our society, but a survey of the research on school discipline says that “once prior [student] misbehavior is taken into account, the racial differences in severity of discipline melt away,” a finding representative of the literature on this topic.

The Obama administration’s 2014 letter on school discipline threatened to investigate schools if minority students faced exclusionary discipline at higher per capita rates than white students. Large school districts around the country, such as Broward County, Florida, and the Los Angeles Unified School District, were either already limiting suspensions and expulsions in schools before the letter or did so after the administration issued the missive.

Quota-based systems that discipline students differently depending on their race or ethnicity do not take into account critical factors that affect behavior and misbehavior. Examples include the concentration of minority students from single-parent families, as well as the concentration of dangerous neighborhoods near a particular school. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago, to name a few, suggest such factors are important.

To improve these conditions, families deserve robust policy solutions. They need more opportunities to choose how and where students learn through charter schools and private school scholarships, not manufactured data reports on discipline.

The Trump administration appropriately rescinded the Obama-era Dear Colleague letter that limited school discipline because the research didn’t support it and because the “disparate impact” standard on which the letter was based is simply unlawful. Under the disparate impact theory, a public policy that affects proportionately more minority individuals would still be deemed discriminatory even when it does not seek to discriminate by treating people differently according to their race.

Disparate impact theory continues to drive discipline policies in some school systems today, including Seattle and Milwaukee. While the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to strike down disparate impact directly, ample opinions demonstrate the legal problems with basing policy on this philosophy. As the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said in 1997 in People Who Care v. Rockford Board of Education:

Racial disciplinary quotas violate equity in its root sense. They entail either systematically overpunishing the innocent or systematically underpunishing the guilty. They place race at war with justice. They teach schoolchildren an unedifying lesson of racial entitlements.

If Minneapolis school officials and other educators across the country want to keep students safe, they should abandon student discipline policies based on quotas. Teachers and parents — those adults closest to children every day — should work together to evaluate each incident on its own merits and make decisions in a child’s best interests regardless of his or her race.

"In Minneapolis, Rage And Fear Have Hobbled A Great American City","MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. — The intersection in south Minneapolis where George Floyd died in police custody on May 25 has become a quasi-religious shrine. It is a shrine not just to Floyd, who is honored here as if he were a saint or a martyr, but to the political power of the Black Lives Matter movement and the ascendency of the radical left in this city.

The intersection and the neighborhood around it have been “occupied” for months now. To get to the memorial—or “George Square,” as it’s now called—you must approach on foot. For a block in every direction, the streets are closed to traffic, barricaded by concrete roadblocks and makeshift chevaux de frise. Behind the roadblocks, plywood shields are stacked up next to a tent and an outhouse.

A young man in a pink sweater and green hair greets me as I approach. He informs me that it is Indigenous Peoples Day (formerly Columbus Day), and that there is a healing circle for indigenous peoples underway at the intersection next to the memorial. I am not allowed to take pictures of them, he says. By what authority he orders me not to take pictures, he doesn’t say. So I take pictures.

The memorial itself is a 15-foot black fist erected in the middle of the intersection of East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, festooned roundabout with flowers and signs and graffiti and flags. Every conceivable surface, from the streets and sidewalks and light poles to the buildings and bus shelters and the abandoned Speedway gas station on the corner, is covered in graffiti and posters and overlapping murals.

The whole intersection has an apocalyptic feel. Firewood is stacked up around the gas pumps for use, I’m told, by the steady stream of “people experiencing homelessness” who often “occupy” the intersection at night. Every smashable window is boarded up, and every board bears some spray-painted curse directed at the police or Trump — and if not a curse, a call for justice in the name of Floyd.

The scene recalls nothing so much as the shrines one sees in Mexico and Central America to Catholic saints or the Blessed Mother or the honored dead, with the crucial difference that here the shrine is marked not by reverence but by simmering rage. Justice, not peace, is what pilgrims to this secular shrine seek — and not justice from God, but by their own hands.

One of the thousands of signs and placards posted about the square reads: “Reconnect, this is a place of peace.” But it is not a place of peace. It is a place of tension and racial resentment and suffocating progressive orthodoxy. It’s the kind of place where you don’t want to be seen asking too many questions.

The businesses at this intersection have been all but destroyed. Cup Foods, the convenience store where a teenage clerk called 911 after Floyd tried to pass a fake $20 bill, and where he later died, didn’t reopen until Aug. 3. The store’s owners tried to open in June a few weeks after Floyd’s death but quickly closed amid backlash from activists and a self-appointed “security force” from the neighborhood.

One of the store’s co-owners, Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, is behind the counter on the phone when I walk in. After getting death threats, he now wears a gun and employs an armed security guard at the store, which has been a neighborhood staple for the past 30 years. Abumayyaleh and his brother, Samir, own the entire building, which also includes a barbershop, a laundromat, and a mosque.

But some activists and agitators want the immigrant-owned family store to shutter for good. A man who works at the Chinese takeout place across the street tells me that “a lot of people hate that guy” for calling the police on Floyd, and that he tries to stay away from there. “They do our thing and we do ours.”

Plenty of customers have also stayed away, and business has suffered terribly. An older black man behind the register at Cup Foods tells me it’s been very slow, partly because there’s no traffic coming through the intersection now and partly because some people are afraid to come. And no wonder: when the Abumayyaleh brothers reopened in August, a mob formed outside demanding they stay closed.

The misfortune of Cup Foods is worth noting because its fate, while perhaps uniquely tragic given the circumstances of Floyd’s death, has become commonplace in Minneapolis. This city has suffered from the one-two punch of widespread rioting and pandemic shutdowns that afflicted other large cities over the summer, but it has not really recovered.

Minneapolis was the last stop on a recent reporting trip that took me and my colleague, Christopher Bedford, across Michigan and Wisconsin, talking to voters, business leaders, and local elected officials about the upcoming presidential election. But here in downtown Minneapolis, there were fewer people to talk to. A shocking number of bars and restaurants are closed, buildings are boarded up, and, on the night we get into town, the streets are eerily empty — except for a lone man on a unicycle pedaling up South 6th Street, adding to the unsettling feeling of an old Marilyn Manson music video.

Our hotel was a case in point, a Marriott Signature with more than 180 rooms. Only three were booked, including ours. Because of COVID, there were only two employees at the hotel, one at the desk and one in the kitchen making pizzas. The bar was closed, the lobby was quiet and empty.

At Murray’s, a steakhouse that’s been in business since 1946 but today is limping along, mostly empty, the bartender told us things have been slow. We’re the only people in the bar. He says it’s not just the pandemic that’s cleared out downtown but all the protests and riots, too.

In late August, riots came right down this street. He points to the Starbucks across the way, where rioters smashed all the windows. They were only replaced last week. The Saks Fifth Avenue right next to it was looted. “There’s so little trust in the police now, and so many problems,” he says, then adds cautiously, “But not all of it was justified.”

No kidding — especially not in this case. What triggered the riots wasn’t a fatal police shooting or other police violence but an apparent murder-suicide. On Aug. 26, a black man who was suspected of homicide killed himself as police were closing in.

In an effort to prevent rioting, the Minneapolis Police released a surveillance video of the incident within 90 minutes showing that police officers were not involved in the use of deadly force. No matter. The downtown area near where the man committed suicide erupted in a fresh round of riots and looting, the city declared a curfew and called in the National Guard, and about 50 people were arrested that night.

From Murray’s, we have to walk more than a mile, crossing over the river, to find another bar that’s open. There we meet a bartender who tells us he’s “center-left” but plans to vote for Trump, as do many of his friends. It wasn’t hard to empathize with him. His bar was nearly empty, surrounded by shuttered establishments. It’s been that way for months now.

It’s unclear how Minneapolis will recover from nearly a half-year of rolling riots and shutdowns. With confidence in public safety shattered, residents are hesitant to venture out. The city’s once-bustling downtown nightlife — theaters and clubs and sporting events—is more or less gone. Dozens of homeless encampments have cropped up in high-visibility areas and public parks in response to the pandemic. One of them, in Powderhorn Park not far from the George Floyd memorial, was forcibly cleared by police this summer after hundreds of tents went up and the city declared the area unsafe for habitation.

None of this augurs well for Minneapolis’ future. As I leave the George Floyd memorial I walk back past the roadblock. The green-haired man is talking with a young boy, maybe eight years old, who says he had a toy police car when he was five. “I know the signs say ‘f-ck the police’ now,” the boy says. “But I liked the police back then.” The green-haired man laughs and replies, “Don’t worry! You were only five, you didn’t know any better.”

No Arrests Made After Violent Antifa Attack Hospitalizes Pro-Free Speech Demonstrators In San Fransisco,"A pro-free speech, pro-Trump, and pro-police demonstration turned violent at United Nations Plaza in San Francisco over the weekend when a group of several hundred so-called anti-fascists began attacking and throwing projectiles at protestors and police. Despite multiple attacks caught on camera, no arrests were made.

The protest, organized by “Team Save America” and Philip Anderson, was intended to “protest Twitter which it said squelches conservative speech.” Those who attended the protest in the name of free speech also expressed support for President Donald Trump and the police by wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and waving “Thin Blue Line” and U.S. flags.

The protest began peacefully, but as Anderson mounted the stage to begin his speech, anti-fascists dressed in black “surged the area, outnumbering and attacking those gathered,” according to the Associated Press. They also began throwing plastic and glass bottles at the pro-police Trump supporters.

Among those injured was Anderson, who suffered a knocked-out tooth from Antifa who attacked him “for no reason,” a Trump supporter, and at least three San Francisco police officers who were assaulted and injured with pepper spray and caustic chemicals. Multiple people were taken to the hospital.

https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779495006218416

During the attack on Anderson, people can be heard screaming “pray about it” and yelling racial expletives as he walks away holding his mouth.

https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2209454595864588

According to the Associated Press, Anderson said he “called the counterprotesters hypocrites and said they are the reason why he’s voting for President Donald Trump.”

“I love America, I love this country, and I love free speech,” he said.

The San Francisco Police Department’s response to these attacks looked drastically different compared to Phoenix law enforcement responding to a similar protest Saturday. AZ Central reports that nearly every attendee of a protest against police in downtown Phoenix was arrested “after police say the group marched in the road, knocked barricades into the road, and threw smoke bombs at officers.”

Eighteen people were arrested and were facing charges “including aggravated assault on an officer, riot, criminal damage, unlawful assembly, hindering prosecution, resisting arrest, and obstructing a road.”

The riot was first announced on social media, but only 30 minutes after it began, it was declared an unlawful assembly as protestors threw devices emitting smoke at officers.

“Phoenix PD underestimates the power of the people. March with us to occupy Washington Street and remind PD who they serve. We will not stay silent. Until we get justice, Phoenix will have no peace,” the digital flyers advertising the event stated.

Phoenix Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Ann Justus said that it was “due to the ongoing criminal activity and assault, the Phoenix Police deployed less-lethal munitions in order to safely make arrests.”

MSNBC’s Joy Reid: Black Lives Matter Never Advocated For Violence,"MSNBC’S Joy Reid says there is “zero evidence” that the Black Lives Matter movement ever advocated for violence.

“There is absolutely zero, none, zero evidence that Black Lives Matter has ever pushed for anything violent, pushed for anything violent to happen to police,” she said Thursday night after the final presidential debate of 2020.

“They have never advocated violence against police,” she added.

There are tens of thousands of data points that say otherwise from this leftist conflict monitor: https://t.co/L45HNGF52k https://t.co/qwB2diRYmU — Joy Pullmann (@JoyPullmann) October 23, 2020

Instead, Reid attempted to defend the movement by claiming they simply want racial justice, failing to mention the violent and reckless means by which some people have advocated for it.

“Black Lives Matter is about one thing: stop killing black people just because you pulled them over for parking or moving violation,” she said. “Just stop killing black people.”

“For [Trump] to traffic that again tonight was not only desperate, it was also stupid because he also wants black men to vote for him,” Reid said.

Studies and video footage from the period after George Floyd died in Minneapolis, which sparked hundreds of protests and riots across the nation, however, show that Reid may have been living under a rock over the last six months and that her perception of the movement is completely wrong.

Not only do reports from September suggest that up to 95 percent of this summer’s riots across the country are linked to BLM activism, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), but included in this data was the fact that more than 1 in 20 of U.S. protests between May 26 and Sept. 5 involved violent actions such as rioting and looting.

At least 47 people have died in riot-related circumstances, stemming from the actions of a movement which “has never pushed for anything violent,” according to Reid.

Over the last six months, rioters, posing under the guise of racial justice and change, “have burned down minority businesses, destroyed minority neighborhoods, killed a black police chief, desecrated civil rights monuments, launched deadly occupations of downtown centers, and set fire to churches” in multiple cities across the nation.

The damage inflicted by these riots is estimated to cost an inflation-adjusted $1.2 billion, much of which will come from taxpayer dollars “in the form of overtime and hazard pay for police and EMTs, emergency room visits, destruction of public property, and more.”

In California, members of the so-called “peaceful” movement which Reid claims “never advocated violence against police” blocked the emergency entrance of St. Francis hospital where two wounded police officers who were ambushed while on a patrol were recovering, chanting “We hope they die” and “Y’all gonna die one by one.”

Rioters were often caught on camera harassing police officers, throwing projectiles at them, and wishing for their death.

Reid’s claim that the people involved in BLM are peaceful is also a narrative often peddled by the mainstream media including her employer MSNBC. When riots erupted following Floyd’s death, MSNBC reported it was “mostly a protest” as buildings burned in the background.

“This mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started,” said one MSNBC reporter during a riot in Minneapolis.

30 Officers Injured After Fatal Shooting Of Armed Black Man In Philadelphia Sparks Riots,"Warning: Graphic violence and language.

A shooting of an armed black man in West Philadelphia captured on video sparked riots throughout the city leaving at least 30 police officers injured.

https://twitter.com/shanermurph/status/1320872419020677121?s=20

Police shot and killed Walter Wallace Jr., 27, on Monday after he advanced toward them while holding a knife despite officer orders to drop the weapon. While Wallace’s mother “tried desperately to stop him,” he still moved towards the officers, prompting them to fire off multiple shots.

“Why didn’t they use a taser?” said his father, Walter Wallace Sr. “His mother was trying to diffuse the situation,” he said. He said his son struggles with mental health issues and is on medication. “He has mental issues. Why you have to gun him down?” — Ellie Rushing (@EllieRushing) October 26, 2020

It’s unclear how many times Wallace was struck but there were at least 13 markers on the street and a witness said he heard about 10 shots. Cops said both officers fired “several” times — Anna Orso (@anna_orso) October 26, 2020

The video shows multiple bystanders crowding the scene to yell at the officers, surrounding Wallace who was taken to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

The shooting is under investigation.

“Fortunately it appears the officers were wearing body cameras,” Philadelphia Police Sgt. Eric Gripp. “The cameras were activated. So we should have a lot of video along with eyewitness statements.”

“Our police officers are being vilified this evening for doing their job and keeping the community safe, after being confronted by a man with a knife,” Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 John McNesby said.

Word of the shooting spread quickly and by the time the sun had set, protestors turned to rioters who took to the West Philadelphia, Center City, and North Philly streets to loot, burn, assault police officers, and attempt to prevent the press from covering the ensuing violence.

"When Kamala Could Have Pushed To Investigate Police Shootings, She Didn't","It is well documented that Kamala Harris, as the attorney general of California from 2011 through 2016, did little to bring about meaningful change to the way police officers are able to use deadly force.

During her tenure as the chief law enforcement officer of the state, Harris carefully displayed the right amount of sympathy and understanding for both sides of the debate, allowing her to claim she was taking steps to reform the criminal justice system from within.

A closer review of Harris’s actions during this time, however, paint a picture not so much of a pragmatic reformer out to reestablish the criminal justice system in new and more equitable ways, but more of a calculating, Clintonian-style politician who didn’t want to get caught on the wrong side of a volatile issue, especially when campaign donations were on the line.

This was especially evident through Harris’s silence and implied opposition to Assembly Bill 86, which would have required police shootings to be independently reviewed by the attorney general. Although Harris claimed she had practical concerns about the effect of AB-86, it’s likely she was more worried about how it would affect some of her strongest backers.

Harris Didn’t Support AB-86

In 2015, Democratic Assemblyman Kevin McCarty introduced AB-86, which would have taken the review of police shootings away from local prosecutors, giving it instead to the California attorney general. Many organizations and academics had begun to argue that the status quo created a situation fraught with bias and conflicts of interest, one from which many local prosecutors would have a hard time extricating themselves. AB-86 would have saved local prosecutors from the difficult, and likely unpopular, decision of handing the case to the state, where local police would be less likely to receive a sympathetic review.

AB-86 was supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, the California State NAACP, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and the National Association of Social Workers, among other groups. It was strongly opposed, however, by various law enforcement and district attorney associations, including the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, the California District Attorneys Association, the California Police Chiefs Association, and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.

Then the state attorney general, Harris did not take a position on the bill, even though her office had supported and sponsored numerous other items of legislation throughout her tenure. Her silence on this matter was largely understood as opposition, thus helping to kill the bill in the Assembly suspense file, which is where Assembly leadership sends problematic, contentious bills to die, ostensibly for financial reasons. Bills in the suspense file are simply held there indefinitely by order of the chair of the Appropriations Committee, without ever being given a formal vote on the floor.

AB-86 would have caused intense discomfort for some of Harris’s biggest campaign donors, such as the police officers’ unions and law enforcement organizations that contributed heavily to her campaign for attorney general. A review of the data pulled from the California secretary of state’s website, which tracks campaign contributions, shows that from 2010 to 2016, Harris received well more than $100,000 in campaign contributions from law enforcement sources, including the Association of California Highway Patrolmen ($27,200), the Police Protective League ($20,100) and the Peace Officers Research Association of California ($32,200).

In considering this legislation, Harris likely performed a cost-benefit analysis and realized that, at that moment, protecting the interests of law enforcement would provide more tangible benefits for her going forward than any substantive reform to the way law enforcement professionals apply deadly force. This is likely why her office chose to remain silent on AB-86, as well as SB-227, which removed the ability of local prosecutors to refer cases involving police shootings to grand juries.

It is also worth noting that in 2007, Harris sat on the board of directors for the California District Attorneys Association, which came out then in formal opposition to SB-1019, a bill that would have made police officer disciplinary hearings open to the public. This occurred a few years before Harris ran for attorney general, but it bolsters the argument that over the course of her career, Harris has consistently shown more interest in protecting law enforcement from increased oversight and transparency than in reigning in serious abuses.

Her Record Speaks for Itself

When CNN’s Jake Tapper pressed Harris on her refusal to support AB-86, she attempted to defuse the problem but gave such an odd and incoherent answer that the Washington Post rated it entirely false. Harris claimed she could not weigh in because she was tasked with writing legislative summaries for pending ballot measures.

This reply grossly conflated her duties as attorney general and had never prevented her from weighing in on and supporting other items of legislation. In all likelihood, this answer was simply a pretext and an attempt to divert Tapper from probing deeper into her reasoning.

It’s clear Harris never took much interest in making any meaningful changes to the criminal justice system and the handling of law enforcement cases — at least not until it became politically necessary for her to do so. She certainly paid lip service to the idea of making improvements in this area, and even helped support a few relatively anodyne pieces of legislation that seemed to take steps toward remediating the problem. On the whole, however, going back as far as 2007, it’s clear Harris had no strong desire to work toward real reform.

When given the chance to take substantive, lasting steps, Harris balked — likely because of her dependence on the endorsements and campaign contributions from those in law enforcement. Like her running mate, she had years to work toward meaningful reform, and she failed. What makes anyone think she’ll do it as vice president?

"Second Night Of Looting, Vandalism Escalates In Philadelphia Following Fatal Police Shooting","Philadelphia suffered another night of violence, looting, and chaos Tuesday, just a week before the presidential election.

The first round of riots began on Monday night after police shot and killed Walter Wallace Jr., a black man, for advancing toward them while holding a knife despite officer orders to drop the weapon. The incident, which was captured on video, sparked riots throughout the city leaving at least 30 police officers injured.

Despite pleas from members of Wallace’s family to stop the violence, the looting and chaos in the name of Black Lives Matter continued on Tuesday. Police in riot gear were deployed to the area but could not contain the approximately 1,000-person mob of looters and instead asked people to avoid certain areas of the city.

While “several hundred” members of the Pennsylvania National Guard were supposed to be deployed to the affected areas in Philly on Tuesday evening after Philadelphia County requested their presence, some reporters on the ground say that they did not see any National Guard and that the situation was out of the control of law enforcement.

"I Won’t Arrest You For Celebrating Thanksgiving, And No Good Cop Would","I work as a patrol officer in a suburb of a major U.S. metropolitan area, so I know that no good cop is interested in enforcing tyrannical and unending lockdown orders from state and local executives. Some police departments are openly declaring they won’t enforce these orders, and plenty more of this is happening quietly behind the scenes.

Statement from @OCSheriffBarnes on the limited Stay at Home Order issued by Governor Newsom. pic.twitter.com/qDnYS4fk6U — OC Sheriff, CA (@OCSheriff) November 20, 2020

In many localities, law enforcement is doing little to enforce often unconstitutional edicts from governors amid the country seemingly hating cops. Yes, the horror stories make the news, and there are too many of these. A woman was arrested at an outdoor event and tased for not wearing a mask—for being outside in the fresh air. A man was forced off a bus in Philadelphia. Two homeless men were arrested for not wearing masks in Nashville.

Yet of course you never hear about cops slowly going to an alleged mask violation so the person can leave. It doesn’t make the news, but I can tell you it happens—a lot.

The coronavirus lockdowns forced local law enforcement to change how they operate. There was a shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, N95 masks, and hand sanitizer. The usual calls to police slowed, but plenty required officers to enter a possibly contaminated home or use force to arrest someone infected with the ‘Rona. (Yes, the younger officers call it “the ‘Rona.”)

At the height of the moral panic, officers were treating their return home like a scientist exiting a laboratory with an airlock. We’d leave our gear and uniform in the mudroom or garage in the hopes we were not tracking some virus throughout the houses our families live in. I look back and laugh at how many times throughout the day I would wipe down all the surfaces in the police car knowing no one else had been in the car all day.

We eventually got supplies of PPE and felt better prepared for going into homes and using force to make arrests. We also eventually learned through data and experience that the lethality of this virus, especially to younger and healthy people, which comprise the majority of beat cops, had been highly overblown.

While typical calls slowed under lockdowns, with governors’ executive orders came an increase in a different type of call: The executive order violation. The pandemic increased the social and police power of the busybody, and executive power now empowered tattletales and nosy people. As cops dealing with more serious issues daily, we knew complaints about people not wearing masks properly were a complete waste of our time and public resources.

I remember going for a call complaining about six people standing on a suburban street corner talking to each other not “social distancing.” I drove by waving and when I came back the culprits were gone.

I joked with another officer about a call for an executive order violation involving a child’s birthday party. Eyes rolled. When the officer responded, no violations were observed.

A complaint for loud music was reported at an apartment complex on a Sunday afternoon. The friendly officer walked up the stairs to the apartment and heard hymns and people singing. The churches had been closed, but here were Christians daring to be Christians. The officer politely asked the residents to keep the noise down and left.

Another call occurred in the middle of the hysteria, when an older white woman walked into a supermarket in an outdoor parking lot. She said she saw a younger black male wearing his mask below his nose. The woman asked him to wear it above his nose.

The young black man did not appreciate being corrected and started to yell profanities, threats and accusations of racism. The older woman was scared enough to call the police and thought this mask offender might ambush her in the parking lot or follow her home. Needless to say, the police never located the villain who wore his mask below his nose.

Local playgrounds were closed and skate parks were chained and locked. Skateboarders decided to do something about that. The skateboarders presumably cut a hole in the fence and entered the outdoor skate park.

An older gentleman walked over to me, as I was near this skate park at the time. He politely told me there were people in the skate park and the skate park was closed. I had my required face covering on, but he must have seen half the expression on my face. He paused and said, “I guess I’m being a rat, huh?” My reply: “You said it, sir.”

Many police offers I know are using their discretion to refrain from strictly enforcing sanctimonious and unconstitutional edicts amid a moral panic. In a world where the police in the United States are routinely compared to Nazis, these officers look the other way. They choose to not use the power of the executive to enforce new rules that didn’t make much sense.

I’m certain the vast majority of violations are being ignored with verbal warnings at worst. My personal worry is encountering someone tired of the orders and contrarian enough to be willing to get arrested either out of frustration or to make a point. I pray I don’t have to go to that call because I don’t want to arrest people under those circumstances.

Yes, governors, mayors, and executives give orders. The rank and file police officer is the one tasked with enforcing them. What you have to worry about is the police chief and commanders requiring arrests and statistics. You have to worry about the busybody with connections to someone in power.

Absent those directives, if the police are called on your Thanksgiving get-together, you’ll most likely not know it or get a polite knock on your door. The officer will probably enjoy the smell of a home-cooked meal and be glad others are enjoying Thanksgiving after a year like 2020. If you aren’t scared, invite the officer in for some turkey and stuffing. Tip: I like dark meat.

"As Violence Rises, Minneapolis City Council Begins Defunding Police","The Minneapolis City Council unanimously voted to redirect approximately $8 million from the police department despite rising violence in the city since the death of George Floyd in May.

The budget cut was reworked last minute to avoid cutting police staff after objections from Mayor Jacob Frey, who threatened to veto the measure set to eliminate more than 100 officers from the force starting in 2022. It passed early Thursday. Instead of mandating that the millions of dollars be used to train and improve policing to quell violence in the city, the funds will be diverted into “mental health teams, violence prevention programs, and other initiatives.”

In June, the same City Council unanimously passed a resolution replacing the Minneapolis Police Department with a model focused on community safety, jumpstarting a movement with “the intent to create a transformative new model for cultivating safety in our city.”

“The murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, by Minneapolis police officers is a tragedy that shows that no amount of reforms will prevent lethal violence and abuse by some members of the Police Department against members of our community, especially Black people and people of color,” said five of the city council members in the proposal.

Following Floyd’s death and the city council’s decision, however, Minneapolis suffered from chaotic protests, destructive riots, and a rise in violence such as shootings and violent carjackings.

Since the beginning of the year, Minneapolis clocked more than 500 gunshot victims, a higher number than any of the city’s tallies in the last 16 years, and a 64 percent rise in shootings and homicides from the last four years. Since more than 100 Minneapolis Police Department officers have left their positions due to rising street opposition to the badge in blue, the violence has surged, even when people were told to stay home due to COVID-19.

Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the officers’ mass departure paired with the city council’s decisions over the last six months have taken a toll on the department’s ability to address the city’s crime and problems in a timely manner.

“Everyone is stretched a little more than thin — community outreach and other specialty programs have had to go,” one officer told Fox News. “And we can’t do the investigations we used to.”

Even after the city deployed employees called “violence interrupters” from the Office of Violence Prevention, patrolling the streets in “bright orange t-shirts…armed with knowledge about their community and a desperate wish to stop the gunfire” and prevent situations before they need police interference, Minneapolis citizens, including teens and children, continued losing their lives.

“You have gunshots every half hour or every hour, some of them ending up in a shooting, some of them ending up with a death,” former Minneapolis City Councilman Don Samuels told CBS 4. “You can have one a half a mile in one direction and the next 10 minutes a half a mile in the other direction. This is at 2 o’clock, 3 o’clock in the morning. Interrupters are not going to be able to solve that,” he continued.

This violence, the Star Tribune noted, has largely affected black and Latino neighborhoods, the same ones for which those calling for defunding the police claim they seek justice.

Biden Laments GOP Wins: They 'Beat The Living Hell Out Of Us' Over 'Defund The Police',"In a leaked call released Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden warned civil rights leaders that it was the ‘defund the police’ push that granted Republicans victories in many down-ballot races on Nov. 3.

“That’s how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we’re talking about defunding the police,” Biden said.

Biden’s panic is similar to some Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, who cautioned colleagues on a call in early November that promoting and campaigning on a far-left social agenda hurt them badly in 2020.

“[If] we are going to run on Medicare for All, defund the police, socialized medicine, we’re not going to win,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina said.

During that same call, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia echoed Clyburn’s concerns, saying that if leftists couldn’t reevaluate the platforms they relied on for the Nov. 3 election, they would lose in a landslide in the 2022 midterms.

“No one should say ‘defund the police’ ever again,” Spanberger said. “Nobody should be talking about socialism.”

While Biden attempted to reassure others on the call including Rev. Al Sharpton, the NAACP’s Derrick Johnson, and former congressman Cedric Richmond, that keeping police officers accountable is still a priority, the former vice president also expressed worry that the ‘defund the police’ image would affect Senate runoff races in Georgia in January and whether Republicans keep control of the upper chamber.

“I also don’t think we should get too far ahead of ourselves on dealing with police reform in that, because they’ve already labeled us as being ‘defund the police,’ anything we put forward in terms of the organizational structure to change policing — which I promise you, will occur. Promise you,” Biden said.

In addition to his view that “defund the police” contradicts the unity platform he continues to preach, Biden also pushed back on the leaders’ calls to fix the police “problem” with executive actions and orders.

“I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds,” he said.

Moments later, however, Biden promised to use presidential authority to undo President Donald Trump’s orders and actions.

“Our only hope and the way to deal with it is, where I have executive authority, I will use it to undo every single damn thing this guy has done by executive authority, but I’m not going to exercise executive authority where it’s a question, where I can come along and say, ‘I can do away with assault weapons,’” he said. “There’s no executive authority to do away that. And no one has fought harder to get rid of assault weapons than me, me, but you can’t do it by executive order.”

"Portland’s New ‘Autonomous Zone’ Welcomes Antifa, Weapons, And Violence Against Police","Tensions surrounding the new Portland autonomous zone, named “Red House on Mississippi,” are rising after members began arming themselves and stockpiling weapons a few days into their occupation. The violent protestors have attacked and threatened journalists and police officers.

The zone was established after the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office attempted to “re-secure a home” from protestors who had barricaded themselves onto the property on Tuesday. The house reportedly belonged to a black family who “lived there for decades,” but lost to foreclosure.

During the Sheriff’s attempts to allow the new owners to “erect fencing and board up the house” on Tuesday, people threw projectiles at officers. Shortly after the officers arrested some of the crowd for protesting, they were forced to return to the area where they were attacked again with projectiles after approximately 200 people knocked down the fence.

Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell issued a statement calling for a peaceful resolution to the occupation of the public space near downtown Portland.

“We are greatly concerned about the fortification of barricades, stockpiling of weapons, armed sentries, attacks on journalists & threats to kill officers in graffiti in this public space,” he wrote.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who was hesitant to push back on the violent protests, riots, and occupations in his city earlier this summer, was quick to denounce the violence against Portland police on Tuesday. He authorized police “to use all lawful means to end the illegal occupation on North Mississippi Avenue and to hold those violating our community’s laws accountable.”

“There will be no autonomous zone in Portland,” Wheeler said.

We all agree many of our nation’s systems and structures are fundamentally racist and require significant reform. There’s a housing crisis, a health care crisis, an education crisis, an employment crisis, a mental health crisis, and an addiction crisis. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) December 9, 2020

The mayor claimed that while the U.S. is “fundamentally racist,” breaking the law does more harm than good. He also took a stand against the reason for the occupation, noting that the foreclosure was legally executed.

It’s also true that illegal trespassing, ignoring lawful orders from police, blocking sidewalks and streets, and intimidating neighbors inflame these crises and make them more difficult to solve. That is what’s happening on North Mississippi Avenue right now. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) December 9, 2020

It’s time for the encampment and occupation to end. There are many ways to protest and work toward needed reform. Illegally occupying private property, openly carrying weapons, threatening and intimidating people are not among them. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) December 9, 2020

The Portland Police Bureau also condemned the protestors actions and promised that force would be used “if necessary.”

“Portland Police do not want a confrontation, but will act to enforce the law and use of force if necessary to clear this private and public land,” the release said.

Here Are All The Times Raphael Warnock Revealed His Radical Beliefs,"Georgia Democrat Senate runoff candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock has a radical agenda, one that he has publicly, repeatedly stated both on the campaign trail and from the pulpit in his own church, Ebenezer Baptist in Atlanta.

Warnock and his campaign have tried to downplay his radical beliefs by backtracking, or even lying about the pastor’s comments. Here is a record of what he actually said:

Praise for Fidel Castro

In a 2016 sermon, Warnock eulogized communist Cuban dictator Fidel Castor, a man responsible for tens of thousands of brutal state murders, days after the dictator passed away.

“We pray for the people of Cuba in this moment. We remember Fidel Castro, whose legacy is complex. Don’t let anyone tell you a simple story; life usually isn’t very simple. His legacy is complex, kind of like America’s legacy is complex,” Warnock said.

Weeks before the video resurfaced, Warnock told CNN’s Jake Tapper he had never “celebrated” the foreign tyrant.

“Do you understand why people would be appalled by anyone celebrating Fidel Castro?”

“Well, absolutely, and I never have,” Warnock said.

Warnock also received pushback after it was revealed that he was the youth pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, New York when it hosted and praised Castro at what the Miami Herald labeled a “lovefest.” Warnock’s campaign said he did not have a say in the decision to welcome Castro to the church.

Labeling Police Officers ‘Bullies’

While many Democrats, including Joe Biden, have cautioned against using language and or talking points openly supporting defunding police, if only because it cost their party many down-ballot races to the GOP, the reverend has consistently used anti-police rhetoric from the pulpit.

In a March 2015 sermon, Warnock referred to law enforcement officers as “gangsters and thugs.”

“So in Ferguson, police power showing up in a kind of gangster and thug mentality – you know you can wear all kinds of colors and be a thug. You can sometimes wear the colors of the state and behave like a thug,” Warnock said.

Months later, he called the police “bullies.”

“When you think about the fact that America still warehouses 25 percent of the world’s prisoners, we shouldn’t be surprised when we see police officers act like bullies on the street,” Warnock said.

A ‘Pro-Choice Pastor’

Warnock has publicly labeled himself a “pro-choice pastor,” repeatedly expressing support for abortion despite receiving pushback from other Georgia pastors and pro-life groups.

“Reverend Warnock believes a patient’s room is too small a place for a woman, her doctor, and the U.S. government and that these are deeply personal health care decisions — not political ones,” Warnock campaign spokesperson Michael J. Brewer told Fox News. “He also believes those who are concerned about life, ought to be focused on the incredibly high rates of infant mortality and maternal mortality and working to make sure we are expanding access to health care, not taking it away.”

Warnock’s stance on abortion has landed him endorsements from pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood Action Fund and NARAL.

Anti-Israel, Pro-Palestinian

In 2015, Warnock delivered a Palm Sunday sermon in which he criticized Israel as an “apartheid” state, claiming that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to a two-state solution in the Middle East was like saying “occupation today, occupation tomorrow, occupation forever,” echoing the segregationist George Wallace who called for “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever.”

“If you do not have a Palestinian state, you will have apartheid in Israel that denies other citizens, sisters, and brothers citizenship, or you will have a democracy that is not a Jewish state,” Warnock stated.

Warnock claimed Israeli leaders are “racists” and called Jesus, who was Jewish, a “poor Palestinian prophet,” likening support for the Palestinian movement to support for Black Lives Matter.

“We know what it’s like to stand up and have a peaceful demonstration and have the media focus on a few violent uprisings. But you have to look at those Palestinian sisters and brothers, who are struggling for their human dignity and they have a right to self-determination, they have a right to breathe free,” he said.

After receiving backlash for being anti-Israel and anti-Jew, Warnock wrote an opinion editorial, disputing some of his previous claims about Israel, but still calling for a two-state solution.

Supporting Supreme Court Packing

During a debate with incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Warnock repeatedly refused to say whether he would support packing the Supreme Court.

“Reverend Warnock, if Democrats do win control of the U.S. Senate, there will be pressure to increase the size of the U.S. Supreme Court. Would you support adding more justices to the Supreme Court to offset President Trump’s recent appointments, and do you think there need to be term limits for justices on the bench?” the moderator asked.

After dodging the question multiple times, Warnock declined to answer.

“I’m really not focused on it,” Warnock responded, again pivoting away from the topic to talk about health care while never answering the question.

Praising A Radical Antisemitic Group

In 2013, Warnock gave a speech labeling the radical and notably antisemitic Nation of Islam group led by Louis Farrakhan as “ important for the development of Black theology.”

“It was the black Muslims who challenged black preachers and said, ‘you’re promulgating … the white man’s religion. That’s a slave religion. You’re telling people to focus on heaven, meanwhile, they’re catching hell,’” Warnock said

In addition to making radical comments about killing babies, the Israeli people, and engaging in anti-police rhetoric, The New Georgia Project, formerly led by Warnock, is under investigation for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents.

Warnock also came under fire after reports resurfaced of his involvement in a 2002 child abuse investigation.

Going Soft On Crime Has Turned Seattle Into Another American Wasteland,"“Seattle no longer feels the need to stop anyone from doing anything for any reason, at any time. The most stunning city in America is dying, all right.”

So begins “The Fight for the Soul of Seattle,” a 90-minute documentary produced by KOMO News, which for years has reported on Seattle’s pervasive drug problems and associated perils. The local news station, which premiered the feature last weekend, produced a similarly themed broadcast entitled “Seattle is Dying” last year that received more than 10 million views and several regional film awards.

Over the last 10 years, Seattle has experienced a dramatic increase in crime tied to rampant addiction and homelessness. For example, the Seattle Police Department reported a 50 percent increase in calls related to life-threatening emergencies, assault, and burglary, as well as an 80 percent increase in calls for domestic violence. In 2020 alone, the murder rate was double the average of the past decade.

Through investigative reporting that mixes in testimony from citizens, city officials, and even addicts, the film lays out its central thesis: There exists a “philosophical divide” when it comes to governing Seattle, with city leaders on one side and failed citizens on the other. Unless these politicians change course and shift from their misguided compassion to real solutions, these epidemics will escalate and ultimately destroy the Emerald City.

CHAZ: A Symbol of Seattle’s Decay

Perhaps the most significant demonstration of Seattle’s stark divide was in the city’s response to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, also known as CHAZ or CHOP, a six-block stretch that was overtaken and declared independent by local activists amid this summer’s Black Lives Matter protests. In a move that garnered national attention, the City of Seattle instructed police to cede control of the area, which included a police precinct as well as homes, businesses, and citizens suddenly left to fend for themselves.

City officials outwardly touted the zone as a quaint block party where people sang around bonfires and distributed free kebabs. Mayor Jenny Durkan suggested CHAZ would bring about a “summer of love,” and city councilmembers cheered with celebratory selfies.

Those grounded in reality, however, recognized the truth: The zone bred lawlessness and violence. “In eight days, there were five shootings in the CHOP area, with six victims,” KOMO reported. “There was a rape and various assaults and beatings and buildings set on fire.”

Still, the city refused to step in until it was too late. On June 20, 19-year-old Lorenzo Anderson was shot and killed. Police couldn’t clear the area, and first responders were too late. A week later, 16-year-old Antonio Mays Jr. was killed. Police did not arrive until five hours after the shooting.

Even after the zone’s dissolution, violence and protests have continued largely unabated. In August, activists tried to cement shut a police precinct and set it ablaze with the express intent of trapping officers inside to die. Looting and rioting have all but destroyed the city’s retail core, contributing to the closures of more than 140 businesses, from big-name department stores such as Macy’s and Columbia to iconic local businesses such as Bergman Luggage and Zanadu comics.

The Failed ‘Compassion’ of City Leaders

How did Seattle get here? Look no further than the City Council, which has aided and abetted this rising criminality by crippling the Seattle Police Department. “The institution of policing itself must be dismantled,” Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda said during one meeting earlier this year. Councilmember Lorena Gonzales agreed, saying, “Now is the time to divest from the police department.”

True to their words, the council disbanded the SPD’s Navigation Team, which partnered with social workers to engage the homeless and clear the encampments that pervade the city. They later voted to slash the SPD budget by 20 percent, prompting layoffs and the resignation of Chief Carmen Best.

“The overriding goal is to impose social justice as opposed to criminal justice,” posits one Seattle judge in the film, and City Attorney Pete Holmes has led the charge. Since taking office in 2010, Holmes has adopted a policy of diversion, partnering with the Department of Public Defense to pressure Seattle’s judges into upholding a catch-and-release policy wherein repeat offenders are not sentenced or held accountable, but directed to social services or let go altogether.

Under Holmes’s direction, the city has effectively legalized stealing and has opted not to prosecute nearly all crimes that fall beneath a felony conviction. This “hands-off” approach sounds loving in theory, but in practice it has allowed many violent offenders, some with upwards of 75 convictions, to roam free.

Seattleites Have Been Hoodwinked

While Seattle is famously leftist, residents did not ask for this. Although elections are often a choice between far-left and even further left, nearly all major city leaders campaigned on a tough approach to crime and advocated for more police as recently as last year.

My district’s council representative, Dan Strauss, told the Seattle Times that he supported adding officers as well as establishing an entirely new precinct in North Seattle. Andrew Lewis, another councilmember, admitted during his campaign that “we don’t have the staffing numbers to have effective community policing strategies that deter the kinds of crimes of opportunity that are prolific.”

As soon as the political winds blew the other way, however, the council changed its tune. Councilwoman Lisa Herbold, for example, previously backed a plan to add 200 officers to the force, yet this year she pledged to defund police and most recently sponsored a proposal that would expand “duress” as a legal defense to include symptoms of addiction, mental illness, or poverty.

If passed, the measure would help a criminal evade conviction by simply blaming his or her crime on a drug problem or financial need, for example. As former public safety adviser, Scott Lindsay notes, “Over 100 different crimes listed under the Seattle municipal code would effectively be nullified,” including assaults, harassment, trespassing, and even cyberstalking and sexual exploitation.

Dear Seattle, It’s Time to Intervene

The events of this year have brought to the fore Seattle’s preeminent failing: It has mistaken nonintervention for compassion and has tolerated addiction, crime, and homelessness to the point of cruelty. As former addict Ginny Burton warns, leaving addicts unsupported and expecting them to make rational choices for themselves is its own form of insanity. “As a society,” she says, “we’re loving people to death.”

The documentary mentions a notoriously dangerous stretch of Third Avenue in downtown Seattle, which sees hundreds of assaults per year and has three times the crime reports of anywhere else in the city. For two years, I used a bus stop on this block for work, and every single day I witnessed a plethora of illegal activities: people dealing drugs, shooting up heroin, selling stolen goods, defecating on the sidewalk, and violently harassing passersby.

Several of my coworkers have been physically assaulted walking to work, and the Starbucks beneath our office is the victim of frequent theft and vandalism. One memorable afternoon, a group of us looked across the street to see two homeless people openly fornicating on a park bench, yet we didn’t even find it shocking. Why would we? These crimes are now ubiquitous in nearly all Seattle neighborhoods.

The fight for the soul of Seattle, it seems, is not between left and right, nor between the government and the people. It is between those who prefer to look away and those who see this crisis for what it is. Let’s hope the latter wins.

Three Injured In Nashville Explosion Police Say Was 'Intentional',"Three people were injured from an explosion in downtown Nashville that came in the early hours of Christmas morning, police said.

According to the Associated Press, each person taken to a nearby hospital remains in stable condition as of Friday evening from the blast that police believe was intentional. They do not yet know the motive.

“To this point, we do believe that the explosion was an intentional act,” a police spokesman told reporters, according to BBC News.

“This morning’s attack on our community was intended to create chaos and fear in this season of peace and hope,” Nashville Mayor John Cooper said in a news conference following the announcement of a curfew. “But Nashvillians have proven time and time again that the spirit of our city cannot be broken.”

Police said warnings preceded the blast from an RV, declaring a bomb would go off in 15 minutes. This provoked evacuations from nearby buildings and the deployment of a bomb squad. The explosion occurred about 6:30 a.m. near the headquarters for Lyft and a major AT&T data center, leading to service outages.

Nashville Metro Police Chief John Drake told reporters, according to CBS, that authorities are investigating whether the Christmas detonation was linked to the ride-sharing company or AT&T.

BREAKING: This is the RV that exploded on 2nd Ave N this morning. It arrived on 2nd Ave at 1:22 a.m. Have you seen this vehicle in our area or do you have information about it? Please contact us via Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463 or online via https://t.co/dVGS7o0m4v. @ATFHQ pic.twitter.com/JNx9sDinAH — Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) December 25, 2020

The major telecommunications company said the building hit by the blast was its central office of a telephone exchange. AT&T acknowledged the explosion had disrupted service but did not say how widespread, the Associated Press reported.

The incident prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily halt air traffic leaving Nashville International Airport, due to the outages caused by the bomb.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/12/26/three-injured-in-nashville-christmas-day-explosion-police-say-was-intentional/,2020-12-26
Radical Democrats Are Turning Minneapolis Into A Violent Wasteland,"The world witnessed in the streets of Minneapolis this spring and summer the feature presentation after many increasingly violent coming attractions, created, produced, and distributed by a one-party, radical left government.

If you want to know what the real-time self-destruction of a city looks like, Minneapolis offers the perfect model. This is no Detroit-esque collapse prompted by the degeneration of an industry-dependent metropolis. This is the willful push down the path of ruin of a city burgeoning with opportunity and rife with promises of the American Dream. It is suicide.

Downtown’s ghost-town feel is taking a dystopian turn as empty streets are being taken over by a resurging homeless population openly using drugs and increasingly aggressive. The mentally ill are left to similar fates, often found huddled in bus shelters.

A decline in police and mental health resources compounds the impending disaster as winter deepens and shelters fill. This is a city in which some of the most recognizable companies make their national and regional headquarters: Target, General Mills, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Xcel Energy. They have the resources to ride out the lockdowns, but the corner hot-dog stand, skyway mini-mart, and corner bar likely don’t.

The disease plaguing the streets of Minneapolis’ north side and the areas around Chicago Avenue and Lake Street is less about COVID and more about the consequences of what Fyodor Dostoyevsky asks of man in “Notes from the Underground,” “But why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos?” For a far-left Minneapolis City Council at war with its police force and local citizens yet maintaining control due to leftist activism and special interests, the answer may be in the blind devotion to the radical belief of constantly burning and building into the unattainable utopia they so hubristically believe they can create.

This idea has been building for some time. After Jamar Clark was killed by police in Minneapolis in November 2015, three weeks of protests ensued, including a freeway shut-down, rallies, and sit-ins at City Hall and the Fourth Precinct police station.

These were organized by the newly formed group Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar (TCCJ4J), an organization connected with the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (NAARPR), a Marxist group allied with Angela Davis and the Black Lives Matter organization. They culminated in the resignation of MPD Chief Janeé Harteau at the request of the Democratic Party mayor of Minneapolis, Betsy Hodges, in 2017.

Any lessons that could have been learned were repeatedly and effectively dismissed by civic leaders, government officials, and radical counter-community groups as insufficient to counter what they believe is an inherently racist system. City government, which is wholly controlled by Democrats, simply moved the deck chairs on this sinking ship at the behest of radical groups using intimidation tactics to encourage not justice and reform, but to disband the police department.

As the leadership vacuum in the city erased fortitude in the name of justice, violent rioters, looters, and opportunists sought their fortunes amid the helpless businesses in their paths. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey sacrificed the Police Third Precinct building, let the roving mob reduce the city to a smoldering pile of ashes, then engaged the equally inept governor in a game of finger-pointing to evade his responsibility to a community suffering from shell-shock.

Although seemingly improbable, the situation in Minneapolis has declined since the riots, at least for the citizens held hostage by the smug arrogance of the people charged with acting in their best interest. The city earned the nickname “Murdereapolis” during its crime spike in the mid-‘90s. Instead of looking to successful policies used to counter that crime wave—increasing the number and presence of law enforcement officers for several months—the Minneapolis City Council wants to do the exact opposite.

In June, the council forwarded a proposal to the city’s charter commission to give voters a chance to eliminate the funding requirement for the police department. That proposal would have allowed the city to defund and dismantle the police and create a new Community Safety and Violence Prevention department. The commission tabled the proposal for a later date.

Meanwhile, homicides in Minneapolis reached 77 on just one day this month and a murder rate, according to AH Datalytics, up more than 78 percent relative to 2019. Violent crime is also at record levels, and property crime, robberies, theft, and carjackings have all increased substantially as well.

Final national murder update of 2020: Murder up 36.7% in 57 agencies with data through at least September (though most have data through November). Murder up in 51 of 57, 37 of 58 agencies reporting murder up more than 30%. Spreadsheet here: https://t.co/vEhKHuFNrY pic.twitter.com/5HgVmwGmDS — Jeff Asher (@Crimealytics) December 29, 2020

Despite pleas from citizens held captive in their own homes and speaking out through community groups like Lisa Clemons’s A Mother’s Love Initiative, the radicals on the City Council use race to perpetuate a culture of victimhood to advance their agenda, instead of finding ways to work with community groups and the police to solve problems. Now, eight residents are suing the City Council and Frey, arguing they violated the city charter’s requirement to staff approximately 743 officers for the 425,000-person city.

Since May, roughly 150 of approximately 800 MPD officers have quit, retired, or taken disability or personal leaves. The shortage prompted Police Chief Medaria Arradondo to request hiring officers from other jurisdictions. He met skepticism and a severe budget shortfall that ironically has resulted in the City of Minneapolis paying officers to retire.

To add to the frustration of a city desperate for an end to the chaos and for leaders to increase public safety and heal the city, in an Orwellian-named “Safety for All Budget Plan” the council cut $8 million from the mayor’s 2021 police budget.

The mayor had proposed 888 officers, a number already reduced by the city’s budget woes, but the city only funded an average of 770 officers for 2021. For a city in crisis, this makes as much sense as trying to put out a fire with a can of gasoline. The only thing this plan will extinguish is any hope for the people left suffering daily violence in their neighborhoods.

A city reeling from a summer of chaos and violence and serving as a laboratory for radical, power-mongering autocrats is a case study in how a city commits suicide. Just don’t phone the police. There might not be anyone to answer the call.

D.C. Police Warn Rep. Lauren Boebert Against Bringing Gun To Congress,"Washington, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee III warned Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert against packing her firearm on Capitol Hill Monday, after the freshman Colorado representative released an ad promising to do just that.

Let me tell you why I WILL carry my Glock to Congress. Government does NOT get to tell me or my constituents how we are allowed to keep our families safe. I promise to always stand strong for our 2nd Amendment rights.https://t.co/E75tYpdN4B pic.twitter.com/qg7QGenrNo — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 4, 2021

“That Congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that’s caught on the D.C. streets carrying a firearm,” Contee told reporters at a press conference when asked about the newly elected lawmaker’s plans.

According to Politico, lawmakers are exempt from the District’s strict prohibition on firearms as along as members keep their weapons unloaded and stored in their own offices. In her three-minute viral video, however, Boebert, whose gun-rights activism served as the catalyst for her political career, pledged to carry her gun outside the four walls of her Longworth office.

“I will carry my firearm in D.C., and in Congress,” Boebert said. “I walk to my office every morning by myself, so as a 5-foot-tall, 100-pound woman, I choose to protect myself legally, because I am my best security.”

The D.C. police chief said his office would be reaching out to Boebert regarding her intentions. An office spokesman for the Colorado congresswoman reassured The Federalist Boebert would follow the District’s guidelines but did not elaborate further.

“Congresswoman Boebert is a fierce advocate for the Second Amendment, as such she will comply with all applicable firearm laws and regulations,” the spokesman said.

According to the Washington Post, a spokesman said Boebert was not armed during the making of her video, contrary to what the ad’s intro implies. The District of Columbia does not recognize out-of-state concealed-carry licenses, and nonresidents such as Boebert must register their firearms with D.C. police.

A group of House Democrats launched an effort in December to ban lawmakers from carrying firearms after Boebert approached Capitol Police over the issue at new-member orientation. About two-dozen Democrats, the Hill reported, sought to overturn the local gun-law exemption for lawmakers provided by a 1967 regulation. The rules package proposed by Democrats, however, includes no such proposal to repeal the exemption. While the Capitol Hill complex is fitted with armed officers protecting each building, security at the Capitol has been compromised before. In 1954, a group of Puerto Rican radicals stormed the House chamber and began shooting in an attack that ultimately injured five members, all of whom survived. Bullet holes can still be seen in the chamber today.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/05/dc-police-warn-freshman-rep-lauren-boebert-against-bringing-gun-to-congress/,2021-01-05
Top Capitol Security Officials Resign Following Failures During Riot,"Just one day after a mob entered the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, three top Capitol security officials are set to step down from their positions.

“I am respectfully submitting my letter of resignation, effective Sunday, January 16, 2021,” Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund wrote on Thursday. “It has been a pleasure and true honor to serve the United States Capitol Police Board and the Congressional community alongside the women and men of the United States Capitol Police.”

Sund’s resignation comes after multiple members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle questioned the lack of law enforcement at the building on Wednesday and criticized the protocols of capitol security.

“Yesterday represented a massive failure of institutions, protocols, and planning that are supposed to protect the first branch of our federal government,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. “A painstaking investigation and thorough review must now take place and significant changes must follow.”

Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also declared in a press conference on Thursday afternoon that she was publicly calling for the resignation of Sund after the failure to keep people out of the building and under control.

Both the House sergeant-at-arms, Paul D. Irving, and the Senate sergeant-at-arms, Michael C. Stenger, also intend to resign from their positions following pressure from congressional leaders. Due to Wednesday’s riot, five people died, including a police officer.

One woman, 35-year-old Ashli Babbitt, was shot by a senior U.S. Capitol Police officer inside the breached building after it appears she tried to climb through the broken glass on a door. She was unarmed at the time. Three other people reportedly died during Wednesday’s chaos as a result of unspecified “medical emergencies.”

Shortly after Sund’s resignation announcement, police confirmed that a capitol police officer, Brian Sicknick, also died during the riot. According to Fox News, Sicknick’s death will be investigated as a homicide by Capitol Police, Washington DC’s Metropolitan police, and other federal agencies.

Watch The Capitol Police Open The Doors And Invite Protesters In,"Capitol police appeared to let a mass of Trump demonstrators right into the Capitol building at one entry point Wednesday after the crowd breached the perimeter surrounding the complex.

“I disagree with it but I respect what you’re trying to do,” one officer can be heard in the video.

Brief skirmishes at other points of entry bought little time for people inside to prepare for the coming siege. Once police lines broke, security became overwhelmed at the size of the mob breaking through, with some of the rioters armed with a form of pepper spray. Clashes occurred at various entrances.

After breaching the Capitol complex, rioters smashed doors, shattered windows, ravaged offices, and breached both legislative chambers, interrupting congressional business and prompting members to hide or evacuate, culminating in some of the most devastating security failures since the War of 1812. Top officials charged with protecting the nation’s seat of government resigned in the aftermath, following top lawmakers’ demands to step down.

“I am respectfully submitting my letter of resignation, effective Sunday, January 16, 2021,” Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund wrote in a Thursday statement. “It has been a pleasure and true honor to serve the United States Capitol Police Board and the Congressional community alongside the women and men of the United States Capitol Police.”

I Saw Provocateurs At The Capitol Riot On Jan. 6,"The deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol bore the markings of an organized operation planned well in advance of the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress.

A small number of cadre appeared to use the cover of a huge rally to stage its attack. Before it began, I saw from my vantage point on the West Front of the Capitol what appeared to be four separate cells or units:

Plainclothes militants. Militant, aggressive men in Donald Trump and MAGA gear at a front police line at the base of the temporary presidential inaugural platform; Agents-provocateurs. Scattered groups of men exhorting the marchers to gather closely and tightly toward the center of the outside of the Capitol building and prevent them from leaving; Fake Trump protesters. A few young men wearing Trump or MAGA hats backwards and who did not fit in with the rest of the crowd in terms of their actions and demeanor, whom I presumed to be Antifa or other leftist agitators; and Disciplined, uniformed column of attackers. A column of organized, disciplined men, wearing similar but not identical camouflage uniforms and black gear, some with helmets and GoPro cameras or wearing subdued Punisher skull patches.

All of these cells or groups stood out from the very large crowd by their behavior and overall demeanor. However, they did not all appear at the same time. Not until the very end did it appear there was a prearranged plan to storm the Capitol building, and to manipulate the unsuspecting crowd as cover and as a follow-on force.

Eyewitness Account, with No Outside Details

This article is a first-person, eyewitness account drafted the night of Jan. 6 and morning of Jan. 7, so it is not affected by other news coverage or information. The only research aids used in this article were photos and videos that I took from my phone.

I have witnessed and participated in scores of protests since the 1970s when as a high school student I was trained by professional agitators from California. Apart from my professional background and experience, nothing in this article is derived from any third-party information or analysis.

In editing this for publication, I fought the temptation to add new information that I had subsequently learned from my own or from other people’s accounts. Other reports will vary and may contain contradicting information, and will contain far more facts than appear here. Many well-known actions and developments reported in the news do not appear here, as this is purely what I saw and understood between about 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on Jan. 6.

Anti-riot Police Prepared Early, But Presence Was Light

Originally I had planned not to attend any of the several pro-Trump events scheduled for that day. At the last minute, a companion and I decided to see what we could see. Late that morning, at about 11:30, I walked from near Union Station to the Senate side of Capitol Hill on 2nd and D Streets NW and noticed a small number of Capitol Police dressed in full riot gear, with shin guards and shoulder guards. One carried a black baton with side handle.

“That’s old school,” I called to the officer, giving him a thumbs-up. The police appeared to be readying to board a van or bus, although the Capitol was only 2-1/2 blocks away.

I crossed behind the Russell Senate Office Building to Constitution Avenue near the Capitol, past some out-of-towners who pointed at the Capitol and asked if it was the White House, then walked for about 25 minutes up Pennsylvania Avenue toward an empty Freedom Park.

A rally had just taken place there and moved to the Ellipse, the large lawn between the White House and Constitution Avenue NW. President Trump was speaking to a huge crowd at the Ellipse, although the Freedom Park rally had broken up to assemble at the Capitol before we arrived.

For such a massive event, police presence was light. District of Columbia police and a small group of DC National Guard had a relaxed demeanor, keeping a professional distance from marchers and other pedestrians, as they usually do. A few police and National Guard gathered around a mobile device to listen to the president make what sounded like rousing comments.

Crowd Energized and Festive, Not Angry or Incited

A while later we saw from a block away that marchers had begun down Constitution Avenue from the Ellipse to Capitol Hill, mostly along Constitution Avenue. We passed down 13th Street to join them.

Although the march was in protest of fraud in the 2020 election and people were recounting the president’s energizing speech, the mood of the crowd was positive and festive. Strangers stopped to talk to one another along the way, resisting but ultimately giving in to offers from street vendors hawking Trump and MAGA memorabilia, or to taking pictures of Washington landmarks.

Some along the way talked enthusiastically about President Trump joining them on Capitol Hill, as if he had said something about it in his Ellipse speech. I didn’t want to pop their balloon by saying that he undoubtedly would not. There was an expectation in the air that he would be there.

Of the thousands of people I passed or who passed me along Constitution Avenue, some were indignant and contemptuous of Congress, but not one appeared angry or incited to riot. Many of the marchers were families with small children; many were elderly, overweight, or just plain tired or frail—traits not typically attributed to the riot-prone.

Some said they were police officers from around the country. Many wore pro-police shirts or carried pro-police “Back the Blue” flags.

Diverse Cross-Section of America

Among the hundreds and hundreds of flags—perhaps thousands—displayed over the next few hours, I saw only two Confederate battle flags and one white supremacist sign, the latter of which some suspected aloud was a leftist plant. The two flags and one sign, I thought, would feature prominently in news reports to present a false image of the crowd.

A large group of African-American men sported shirts that said “Blacks for Trump.” Figuring that journalists would emphasize the solitary racist sign and Confederate flags, deliberately ignoring the rest, I took note of the fact that many demonstrators were black, Asian, and Latino, with a strong presence of Vietnamese- and Chinese-Americans.

Respect for the City and Streets

The DC government had placed only one portable toilet along the 16-block Constitution Avenue route, and five more near the intersection with Pennsylvania Avenue near the Canadian Embassy. The federal government opened the Ronald Reagan Building so people could use the bathrooms.

The city had provided few trash bins. (DC usually provides a large number of toilets and trash receptacles along march routes.) Yet remarkably little litter could be seen in the streets. People crushed their plastic water bottles and food wrappers and stuffed them in their pockets, and a few marchers picked up the occasional trash along the route.

Observations about the toilets and trash are noteworthy because, in my experience with and among large protest crowds in Washington, the large leftist crowds tend to be angry and leave trash in the streets and urine in the shrubs. None of that anger showed in the Jan. 6 crowd along Constitution Avenue.

The Exceptions: Organized Cadre

Although the crowd represented a broad cross-section of Americans, mostly working-class by their appearance and manner of speech, some people stood out. A very few didn’t share the jovial, friendly, earnest demeanor of the great majority. Some obviously didn’t fit in.

Among them were younger twentysomethings wearing new Trump or MAGA hats, often with the visor in the back, showing no enthusiasm and either looking at the ground, glowering, or holding out their phones with outstretched arms to make videos of as many faces as possible in the crowd.

Some appeared awkward, the way someone’s body language inadvertently shows the world that he feel like he doesn’t fit in. A few seemed to be nursing a deep, churning rage.

They generally covered their faces with cloth masks, as opposed to the pro-Trump people, few of whom wore masks at all. They walked, often hands in pockets, in clusters of perhaps four to six with at least one of them frequently looking behind.

These outliers group looked like trouble. I presumed these fake Trump protesters were Antifa or something similar. However, that entire afternoon I saw none of them act aggressively or cause any problems. At least, not from my vantage point.

A second outlier group also stood out. While many marchers wore military camouflage shirts, jackets, or pants of various patterns and states of wear and in all shapes and sizes, here and there one would see people of a different type: Wiry young men in good physical condition dressed neatly in what looked like newer camouflage uniforms with black gear, subdued patches including Punisher skulls, and helmets.

They showed tidiness and discipline. They strode instead of walked, moving at a more rapid pace than most of the people, sometimes breaking into a short jog, and generally keeping to the left side of Constitution Avenue in pairs of two or small groups of three. Unlike others in old military clothes who tended to be affable and talkative, these sullen men seemed not to speak to anyone at all. As we would see, they were the disciplined, uniformed column of attackers.

Entering the U.S. Capitol Grounds

We walked about three blocks behind the front of the march to the Capitol, with perhaps two or three thousand people ahead of us. The DC Metropolitan police were their usual professionally detached selves, standing on curbs or at street crossings and exchanging an occasional greeting from marchers, but treating the event as routine and at the lowest threat level.

When we crossed First Street NW to enter the Capitol grounds where the Capitol Police had jurisdiction, I noticed no police at all. Several marchers expressed surprise.

Passing by a few days earlier, I had noticed that, with presidential inaugural platform construction underway, the Capitol’s West Front lawn had been blocked off with plastic. On this day, there was no barrier blocking the paved footpath with its high granite curbs on either side leading up the Senate side of the hill. The openness seemed like a courtesy gesture from Congress, which controls security.

But that appearance of low threat level made no sense. American flags flew over the Senate and House chambers, indicating that each house of Congress was in session. Vice President Mike Pence was supposed to be there to certify the electoral votes. For better or worse, this was a historic day in Congress. Yet no Capitol Police appeared anywhere from what we could see, and I commented on to my companion that it was very strange for there to be no police during a joint session of Congress, with or without a gigantic crowd.

At a low point of ground, we crossed on top of what looked like a length of black aluminum fencing that had been placed flat over a wet area of mud or dead leaves in the walkway. It was the only thing out of place in what was becoming a funnel of people marching in from the broad merger of the six-lane Constitution Avenue and four-lane Pennsylvania Avenue and a Senate staff parking lot and park to the footpath. What looked like tens or even hundreds of thousands of people surged down the avenues as far as one could see.

At the West Front of the Capitol: Spirited Disorder

The marchers became denser as greater numbers of people funneled into the paved footpath going up Capitol Hill, but almost everyone seemed talkative and happy. The path was interrupted by a few steps and a handrail in the middle, going on until a second set of steps ended at a plaza at the Capitol’s crypt level.

The first thing we saw was the temporary news media tower built for cameras to transmit the upcoming presidential inauguration. As if at a party, some younger Trump supporters had climbed the tower and were waving American and political flags.

The tower stood before the painted wooden inaugural stand itself, with its VIP section above the balcony-like protrusion where Joe Biden will be sworn in as president. Windbreaks or something similar, made of metal scaffolding and covered with a façade of white cloth or plastic sheeting, rose above the north and south ends of the platform.

No police could be seen on the platform for now. No police could be seen anywhere.

People kept surging in from Constitution Avenue, and the plaza quickly filled up and overflowed onto the lawn. Everyone squeezed closer and closer together, with most in high spirits. Some trouble began up in the front, near the base of the inaugural platform itself, but we could not see what was happening.

Many of us looked on our phones for texts or Twitter messages to find out what was happening, but there was no functioning wireless service—too many people with phones in too small an area overloaded the cell phone transmission facilities.

The Capitol Police

The U.S. Capitol Police recruit a special kind of professional. They are sworn to defend one of the most important building complexes in the country, the U.S. Capitol and its sprawling congressional office buildings. More importantly, their mission is to defend one of the three coequal branches of the federal government, upholding the Constitution.

Every day they deal with thousands of tourists and visitors from around the country and the world. They have to be serious with their mission, but constantly show patience with the often frustrating and even annoying throngs of ordinary visitors and those who consider themselves Very Important People.

Normally, the Capitol Police are excellent at communicating with crowds. Not today.

A contingent of perhaps 30 to 50 Capitol Police emerged at the top of the inaugural platform above the VIP section and worked their way down to the spot where Biden will take his oath of office. It was after 1:17 p.m., according to my camera. They were armed with paintball-type long guns that fired capsules of pepper irritant, teargas launchers, and long guns that I could not identify from my position. Something was happening on the plaza level below them, but we couldn’t see.

To our left on the Senate side, a scuffle had already broken out, but we were so packed so tightly that we couldn’t see or hear. The biggest feature was the imposing edifice of the Capitol itself, the party-like guys up on the camera tower, and the endless crowd of people flowing in with colorful flags—American, MAGA, South Vietnamese, even one from Kazakhstan. Many eyes were on the Capitol police in their black tactical gear, bright yellow-green safety vests, and weapons.

Some out-of-towners wondered why the police were there when they were all pro-police and no Antifa were present. Others said they did see Antifa wearing backward MAGA hats, so the police must have been waiting for them. I quietly wondered why so few police were present for a crowd this or any size.

Confusion as Police Fire Tear Gas at Their Supporters

Then something happened at the front of the crowd, as if a champagne cork popped to release pent-up human energy. It seemed like a scuffle, but from 40 feet back, I couldn’t see. People started chanting “USA, USA,” and other slogans. Some burst with streams of profanity about Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and “the steal.”

For a few seconds I saw what looked like police in a tussle with some of the marchers up front—what appeared to be an organized group in civilian clothes. This organized group are the cell I call the “plainclothes militants.” They fit right in with the MAGA people.

Suddenly energy surged from the front of the crowd as the anti-riot police, above on the inaugural platform, visibly tensed up. Some sighted their pepper ball weapons toward the densely packed people. One fired a teargas canister—not at the plainclothes militants at the front line, but into the crowd itself. Then another. Flash grenades went off in the middle of the crowd.

I had seen anti-riot police in action before. They moved with a decisive sense of purpose. Now, the Capitol Police crew seemed confused, as if without a leader or perhaps inadequate rules of engagement. These professionals seemed directionless.

Some clambered up and down the inaugural platform steps. Others milled back and forth at the swearing-in level. Most of the police ended up leaving the surreal scene. Nobody could tell why.

Pro-Police People Felt Like They Were Being Attacked

No bullhorn or sound system could be heard for the police to communicate with the swelling mass of people.

The tear gas changed the crowd’s demeanor. There was an air of disbelief as people realized that the police whom they supported were firing on them. “What are you doing—we support you,” someone yelled. Tear gas wafted through the crowd, a low-grade irritant, fortunately, as if to send a warning to disperse. But nobody could disperse; some tried to leave the area, but more kept flowing in from Constitution Avenue, making evacuation impossible.

All of a sudden, pro-police people felt the police were attacking them, and they didn’t know why. Instead of running away, the people stood their ground.

Something seemed to break loose a second time toward the front, but we couldn’t tell what it was. Younger members of the crowd climbed the scaffolding inside the north façade of the inaugural platform and waved flags from the top. The crowd cheered.

More tear gas. A canister struck a girl in the face, drawing blood. The pro-police crowd went from disbelief and confusion to anger. A few dozen members of the crowd, mostly young men, raced up a narrow path on the stone steps behind the façade and a limestone wall, facing a few police at the top, who tried to stop them.

The police disappeared and a crowd surged up the stairs to the plaza at the Senate entry level. People inside the façade tore through to wave flags. As another canister of tear gas went off, a few people started pushing against the current of incoming marchers to leave the area.

Provocateurs to Turn Unsuspecting Marchers Into an Invading Mob

Then, a loud, bellowing shout from behind: “Forward! Do not retreat! Forward!”

Retreat? Nobody was retreating. They were trying to escape the tear gas. But the man kept yelling not to “retreat,” as if this were a military operation. In a powerful voice, he exhorted the crowd to remain on the plaza and not to disperse on the lawn or depart down the steps to the footpath. Thousands more people continued pouring in from Constitution Avenue.

Then two other men, standing across from one another on the high granite curbs on either side of the footpath, bellowed variations of “Forward! Don’t you dare retreat!” Some made direct eye contact at people and pointed directly at them, as if trying to psyche them into submitting.

Still more tear gas, this time with green or yellow smoke. I was concerned that my companion, who was recovering from a previously injured foot, might get knocked down if people started to stampede for air. Once someone falls down in a panicked crowd, there’s a dangerous risk of getting trampled to death. I opened the way for others to exit, with other marchers lending a hand. But most of the people stood where they were as more marchers flowed up Capitol Hill.

A third man standing on a chair, also shouting “Forward,” reached down to grab me by the shoulder and barked, “Don’t retreat! Get back up there!” It wasn’t an expression of enthusiasm or solidarity; it sounded like a military order. And it wasn’t from a wild kid; this guy was probably in his 50s. He looked furious with me.

What did he care what I did? What difference would the departure of ten or even a hundred of us make, with so many more surging in. The furious man crouched down and yelled in my face: “We’re going into the Capitol!” I ignored him, broke away, and worked my way down the steps.

“What a stupid idiot,” I thought. “You can’t just walk into the Capitol anymore. Especially not today.” Bystanders helped my companion and me mount the high stone curb to the grass, where we chatted with new people we met and wondered what was happening up front.

What the barking men were doing didn’t hit me until later, when we found out about the attack: They appeared to be part of an organized cell of agents-provocateurs to corral people as an unwitting follow-on force behind the plainclothes militants tussling with police—but who, we would later learn, were actually breaking into the Capitol beneath the Great Rotunda to storm Congress. It was just before 3 o’clock.

These apparent agents-provocateurs placed hundreds of unsuspecting supporters of the president in physical danger. They attempted to block exits for people seeking to escape tear gas. They endangered vulnerable people, including children, the frail, and the elderly.

They funneled and pushed hundreds if not thousands of innocent people into a crush toward the Capitol. They did so with the goal of forcing those people into a confrontation with federal police defending Congress.

Surreal Pandemonium

Nobody seemed aware that the Capitol was physically under attack. The tear gas caused pandemonium. But there was still no stampede, and people helped create or widen paths to allow others to leave the area.

Some, seeing frail or elderly people who had a hard time standing, broke into a pallet of black folding chairs for the inauguration and distributed them. But the mood had gone from patriotic—although contemptuous of Congress—to furious.

Rumors spread. “They say they’re going into the Congress,” someone said. “Good,” someone else said, perhaps more as an exclamation of anger at being teargassed than anything else. “That’s stupid. Cops will never let ‘em in,” said others, or in words to that effect.

Some blamed House Speaker Pelosi for ordering the police to gas her political opponents, then wondered aloud whether she really could do that. Somebody was able to get phone reception to ask if anybody knew what was happening, but couldn’t hear because of the crowd. Texting and social media posting was almost nonexistent because of overloaded towers.

Having spent decades around the Capitol since my days as a junior Senate and House staffer, and loving the building and its history as one of our greatest national treasures, I was confident that the Capitol would remain safe. But the lack of perimeter police presence, and the confused actions of those firing tear gas, flash grenades, and pepper balls from the presidential swearing-in platform had me thinking that something was wrong at the command level.

What if someone did break into the Capitol? Not possible. From out there on the lawn, a breakdown in police command and control was unthinkable.

By now, where we were on the Senate lawn, the mood was more like an outdoor rock concert gone out of control. Someone with a master key took control of a green cherry-picker, raising two people on the crane, who took pictures and waved.

Others kept people back to prevent injuries. Conscientious people looked out for the unaware or foolish. Several young people scaled the basement wall of the Senate to join people who had taken the steps to the top.

For the first time we saw a group of journalists with their cameras, computers, and transmitting gear. A few Capitol Police milled around, some winded as if they had seen action.

Uniformed, Disciplined Cadre Assembles for Attack

Then, from the north, a column of uniformed, agile younger men walked briskly, single-file, toward the inaugural stand. They came within two feet of me. Their camouflage uniforms were clean, neat, and with a pattern I couldn’t identify.

Some had helmets and GoPro cameras. Some uniforms bore subdued insignia, including the Punisher skull. These were the disciplined, uniformed column of attackers. I had seen them in groups of two or three among the marchers on Connecticut Avenue from the Ellipse.

Now there were a good three dozen of them, moving in a single, snakelike formation. They were organized. They were disciplined. They were prepared.

“We’re taking the Capitol!” the first or second announced.

“You’re gonna get arrested,” someone called out.

“They can arrest some of us, but not all of us,” another member of the uniformed contingent shouted to no one in particular.

A few curious younger people left their friends to follow them as the group disappeared under the scaffolding beneath the Rotunda entrance.

Some in the crowd expressed frustrated hope the uniformed men could teach Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a lesson, but nobody seemed to believe that they would actually do it.

I tried to text a friend to report what was happening. The jammed cell phone system made it impossible.

Spectacle of the Weird on the East Front

A small group of us exited toward Constitution Avenue, north of the Senate Wing. Someone said he had seen a person inside a second-floor window holding a “Stop the Steal” sign.

“They got into the House and Senate,” someone told us. “It’s crazy.”

A circus awaited us on the East Front of the Senate Wing. At the foot of the Senate steps, a victorious-looking crowd stood there, hanging around. A semi-naked man in what looked like a fur caveman outfit, with a Braveheart-painted face and Viking horns, struck a weirdly heroic pose as people took pictures.

The crowd there was different. People were talking about how the Capitol had been invaded. A rumor spread that “the cops shot and killed a woman inside.” The rumors were true.

We wanted to stay but decided against it. As we passed by the fountain that formed the glass roof of the visitors’ center below, several dozen Capitol Police, wearing anti-riot body armor and holding transparent shields, accompanied by what looked like DC anti-riot police and about a dozen DC National Guardsmen, walked past us in irregular formation, heading toward the Capitol building.

Some seemed winded, as if they had been in an incident, perhaps where we had been on the other side of the Senate. One officer stayed behind to help a brother policeman, who seemed to have trouble walking; a mask obscured his face but his skin looked swollen and red. He kept on walking.

We didn’t know what to say or do. It didn’t seem real, but it was. The time was 3:32 p.m. We went home in silence.

‘We Just Wanted Our Voices To Be Heard.’ Capitol Protesters Speak Out,"Why did hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country show up in Washington, D.C., last week to protest the presidential election? What were all those people doing there, and what did they hope to accomplish?

The corporate press, Big Tech monopolists, Democrats, and quite a few Republicans and right-of-center media outlets aren’t at all interested in those questions. They don’t care. To them, the people who rallied in support of President Trump last Wednesday and marched to the U.S. Capitol—whether or not they took part in the violence—are nothing more than traitors.

It doesn’t matter that the vast majority didn’t so much as jostle a barrier, let alone smash a window or throw a punch. Didn’t you hear? Those people tried to stage a coup. Trump incited them. They’re terrorists and insurrectionists, and all we need to know about them is where they live and who they work for.

That’s how you respond to the horrible events of Jan. 6 if you want to deepen the divisions in America and make it impossible to live together in peace. But if you want to fix what’s wrong and salvage our broken republic, you at least have to try and understand why so many Trump supporters gathered at the U.S. Capitol last week. And yes, you can do that without condoning or excusing the idiots who attacked the police.

That’s not hard to do, although the left has had trouble with it this year. When it was Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists demonstrating and rioting in the streets and attacking police, corporate journalists churned out essays and commentary that either tacitly or explicitly endorsed the violence, while insisting that we understand and sympathize with the ideology and outrage fueling it. Some argued that we must kneel, literally, and profess BLM dogma, or be branded a racist.

By contrast, almost no one has insisted that we understand or sympathize with the cause of the peaceful protesters who marched to the capitol, to say nothing of the people themselves. So I decided to talk to some of them.

‘I’m Shocked to The Core’

Jaron Pensinger, a 21-year-old student at Georgetown University, told me he went to the protest for two reasons: to voice his opposition to what he believes are unjustifiable pandemic lockdowns, and to raise awareness about mail-in ballot fraud in the November election.

“I’m concerned that the Democrats actually changed and loosened election laws over the summer and made them less stringent,” he said. “So now more than ever we should be investigating fraud, and I felt like the Democratic Party just swept it under the rug and didn’t want to investigate anything.”

Pensinger specifically asked me to use his name because his school newspaper, The Hoya, ran a hit piece on him this week, badly mischaracterizing his presence at the protests, which the paper described as a “coup attempt,” and associating him with the violence that broke out at the U.S. Capitol.

Pensinger attended the protest with two other Georgetown students, and he says they were caught “completely unaware” when they saw from a distance people pushing against police barricades, because the vast majority of the protesters—hundreds of thousands of them—were peacefully demonstrating. He says that where he was on the capitol grounds, he didn’t see anyone so much as cross a security barrier.

“We were just peacefully assembling,” he said. “And I assumed that this was going to be a completely peaceful statement to our government that we would like more investigation into the election and perhaps stop with these covid lockdowns.” Pensinger says he’s “shocked to the core” that anyone would portray it as an attempted coup or an insurrection.

‘We Had A Civic Duty to Our Country to Attend’

Not everyone wanted to speak on the record, for fear of harassment and threats. Another college student I talked to drove six hours with her mother to attend the rally and protest. She said she felt she had “a civic duty to our country to attend,” given the “substantial evidence of voter fraud and irregularities.”

“We want to stand up and show that we’re following the news and we’re reading between the lines,” she said. “I think the mainstream media has largely failed to report upon very concerning evidence of voter fraud. And really we just wanted our voices to be heard.”

She says the crowd around her, both at the White House Ellipse where Trump spoke and when she and her mother marched to the U.S. Capitol grounds, was “calm and respectful,” and that there were a lot of young families with babies, elderly couples, and military veterans in uniform. One group had traveled all the way from Hawaii to be there.

This student and her mother decided to go back to their hotel to charge their phones and rest before coming back later that evening, but as soon as they left the area, she starting getting texts that “they stormed the capitol, somehow they got into the capitol.” At that point, she heard sirens and saw police cars speeding toward the capitol, so they decided not to go back.

Like Pensinger and every other person I spoke to, they obeyed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser’s 6 p.m. curfew that night and stayed in their hotel rooms—an odd thing for “insurrectionists” to do. She never expected the protest to turn violent: “I absolutely did not intend to enter the capitol, I obviously did not enter the capitol, and if anyone would have told me on Tuesday or Wednesday morning that others had that intention, I would have just laughed.”

‘I Didn’t Have Any Delusions of Grandeur’

So, far from being the launch-point of an insurrection, much of what was planned for last Wednesday was orderly and ordinary—permitted groups planning events and speakers at the capitol grounds to draw attention to election fraud and irregularities that were ignored or dismissed by the corporate press.

One such event organizer was Nathan Martin, an Iraq War veteran and city councilman in Shelby, Ohio. His group had obtained a permit from the Capitol Police, along with a bunch of other groups that planned events for that day. “We went through all the steps,” he said.

As for the march to the capitol grounds, “We didn’t think it would change the outcome” of the election. Martin’s hope was that Republican lawmakers would put their objections on the record and go through the claims of election fraud, “line by line,” especially claims in states where instances of fraud and election irregularities were well-documented.

“That’s it. I didn’t have any delusions of grandeur that Vice President Pence would come swooping in and change the results or anything like that,” he said. “Although there had been some constitutional talk about whether that was allowed or not, I didn’t feel constitutionally that there was room for that.” At best, Martin says he was hoping for an election commission to look into fraud, and that maybe some good would come from that.

After Trump spoke, Martin went back to his hotel to get some supplies for their planned event. When he returned, he at first saw no signs that anything was amiss or that any part of the capitol security had been breached (and because there was no cell service, he didn’t know about the violent clashes with police).

He was walking around the capitol grounds looking for his parents, who had driven down from Pennsylvania because they “wanted to pray over the capitol grounds and pray for our country,” when he saw some people going into the capitol through a side door. That didn’t seem quite right to him. A short time later, he says, the metro police showed up, “And it was at that point I realized that, you know what, I’m going to go back to my hotel.”

Back at the hotel, he learned what had happened. “All of our objectives, everything that we wanted to achieve, was destroyed in a matter of hours,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to get an election integrity commission. I don’t think we’re going to get accountability or really fully know what happened.”

‘It Just Incensed Me’

Not everyone I talked to was opposed to civil disobedience or pushing past security barriers at the capitol. One man, a 62-year-old software engineer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from his employer, told me he hadn’t planned to force his way into the U.S. Capitol or break any rules. But in the moment, something changed.

Initially, he’d hoped that the sight of a mass demonstration on the capitol grounds would give “weak-knee Republicans” the courage to “stand up and save our country.” He thought there was a last-ditch chance that GOP lawmakers would be able to force a vote on electors in the House, by state delegation.

Once he got to the capitol itself, he didn’t see anyone fighting with police or throwing objects, but he did see people pushing and pulling on the barriers. He and a friend were pretty far back, he says, so they walked around to an open area on the south side of the complex where he encountered a flimsy fence and a sign that said “No Entry Beyond This Point.” Beyond that were a few Capitol Police, just standing around.

“When I saw that I just kind of got—mad is not the right word, but I just got indignant, you know?” He says after nine of months of rioting and mayhem in U.S. cities, supported by Democrats and the media, the authorities at the capitol just assumed that pro-Trump protesters would obey the rules and do as they were told.

He told me, “I walked up to that [barrier] and said, ‘These people want me to keep off the grass and stay behind their barriers and obey the rules?’ And it just incensed me. I just couldn’t believe these people. So I start pushing and pulling on the stupid barrier at that point, I said, ‘I’m going in there.’ But it didn’t last long.”

He says a capitol police officer was walking down the line with a big canister of liquid pepper spray and dousing anyone who jostled the barrier, and he got hit full in the face. His friend pulled him back and it took him hours to recover. He never made it into the capitol.

Even if he had, though, he says goal wasn’t to hurt anyone or stage a coup, or anything of the sort. It was to make a statement.

Our civil disobedience is, we’re going to walk into this building and wave the American flag. That’s what I felt like everybody who was around me, that’s what their attitude was. It wasn’t beating up officers, it wasn’t tearing things down or destroying. It was, that’s our building and we’re gonna go in there and wave the American flag. And if it puts a little fear of God into those people, I could care less.

Not everyone will agree with that view. I don’t. But I do understand it. It makes sense to me that some people, even law-abiding software engineers in their sixties, might get so fed up with the hypocrisy and contempt shown to them by our ruling class that they decide they’re going to break a few rules, push past a few barriers, and make their voices heard.

The vast majority of the protesters didn’t quite get there. But they did get to the point where they were willing to travel across the country to protest what they believe, not without good reason, was an unfair election. Far from being insurrectionist, theirs is a quintessentially American impulse—and the news media would have said as much if the protesters, and even the rioters, had been left-wing activists objecting to a Trump victory.

But they weren’t. So no one in the press or the halls of power will ever say a sympathetic word about them. They’ll be shunned from polite society and branded as traitors and terrorists and conspiracy theorists. They’ll be kicked off social media and mocked by cable news. If they have podcasts or YouTube channels, those will be shut down. Some of them will even be fired from their jobs and harassed in the street for nothing more than expressing a political opinion.

But they won’t go away.

How The Swamp Fulfilled Trump's Dream To Crack Down On Riots,"WASHINGTON — For six months, President Donald Trump pushed for a harsher crackdown on the riots raging across the United States, facing constant pushback from officials worried that would further inflame the chaos and lead to needless death. As Joe Biden takes the oath of office and Trump exits Washington, the outgoing president’s dream is finally realized — ironically, too late to change a thing.

Over the past week, somewhere between 15 and 25,000 troops have taken to the streets of Washington. Together with the police, they have formed an approximately 11-mile perimeter around the president-elect and members of Congress, even blockading the bridges to Virginia (although it’s unclear what happens if the rebel army takes the open roads from Maryland). Checkpoints are manned, guardsmen are vetted, and panicked “insurrection” disinformation is bandied about the corporate media like so many sparkles in the wind.

This is what a state of emergency looks like. Except when it isn’t.

This is not what it looked like in the streets of Kenosha, where rioters terrorized residents and business owners for four straight nights. Nor is it what it looked like in the streets of Chicago, where police drew up the bridges to the once-glittering Magnificent Mile.

Twenty-five thousand troops did not descend on St. Louis, where four policemen were wounded and retired Police Chief David Dorn was gunned down. Little help came for the 140 federal officers who were injured while the federal courthouse was besieged in Portland, Oregon.

The ironies of Inauguration Day’s show of force stack high. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, for example, thanked Guardsmen for their “commitment to our American democracy” during a recent photo-op — just six months after she called called federal agents fighting the courthouse riots “unidentified stormtroopers” whose deployment shamed “a democratic republic.”

When it’s your community vs. when it’s their community pic.twitter.com/A9EmbCz9YX — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 16, 2021

The New York Times reported unblinkingly on the number of Guardsmen in the Capitol just eight months after Editorial Page Director James Bennet and his deputy were forced to resign for running a senator’s call to “send in the military” to restore order.

The most striking of all ironies, however, is the one befalling our outgoing president. Unable to convince his deputies to clamp down on disorder while in power, he now leaves a city occupied to cheers in honor of his successor (and his successor’s Army).

Law and order is an issue Trump campaigned on. The elites, he told voters, have walls and security yet seek to take guns and police protection away from the citizenry. He was right. Yet since late May, America has been subjected to images of burning cities and besieged federal officers while accusations of fascism blow forth like bubbles from media and Democratic microphones. Law and order, it seems, this administration was not.

The long fight between Trump, who demanded a muscular federal response to the unrest, and his top advisers, led by Attorney General Bill Barr, is documented in a Monday article by Johnathan Swan:

From his seat behind the Resolute Desk, an agitated Trump told Barr to go and do something, and to do it right away — make an announcement, send in the troops, something. Just go in and resolve it, the president ordered. He wanted a devastating and provocative show of strength. Barr disagreed. He thought the heat in the protests was gradually easing. He explained law enforcement strategy and his opinion that military intervention would backfire. Federal investigators were already hunting for the ringleaders in the protests.

Barr was mainly concerned the troops would have two choices: act (and people might die) or stand down (and authorities would look weak). Neither, he believed, was desirable.

His concerns were not foolish ones. Antifa and Black Lives Matter intentionally provoke authorities, seeing it as win-win for their cause. If no reaction comes, it shows the rioters are in charge. If authorities execute a crackdown, the riot’s leaders bet they can use the crackdown to prove the police are oppressing them; and there’s little doubt deploying force would have led to death.

But when riots go unpunished, violence reigns anyway. Between George Floyd’s death and Election Day, 25 American lives were extinguished in the chaos.

Over those six months, the rioters (or are they insurrectionists now?) attacked the White House, federal courthouses, police stations, a U.S. senator, and a mother trying to drive home with her child, and even killed an eight-year-old. Corporate media did their part, romanticizing it all as a “protest for racial justice.”

All that romance and talk of fascism ended with the Jan. 6 riot, when more than half a year of intensifying political street violence culminated in a right-wing assault on the U.S. Capitol.

While the sergeant at arms and Democratic mayor of D.C. had turned down repeated requests for National Guard reinforcements, they escaped blame for the the Capitol Police’s ineptitude in repelling the deadly riot, and tearful BLM rioters took to the airwaves to talk of how their crime sprees were oppressed while the MAGA rioters were treated with kid gloves. Nevermind the dead woman or the dozens of nationwide arrest warrants issued after Jan. 6 — if the rioters had been black, activists claimed, even more would be dead.

As tens of thousands of soldiers deployed to protect Biden, the media applauded, Pelosi took pictures, and Washington was pleased with itself. This, you see, was an emergency. Finally, things could be normal.

It’s easy to imagine the law-and-order women of the suburbs who abandoned the president’s re-elect in droves nodding along in contented agreement at capital streets cleared of “insurrection.” The Capitol was no mere White House or federal courthouse, no entrepreneur’s life dream or loving grandfather left to bleed out in the street. This was a sacred symbol of America, and Biden will protect it for us.

It’s a pity it took an attack on America’s elites in their own offices to finally get here. The inauguration — and its participants — might look very different if Trump’s orders had been carried out in the first place.

59: White House Suggests Republicans, Not Democrats, Tried To Defund The Police

After last year’s summer of rage, Jen Psaki suggested that Republicans, not Democrats, were trying to defund the police.

“Part of his announcement is also ensuring their specific guidance to communities across the country to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American jobs plan that was supported, that was voted into law by Democrats, just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police,” Psaki concluded during a White House press briefing.

Psaki’s comments come after a year of leftist-led crusades to “defund the police” after the death of George Floyd.

Biden acknowledged the left’s quest to remove power from policing but warned civil rights leaders in December that it was the ‘defund the police’ push that granted Republicans victories in many down-ballot races on Nov. 3.

“That’s how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we’re talking about defunding the police,” Biden said in a leaked call.

58: Biden Says Corporate Media Reporters Are The Smartest People In The Entire Country

President Joe Biden told reporters on Wednesday following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin that he thinks they’re the smartest people in the entire country.

“You all are some of the brightest people in the country,” Biden said. “I mean it, I’m not being solicitous. But it makes no sense for me to negotiate with you!”

Biden’s affirmations for his Democrat cronies in the corporate media came minutes after he told the CNN White House Correspondent she was in the wrong business, and lobbed insults at the press pool for “never” asking a positive question.

Just a few weeks ago, reporters fawned over Biden as he munched on a chocolate chocolate chip ice cream cone.

57: Biden Repeats Lie That Rioters Killed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick

During a press conference following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden once again repeated the lie that the Jan. 6 rioters killed a Capitol police officer.

“It’s one thing for literally criminals to break through [sic], go into the Capitol, kill a police officer, and be held unaccountable and than it is for people objecting, marching on the Capitol and saying ‘you are not allowing me to speak freely. You’re not allowing me to do A, B, C, or D.’ And so they’re very different criteria.”

While the White House continues to tout Officer Brian Sicknick’s death as a reason to condemn Capitol rioters, the Washington D.C. chief medical examiner revealed in April that Sicknick, who died on Jan. 7, suffered two strokes and died of natural causes later at the hospital. The report followed months of erroneous coverage promoted and propelled by corrupt corporate media institutions and Democrats.

Biden’s false claim follows a deflection from Putin who mentioned the Jan. 6 riot and Ashli Babbitt’s death in response to a reporter who asked why many of his own political opponents are are “dead, imprisoned, or jailed.” Biden called Putin’s comparison “ridiculous.”

56: Biden Keeps Saying That The Economy Was Tanking Before He Arrived At The White House

Throughout his campaign for congressional Democrats to jam his expensive infrastructure proposal through both chambers, Biden has repeatedly claimed that the economy was tanking before he arrived in the White House.

“Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin,” Biden said last week.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Biden uttered these words eight days after his own Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real gross domestic product ‘increased at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021.'”

Biden claims his infrastructure plan will be good for the U.S. and even potentially stimulate the economy but as noted by The Tax Foundation, federal spending costs will eventually outweigh the benefits for Americans.

“We estimate the infrastructure spending would increase long-run GDP by 0.3 percent, but this positive economic effect is entirely offset by the increase in corporate taxation, resulting in less corporate investment which reduces GDP by 0.5 percent in the long run, reduces wages by 0.5 percent, and eliminates 101,000 full-time equivalent jobs,” the Tax Foundation’s analysis of The American Jobs Plan suggests.

55: Biden Repeats Claim Capitol Riot Days Before Inauguration Was Worst Assault On Capital Since Civil War

While demanding a 9/11-style commission to study the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden appeared to forget about 9/11 altogether.

Speaking to reporters outside a Cleveland-area ice cream parlor, Biden repeated his claim the riot was “the greatest assault since the Civil War on the capital.”

But at any rate, I came for ice cream."" pic.twitter.com/gT1hI7mRL3 — DJ Judd (@DJJudd) May 27, 2021

On Sept. 11, 2001 however, 125 people died instantly with 64 passengers on a plane flown into the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda terrorists. Only one person died at the 2021 riot at the Capitol when they were shot by security.

54: Psaki Claims ‘Number Of Officers’ Died On Day Of Capitol Riot. Zero Did.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a May 21 briefing that a “number of officers lost their lives” on the day of the January Capitol riot.

“Obviously, the president’s view is that a number of officers who lost their lives paid a tremendous sacrifice on a day that will be a stain on our democracy for many years to come,” Psaki said.

That number of officers, however, is zero.

While Democrats, in their second Trump impeachment, pointed to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick’s death the day after the riot based on a debunked report in the New York Times, the D.C. medical examiner concluded in April that the officer died of natural causes.

53: Biden Appears to Make up Amtrak Story

At a 50th-anniversary event for Amtrak in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden said that when he was vice president, a train conductor congratulated him for traveling 1.5 million miles on Amtrak. A Fox News report out on May 5, however, pokes holes in the president’s account.

“When I became vice president, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career,” Biden said. “I think that’s an exaggeration. I’m going to rely on those two conductors. … One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri.”

Biden continued, telling the audience Negri estimated Biden had traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak trains around his fourth or fifth year as vice president, which would have been in 2013 or 2014.

“My mom was sick, and I used to try to come home almost every weekend as vice president to see her,” Biden said. “I got on the train and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ‘Joey, baby,’ and he grabbed my cheek like he always did. … He said, ‘Joey, what’s the big deal? One-point-three million miles on Air Force Two? Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?’ I said, ‘No, Angie, I don’t know.’ He gave me the calculation and he said you traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak.”

As Fox News pointed out, however, an obituary for Negri says the conductor retired in 1993, decades before Biden’s supposed story took place, while he was still a senator from Delaware. Biden’s mother died in 2010.

52: White House Says Trump Admin Spurred Border Crisis

Psaki said Trump created “an immigration system rooted in destructive and chaotic policies” that spurred the border crisis.

“Our administration immediately jumped into action to address the influx of migrants at the border, something that began during and was exacerbated by the Trump administration,” Psaki said.

.@PressSec says that the influx of immigrants at the southern border is ""something that began during and was something that was exacerbated by the Trump administration."" pic.twitter.com/iacLlRwxVg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 4, 2021

While apprehensions under Trump’s leadership did begin increasing in fall 2020, border crossings surged during the first few months of Biden’s presidency. Not only did U.S. Customs and Border Protection take more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, but data also shows increases between February and March forced the CBP to stretch its chart to accommodate the largest numbers it has seen in at least two decades.

51: Biden Claims $1.8 Trillion American Families Plan Won’t Add to Deficit

Biden claimed in Virginia on May 3 while promoting the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan that the Democrats’ latest behemoth wish-list bill “doesn’t add a single penny to our deficit.”

“It’s paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share,” Biden said.

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, the plan “includes $1.5 trillion of offsets, resulting in a $300 billion net deficit impact over a decade.”

50: Biden Says Anyone Making Less Than $400k Doesn’t Have to Pay Taxes

Biden said that anyone making less than $400,000 a year doesn’t have to pay taxes.

“Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes,” the Democrat said. “And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.”

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1389279329335529476?s=20

Biden’s words may be a gaffe, but even experts agree that his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year is ambitious and not realistic. Even if the Democrats concentrate on “taxing the rich,” those who fall below the $400,000 mark are subject to consequences from a highly taxed economy.

49: Biden Blames Trump for the Border Crisis (Again)

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed that the “one god-awful mess at the border” was created by the Trump administration.

“Hey, look, here’s what happened – the failure to have a real transition. The two departments that didn’t give us access to virtually anything were the immigration [department] and the Defense Department. So, we didn’t find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably,” Biden said.

This statement, Former Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said, is false.

“At the Department of Homeland Security, we provided the transition team with more than 200 extensive briefings on homeland security issues, the majority of which dealt with the border, immigration policy, and the processes and procedures we had in place to secure the border and reduce asylum fraud. … During the transition, the incoming Biden administration was made fully aware of the consequences of undoing the effective policies that had fixed the previous crisis and driven illegal crossings down substantially,” he said.

Biden is quick to shift the negative media coverage of the disaster at the border to his predecessor, but Trump is not responsible for the thousands of people crossing the border. Not only have the number of illegal aliens surged to record highs since Biden assumed office, but migrants have admitted that the reason they came is that they knew the Biden administration wouldn’t turn them or their families away. Even though illegal migrants may be hopeful about a future in the U.S., Biden and his team are struggling to keep up with housing the aliens in safe and clean conditions.

48: Biden Claims the Border Is ‘Under Control’

Despite his belief that Trump created the border crisis, Biden falsely claimed that it is “getting urgent action now.”

“For example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn’t be, and controlled by the Border Patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically,” Biden said in an interview with NBC News.

As noted by Heritage, even if the “number of unaccompanied minors in Customs and Border Protection custody has decreased, the numbers are clear: most of those minors are simply being transferred from one government agency to another — in this CBP custody to the Department of Health and Human Services.”

47: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Adequately Plan for Border Crisis

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed the Trump administration did not plan for the border crisis.

“For example, we have — they didn’t plan for, which it comes every year, this flow, whether it is 22,000 or 10,000, they didn’t have the beds that were available. They didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kids from the Border Patrol and put them in beds where there was security and there were that people who could take care of them. So, there is a significant change right now, a significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border,” he said.

As noted by Former Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, “This is an outrageous claim.”

“In November 2020, CBP under the Trump administration had fewer than 800 unaccompanied alien children, family units, and single adults in custody. In March of this year, that number had exploded to more than 10,000. Even though apprehensions started increasing in 2020, as growing numbers of illegal migrants gambled on a potential Biden election victory and subsequent amnesty, the Trump administration had strong policies in place to quickly and responsibly process and deport most of these individuals. This meant there was no systemic issue with backlogs or overcrowded CBP or HHS facilities,” Morgan said.

46: Biden Claims His Administration Has Control of the Border Crisis

In an interview with NBC’s Craig Melvin on “Today,” Biden falsely claimed his administration successfully reigned in the southern border crisis.

“It’s way down now, we’ve now gotten control,” Biden said.

“Do not send your kids, period. … they're in jeopardy going, making that 1000-mile trek.” -President Biden’s message to parents sending their children across the border pic.twitter.com/stHHQeUiWl — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 30, 2021

Instead of facing the fact that U.S. Customs and Border Protection took more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, making it the busiest month for the agency in more than 20 years, Biden blamed the previous administration for not preparing for the influx exacerbated by Democrat rhetoric.

“They didn’t plan for, which comes every year, this flow, whether it’s 22,000 or 10,000,” Biden said. “They didn’t have the beds that were available, they didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kid from the border patrol and put them in beds where there’s security and there were people that could take care of them.”

Biden promised that the White House and other federal agencies are taking “urgent action now,” a record-breaking 18,890 unaccompanied teens and children have been packed into overcrowded shelters plagued by COVID-19 spread and “dangerous” conditions for longer than the 72-hour limit permitted by federal law.

45: Biden Says Banning ‘Assault Weapons’ Reduced Gun Violence and Mass Shootings

Biden said that former President Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons contributed to the decline in gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years in his joint address.

“A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds … we beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years,” Biden said.

President Biden once again touts the lie that former President Clinton's ban on ""assault weapons"" reduced gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years. Rep. @laurenboebert knows this is false. You can read @KatiePavlich's fact-check on the claim here: https://t.co/ALfjLcD7UM pic.twitter.com/1zCgpJ6MMN — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 29, 2021

As noted by Townhall’s Katie Pavlich, a 2004 University of Pennsylvania Center of Criminology study funded by the Department of Justice found that the “ban cannot be credited with a decrease in violence carried out with firearms.”

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

Biden’s claim that semiautomatic rifles with “high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds … can be fired off in seconds” is also disputed. While a semiautomatic rifle may be able to fire off 100 rounds in less than a minute, speechwriters chose to use “seconds,” which implies a smaller timeframe than what is actually required to go through that much ammo.

President Biden is about to lie to the American people about guns. Again. My favorite here is the blatant lie that ""high capacity magazines"" enable semi-automatic rifles to fire 100 rounds in seconds. It's just not true.https://t.co/nIeYNXhF9L — Amy Swearer (@AmySwearer) April 29, 2021

44: Biden Brags That COVID Spending Bill Was Bipartisan Effort. It Wasn’t.

During his first address to a joint session of Congress, Biden said his $1.9 trillion COVID spending bill was a bipartisan effort.

“What else have we done in those first 100 days? We kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door,” Biden said.

No Republicans, however, voted for the bill, which was jammed through the Democrat-controlled Congress using budget reconciliation. While Biden met with members of the GOP about the legislation to discuss changes, he ultimately refused to compromise on its price.

43: Biden Claims Jan. 6 Riot ‘Worst Attack on Our Democracy Since the Civil War’

Biden claimed in his first State of the Union address before Congress that the Jan. 6 riot was “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”

By the death toll, however, the United States has seen far worse.

Five died who were present at the riot, four of whom through natural causes, including the Capitol police officer whose death was weaponized by Democrats to impeach then-President Donald Trump. One Capitol rioter was killed by a police officer.

The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, killed nearly 3,000 people after two commercial airliners flew into the New York’s World Trade Center buildings, one into the Pentagon, and one into a field in Pennsylvania.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, killed more than 2,400.

42: Biden Admin Repeats Fake News Russia Bounty Story to Justify Sanctions

The White House used a recently discredited narrative to justify enacting sanctions against Russia.

New reports state that U.S. intelligence had “low to moderate” confidence in a story claiming that Russia offered members of the Taliban bounties in exchange for killing American soldiers, but the Biden administration cited the narrative as one of the reasons Russia should be punished. Not only was the Russia bounty story mentioned in the White House “fact sheet” detailing the sanctions but it was also echoed by government officials.

Despite former President Donald Trump’s insistence in 2020 that the story was “fake news,” corporate media immediately latched onto the narrative and promoted it as fact. Many of the same news organizations that peddled the story have yet to walk back their previous coverage.

41: Biden Makes Misleading Statements About Gun Delay for 2015 Charleston Shooter

During his announcement of new gun control executive orders, Biden claimed that it was a three-day FBI background check delay called the “Charleston loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to execute the 2015 Charleston church shooting.

“What happened is someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service,” Biden said. “If the FBI didn’t complete the background check within three days. There was a process. If it wasn’t done in three days, according to the Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun.”

As the Washington Free Beacon notes, not only did Roof shoot up the church more than two months after his background check was delayed, but “the FBI did not find the records that should have prohibited him from buying a gun” due to a mistake by the agency.

40: Biden Insists Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden insisted during his gun control executive order announcement that gun manufacturers can’t be sued.

“People don’t realize the only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry, that can’t be sued, that are exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers,” Biden said. “This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued.”

As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, multiple gun manufacturers such as Remington and Sig Sauer have been sued over design flaws and defects in their products. The Free Beacon also noted that while the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act protects manufacturers from lawsuits “stemming from the criminal misuse of guns by third parties,” other industries including pharmaceutical companies tasked with creating the COVID-19 vaccine are protected have immunity under the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.

39: Biden Says Gun Show Purchases Don’t Require Background Checks

During his announcement introducing multiple gun control executive orders, Biden said background checks are not required for purchases at gun shows.

“Most people don’t know when you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check but you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want with no background check,” Biden claimed.

BIDEN: ""You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want–no background check."" pic.twitter.com/TbvfDPEwlp — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 8, 2021

While private firearm sellers in some states may complete gun show transactions without a background check, what many Democrats often label as the “gun show loophole,” any gun dealers with a federal firearms license are required to run background checks on customers investing in a weapon.

When confronted with a fact-check on Biden’s comments, the White House denied the president’s words just minutes after he stated them.

“No, it’s not his belief,” Psaki said. “He believes that gun that background check should be universal. … We know what his position is.”

A reporter just asked Jen Psaki why Biden lied and said, ""You go to a gun show, you can buy what you want and no background check."" Psaki just said the complete OPPOSITE and said ""it is not his belief."" These two comments were made within 60 mins of each other.

38: Biden Repeats Spurious Claims About Georgia’s New Election Law

Biden told ESPN that Georgia’s new election reform law not only bans water and food in polling lines but also closes polls early so working people can’t vote.

“This is Jim Crow on steroids, but they’re doing it in Georgia and 40 other states,” Biden said. “Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Come on. Are you going to close a polling place at 5:00, where can people just get off? This is all about people, working folks, ordinary folks that I grew up with, from being able to vote.”

Despite Biden’s claims, nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged. The new law also provides exceptions for “poll officers” to give voters food and water as long as they are not provided by political interest groups.

37: Biden Insists ‘No One Making Under $400k Will See Their Federal Taxes Go Up’

During his introduction of a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, Biden repeated the lie that “no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period.”

“This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well,” Biden said. “Right now a middle-class couple, a firefighter and a teacher with two kids, making a combined salary of say $110,000 to $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad, jobs overseas … is bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, wrong for our future.”

Despite months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage, White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

36: Biden Repeats Falsehoods About Trump’s Tax Cut

Less than one week after he stated the claim during his first press conference, Biden insisted that “83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent” because of Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden says again that in Trump tax cuts, ""83% of the money went to the top 1%."" That's a think tank projection of what would happen in 2027 if its individual cuts expired after 2025 as scheduled, not what has happened already; estimate is top 1% got 21% in 2018, get 25% in 2025. — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) March 31, 2021

As previously noted by The Federalist and other outlets, Trump’s tax plan not only benefitted Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Biden, fact-checkers determined as early as 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

35: Biden Says Georgia’s Election Law Cuts Back Voting Hours for Working Americans

Biden is spreading misinformation that Georgia’s new election law ends voting hours early, making it difficult for working Americans to get to the polls after they leave their jobs for the day.

“What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick … deciding that you’re going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work,” the president said during his first press conference.

Biden repeated the falsehood in an official statement released just one day after his presser, claiming that “among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.

While Biden insists the new law is “un-American” and “sick,” nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged.

34: Biden Insists He Is Tough on China

During his first presser, Biden claimed he will “deal with China effectively” by “investing in American workers and American science” and “hold China accountable.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, says, “China’s corporate income tax rate is 25 percent, despite being a Communist nation” and that Biden’s promise to “increase our federal rate to 28 percent, on top of state corporate taxes, exposes American firms to takeovers from competitors based in Communist China.”

The committee also noted that Biden “has so far not committed to any action to enforce the China Phase One Agreement achieved during the Trump Administration, which included very specific requirements that protect American workers.”

33: Biden Makes Misleading Claim About R&D Investments

In his first official press event nine weeks into office, Biden claimed that research and development investments have consistently fallen since the 1960s.

“Back in the 1960s, America invested more than 2 percent of GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it is 0.7 percent,” Biden stated.

Research and development spending, however, is at its highest point and accounted for more than 3 percent of the real GDP before the COVID-19 economic shutdown.

32: Biden Falsely States Top Corporations Don’t ‘Pay a Cent in Taxes’

During his first press conference, Biden said top corporations in the United States don’t put any money toward taxes.

“Ninety of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars are not paying a cent in taxes,” Biden said, “reducing taxes to a point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, school teacher, and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, said that the claims Biden made relied on information that “continually confused the difference between taxable income and financial statements.”

“From sales taxes to property taxes to payroll taxes, Fortune 500 companies pay billions of dollars in taxes to local, state, and federal government,” they wrote in a fact check. “Federal tax laws provide important bipartisan tax incentives to encourage specific economic activity — including investments in R&D, energy innovation, low-income housing, and distressed communities — which reduces taxable income without changing financial statement profits.”

31: Biden Says Trump’s Tax Cuts Only Helped the Rich

During his press first official press event, Biden falsely claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not put “money in ordinary people’s pockets” and instead only helped the “top 1 percent.”

“Do you hear them complain when they passed [a] close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, with 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Do you hear them talk about that at all?” Biden asked.

Not only did Trump’s tax cut benefit Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, a fact even corporate media outlets noted, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Democrats, fact-checkers determined in 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

30: Biden Says Majority of Migrant Families that Cross Border Are Sent Back

Biden said in his first press conference 64 days after inauguration that a majority of the migrant families crossing the border illegally are sent back.

“If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back,” Biden said at the White House. “We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming.”

According to Customs and Border Protection data, however, a fraction of the 20,000 family units apprehended have been sent back.

Further, Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for the Wall Street Journal, reported on March 23 that an internal document she reviewed with her colleagues found that the weekend prior to Biden’s press conference, “only about 10 percent of families were being expelled.”

29: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Address Communist China’s Human Rights Abuses

During his first official press conference, Biden implied that his predecessor former President Donald Trump did not address communist China’s human rights abuses.

“I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happened to the Uyghurs, what’s happened in Hong Kong, what’s happening in the country. That’s who we are,” Biden said. “The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world.”

The Trump administration, however, did directly condemn China’s actions against the minority Muslim population located in the Xinjiang province as a genocide before leaving office. Following investigations into the CCP’s use of mass imprisonment of more than 1 million people, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, and limits on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the United States has definitively evaluated and labeled these actions by the CCP as “crimes against humanity.”

Secondly, the Biden regime just deleted the State Dept page highlighting China’s human rights abuses: https://t.co/Py9yNKPFsD — R.J. Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 25, 2021

The Trump administration previously issued sanctions against China shortly after Trump signed the “Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020” into law in June of 2020.

28: Biden Says Migrants Not Flooding the Border Because of Him

During his first press conference, Biden claimed illegal aliens are not crossing the southern U.S. border because of his rhetoric and open border policies, but because migrants’ chances of “dying on the way because of the heat in the desert” are lower in January, February, and March and because of the instability in their home countries.

“I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m a nice guy. … The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. … That’s not the reason they’re coming. The reason they are coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in [their] country.”

Biden believes surge in migrants is due to conditions in their countries & weather that's better for traveling not because he's seen as a ""nice guy"" who's lax on the border

""Does anyone suggest there was a 31% increase under Trump bc he was a nice guy?""https://t.co/eOGI4nbPU4 pic.twitter.com/d7ZAj2sgSI — KPIX 5 (@KPIXtv) March 25, 2021

While Biden might be convinced people are flooding to the U.S.-Mexico border in a normal immigration cycle, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador recently said it is the new president’s migration policies and rhetoric that sparked hopeful “expectations” and created the border crisis.

“Expectations were created that with the government of President Biden, there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border, thinking that it is easier to do so,” López Obrador said, just weeks after he told reporters that many of those crossing the border illegally view Biden as “the migrant president.”

Some illegal aliens who crossed the border have also testified that Biden was the deciding factor for why they chose to come to the U.S.

“So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?” ABC’s Martha Raddatz pressed.

“Basically. Basically,” one migrant father replied. “The main thing was the violence in our country. And the second thing, I think, was Joe Biden.”

27: Biden White House Claims Regular Talks With McConnell

White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed at a March 24 briefing that the president regularly speaks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

McConnell’s office, however, told NBC News reporter Julie Tsirkin that the two have only spoken once since the inauguration in January, which focused on the military coup in Myanmar.

26: Biden Lowers Tax Hike Threshold After Promising It Would Only Affect People Making Over $400K

While the president recently told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that his bid to increase taxes would only apply to “anybody making more than $400,000,” and that any individual making less than that amount “won’t see one single penny in additional federal tax,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

Biden tax hike could hit people earning $200K, White House clarifies https://t.co/YYzEqoDPJz pic.twitter.com/wW4Wj6aCPt — New York Post (@nypost) March 17, 2021

This revelation comes after months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage that their attempts to raise taxes would not affect individuals making under $400,000 a year but eventually morphed into households making under $400,000 a year. Studies from at least five economic analysis institutions suggest, “Biden’s proposals would increase taxes, on average, for households at every income level” and that his intention to repeal Trump’s tax cuts would only further this outcome.

25: Biden Makes Sweeping Projection About Child Poverty

During his March 11 address, Biden said the COVID-19 spending bill “will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts.”

While researchers at certain think tanks and universities conceded that portions of the American Rescue Plan have the potential to “reduce child poverty by more than half in 2021,” the provisions in the bill apply only to this year, leaving the long-term effects of the spending bill on child poverty a mystery. There is no current evidence to suggest that the policies included in the plan will have a long-lasting effect on child poverty.

24: Biden Overreports Number of Vaccinated American 65 and Older

In his address on March 11, Biden lied about when the COVID-19 vaccine first became available in the United States. He also misspoke about the number of Americans 65 and older who have received the vaccine.

“When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans — after months — only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination,” Biden said. “Today that number is 65 percent.”

The vaccine, however, was not available for months before Biden took office. The first COVID-19 vaccine dose in the United States was administered on Dec. 14, just one month before the new president transitioned into the White House. Not only was Biden wrong about when the shots first became available, but he also lied that 65 percent of Americans 65 years old and above have been vaccinated. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that only 62.4 percent of those 65 and older received at least one round of the vaccine, not 65 percent.

23: Biden Claims US COVID Death Toll Exceeds Three Wars and 9/11

During his address to the nation on March 11, Biden falsely claimed that the total number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. was more than those in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11.

“I carry a card in my pocket with a number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It’s on the back of my schedule.

As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That’s more deaths than World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined,” Biden stated.

President Biden notes the more than 527,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States: ""That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11, combined."" https://t.co/Zv4cfRYdhW pic.twitter.com/NKcXVzZcyy — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 12, 2021

While Biden is correct in saying that at least 527,726 Americans have reportedly died from coronavirus, the nation’s death toll does not exceed the fatalities that resulted from the three wars and one terrorist attack he mentioned in his speech. Even without 9/11 included, more than 580,000 people died fighting in the aforementioned wars. “World War I: 116,516 deaths, World War II: 405,399, Vietnam: 58,220” the Washington Post reported.

22: Biden Claims Coronavirus Was Met with Silence

In his prime time address to the nation on March 11, Biden claimed the novel Wuhan coronavirus “was met with silence and spread unchecked.”

The Trump administration, however, convened a White House coronavirus task force, which CNN complained was too white, while congressional Democrats were pursuing partisan impeachment proceedings.

21: Biden Says Goal of 100 Million Vaccine Shots in 100 Days Was Tough for Him to Meet

Biden claimed his administration’s initial goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days was difficult to meet in his prime time address on March 11.

“When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top,” Biden said. “I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people’s arms with my first 100 days in office.”

That vaccination pace, however, had already been met by his White House predecessor. About 1.3 million Americans were vaccinated on Biden’s first full day in office.

20: Biden Says COVID Spending Bill Garnered Bipartisan Support

Shortly after Democrats in the Senate passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending bill, Biden falsely claimed in a celebratory speech that the legislation garnered bipartisan support.

“Quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Elected officials heard overwhelming public support. Every public opinion poll showed overwhelming support for this plan,” Biden said.

Just watched his whole 10-minute monologue and this did happen. Also tries to describe bill as bi-partisan even though not a single Republican in either chamber voted for it https://t.co/P6HFBIePqD — Julie Kelly 🇺🇸 (@julie_kelly2) March 6, 2021

Despite Biden’s rhetoric pretending that the legislation received support from people on both sides of the political aisle, every Republican senator voted against passing the massive bill. Last month, the White House agreed to meet with 10 Republicans to discuss a smaller relief proposal that cut spending by almost two-thirds. Biden, who launched his presidency on a platform of unifying the country and toning down partisanship, however, did not budge on his decision to push the legislation through both chambers of Congress without GOP support.

19: Biden and White House Deny Border Crisis as Crossings Surge

Biden denied that there is a crisis at the border after departing a White House briefing in early March evaluating how to provide more than 20,000 beds for the largest projected influx of unaccompanied migrant children who are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

“We’ll be able to handle it,” Biden told reporters as he was escorted out of the room by his vice president.

When asked if there’s a border crisis, Biden says “no”https://t.co/1r8KjY5OKR pic.twitter.com/itA90NEAyo — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 2, 2021

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also told reporters at the beginning of March that there is no crisis at the southern border, despite his own agency’s projections that more than 117,000 unaccompanied minors will attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border this year, numbers that are on track to exceed the current record of minors in federal custody by 45 percent. More than 13,000 of them are expected to come to the United States in May, giving the Biden administration just two months to sort out its plans for housing migrant minors after refusing to expel them.

“Do you believe that right now there is a crisis at the border?” a reporter asked.

“No,” Mayorkas said. “There is a challenge at the border that we are managing. … The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are working around the clock seven days a week to ensure that we do not have a crisis at the border, that we manage the challenge, as acute as the challenge is.”

18: Biden Says Administration Not Opening New Migrant Centers

Biden falsely claimed during a February interview with Univision that the new administration is merely reopening migrant camps operational during the Trump administration even as the Biden White House creates new ones.

“They opened up one, one that was a former one used in the administration in the last administration,” Biden said. “Our hope and expectation is that won’t stay open very long and that we’ll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely.”

https://twitter.com/BonillaJL/status/1365450210227458051?s=20

Border agents opened up a new facility in Donna, Texas, three weeks ago, according to the Washington Post, while creating new camps in Del Rio, Texas, and Arizona.

17: Biden Repeats False Claim That Trump Told Public to Inject Bleach

Biden repeated the debunked story, rated false even by left-leaning PolitiFact, that President Donald Trump recommended during a White House coronavirus press briefing to inject bleach.

“I think there’s a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn’t do it for you,” Biden said in remarks to black essential workers.

Trump, however, said no such thing, as Biden also asserted last summer. Instead, Trump was speaking on the role of disinfectants help in preventing serious infection with viruses such as the novel Wuhan coronavirus.

Speaking w/ Black essential workers, Biden says, ""I can't tell you how much a difference you're making. We have met with people all over the country…I think there's a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn't do it for you.""

16: Biden Lies Again About Not Inheriting a Vaccine Plan

During his visit to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing plant in mid-February, Biden once again falsely claimed that his administration did not inherit a vaccine plan from former President Donald Trump.

“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,” Biden said. “My predecessors — as my mother would say, God love ’em — failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.”

Despite this repeated claim from Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, officials such as Anthony Fauci have reassured the public that the Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed did not leave the Biden administration empty-handed.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci said, disputing the White House’s claims.

Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s project to facilitate the creation and distribution of the vaccine, also passed along a plan to Biden and his team once they assumed office.

15: Biden Says There Is ‘Overwhelming Consensus’ to Pass Excessive COVID Spending

During a February CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper, Biden claimed there was “overwhelming consensus” to pass a coronavirus spending bill with excessive funding.

I’m committed to pass — look, here’s — some of you are probably economists or college professors or you’re teachers in school. This is the first time in my career — and as you can tell, I’m over 30 — the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over — and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much.

A column in the Wall Street Journal published in January disproves Biden’s erroneous assertion by highlighting remarks from several of Biden’s own political allies on the left who refute the idea of passing a gargantuan package.

Another article in the New Yorker published days before Biden’s CNN appearance cited warnings over Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package by prominent economists.

“The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive,” Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, tweeted.

14: Biden Denies Psaki Said Schools Should Open Just One Day a Week

The same night he claimed a COVID-19 vaccine was not created until after he joined the White House, Biden denied that White House press secretary Jen Psaki ever said schools should be open just one day a week, claiming it was simply “not true” and eventually clarifying his statement to say it was “mistaken in communication.”

Asked about @PressSec saying that schools should be open one day a week, Biden says ""that's not true"" and it was a ""mistaken in communication."" The quote from Psaki: pic.twitter.com/TVbeo80JnB — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) February 17, 2021

At the beginning of February, Psaki proudly declared that Biden’s goal to have children back to classroom learning by his 100th day in office, in April, only applied to half the country’s schools and only requires one day of in-person learning — meaning just 50 percent of kids attending school for about five days total would accomplish the “goal.” When a reporter asked her to clarify the Biden administration’s position, Psaki doubled down on the plan to require just one day of in-person learning per week in “the majority of schools.” Days later, the White House flip-flopped its position on school reopenings, and Psaki told reporters that Biden’s plan was to ensure every school would be open “five days a week.”

13: Biden Claims COVID Vaccine Wasn’t Around When He Assumed Office

During a CNN town hall on Feb. 16, Biden falsely claimed the United States did not have a COVID-19 vaccine when he transitioned into the White House in late January.

President Biden said in reference to a vaccine — ""Which we didn't have when I came into office."" That's just blatantly false. @CnnTown — Beverly Hallberg (@BeverlyHallberg) February 17, 2021

Against faulty predictions from journalists, so-called experts, and verified Twitter users who cast doubt on former-President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, the first round of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States to health care workers in mid-December following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use and mass distribution approval. The FDA also applied emergency authorization to the Moderna vaccine in mid-December, approving it for widespread distribution and use long before Biden joined the White House.

Biden received both doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine before he was inaugurated.

12: Biden Statement on Impeachment Falsely Attributes Officer’s Death to Capitol Riot

Biden’s statement on Trump’s impeachment acquittal opened with the assertion that a Capitol police officer who died on the day of the January riots was killed by the mob of Trump supporters storming the congressional complex.

“It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on January 6, 2021,” Biden said.

There is absolutely no evidence to prove, however, that Sicknick was brutally killed by the mob that day, a claim amplified by Democrats throughout the impeachment proceedings with the help of legacy outlets such as the New York Times, which quietly later issued a correction as the trial came to a close.

Amazing: the NYT just quietly appended this so-called ""update"" – which is really a correction if not a retraction – to its Jan 8 article about Officer Sicknick's death.

11: Kamala Harris Repeats Bogus Claim New White House Starting ‘From Scratch’ on Vaccines

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the bogus claim that the Biden White House has been forced to start “from scratch” to handle the coronavirus vaccine rollout.

“We’re starting from scratch,” Harris said, “on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year.”

Even National Institutes of Health Director Anthony Fauci rejected the assertion made by White House officials in January, as the Trump administration reached the 1 million shots-a-day threshold Biden has attempted to claim credit for.

10: Biden Said He Would Fire Staff ‘On the Spot’ for ‘Disrepect.’ Hasn’t Fired Deputy Press Secretary

Biden issued a stark warning to about 1,000 presidential appointees upon taking the reins of the Oval Office.

“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect or talk down to someone, I promise you, I will fire you on the spot — on the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts,” Biden said.

On Feb. 12, however, Vanity Fair reported White House deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo threatened a Politico reporter inquiring about a romantic relationship with an Axios political reporter tasked with covering the vice president after leaving the Biden beat.

“I will destroy you,” Ducklo reportedly threatened Politico’s Tara Palmeri, if the paper published the story.

Instead of unemployment, however, Ducklo was given a one-week suspension without pay.

9: Biden Said He ‘Misspoke’ When Claiming US Would Reach Only 100 Million Vaccines in 100 Days

Biden said during a Jan. 25 press conference he “misspoke” when claiming the United States would reach only 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots given out within the administration’s first 100 days, a pace reached by the Trump administration. Biden then emphasized a hope of reaching 150 million instead.

The White House COVID-19 Response Team tweeted two days later, however, that the Biden administration’s goal of 100 million doses in 100 days hasn’t changed.

The President set an ambitious goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days. To get there, we’ve got to average about a million shots per day.

8: Biden Trashed Trump’s China Travel Ban as Xenophobic Before Signing His Own

When Trump implemented a travel ban on China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, then-candidate Biden railed against the executive action as “xenophobic,” claiming such restrictions do not work.

Less than a year later, Biden has implemented his own travel bans on South Africa, Brazil, Great Britain, and 26 other European countries in the second week of his presidency.

7: Biden Team: Trump Vaccination Plan ‘Worse Than We Could Have Imagined’

After Biden staffers lied, telling CNN there was “nothing for us to rework” in terms of a vaccination distribution plan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki admitted at the podium during a Jan. 25 briefing that there was a plan — they just won’t give credit. Psaki told reporters the plan from the Trump White House was “much worse than we could have imagined.”

Below is the chart outline for the distribution process under Operation Warp Speed, which produced not one, but two coronavirus vaccines in record time.

6: Biden Warns Pandemic Will Worsen After Pledging to Shut Down Virus

Biden spent the entire campaign last year running on a platform to shut down the novel coronavirus, only to back away from the signature pledge on day three of his White House tenure with a bold admission.

“There’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,” Biden said on Jan. 22.

Not only did Biden’s official campaign promise acknowledge that “the trajectory of COVID-19 in America is headed in the wrong direction” and that his administration would be the solution, but Biden also pledged numerous times to “immediately put in place a national strategy that will position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives.”

5: Biden Claims Federal Government Never Acted with Urgency to Combat Pandemic

Joe Biden claimed the federal government failed to “act with the urgency” that was necessary to combat the coronavirus pandemic, apparently neglecting to mention the Trump White House’s Operation Warp Speed that produced two viable coronavirus vaccines by the year’s end.

Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn also pointed out that Congress passed trillions in stimulus, providing funds for pandemic efforts and economic recovery.

4: Biden Team Tells CNN Trump Offered No Plan for Vaccine Distribution

Sources within the Biden administration told CNN they inherited no vaccine distribution plan from the previous White House.

“There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,” one source reportedly told CNN’s MJ Lee, except there was, as outlined in Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, included below.

The Biden team’s statements were also contradicted by Dr. Fauci the same afternoon.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci told reporters.

3: Biden White House Claims Elites ‘Celebrating’ Is Exception to Mask Edict

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki justified Biden’s decision with his family to forgo face masks at the Lincoln Memorial after signing an executive order requiring them on all federal lands.

“He was celebrating a historic day in our country. … We have bigger things to worry about,” said Psaki, whose dismissal of the face mask as an insignificant issue was contradicted by the White House edict passed hours earlier.

Though Biden has received both shots of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines stipulate that vaccinated people are to continue wearing face masks, citing a lack of research showing whether those vaccinated can still spread the virus. While Biden likely did not need to wear a face mask, considering he was outside and adequately distanced from others, the absence of a mask flies in the face of Biden’s executive order, in which “celebrating” is not listed as an exception.

2: Biden Falsely Claims ‘All’ Media Smeared Vaccine Plan as ‘Impossible’

Joe Biden defended his administration’s goal to vaccinate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office after a reporter questioned whether the target was too modest.

“When I announced it, you all said it wasn’t possible. C’mon. Gimme a break, man,” Biden snapped.

1: Biden Vows to Be Unity President After Smearing GOP Sens. as Nazis

Biden launched his first term as commander-in-chief by branding himself as the unifier-in-chief while aggressively pursuing a partisan progressive agenda promoting left-wing ideas of “social justice” after smearing two Republican senators as Nazi collaborators.

“To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart,” Biden pleaded with the American people.

Defunding The Police Will Mean More More Pain For The Poor,"In Philadelphia in January, 25-year old Milan Loncar — a recent Temple University graduate and husband to be — was walking his dog when he was brutally gunned down in the streets of Philadelphia, the victim of an armed robbery that he did not resist. He died while still holding the leash of his rescue dog.

The gunman had a violent criminal history and should have been in jail the night of Loncar’s murder, but he had been released on reduced bail just two weeks prior. Due to the crack work of Philadelphia’s Finest, the 20-year old habitual criminal was apprehended within hours of the crime. But what if the police were no longer on the job?

We should anticipate more senseless crimes like this in the days ahead fueled by radical public policies that call for defunding law enforcement and eliminating cash bail. The proponents of these policies envision a utopian state in which criminals repent, victims forgive, and we all merrily sit around the community campfire singing “Kumbaya.” The reality is likely to be far different.

The left has gained the power of the White House as well as of Congress. Their new Wild West is upon us. Buckle up, it’s going to be a rough ride.

Economic Concerns

Defunding and otherwise reducing law enforcement is likely to have profound, reactive effects across society.

Homeowners are unlikely to be passive in protecting themselves, their families, and their property. They can be expected to expeditiously fill the vacuum. This means an increased number of armed individuals with limited training in gun safety.

Not only is this likely to result in more accidental fatalities, but such individuals are likely to be less judicious than law enforcement in the use of lethal force. Hence, it is unrealistic to believe that defunding law enforcement will lead to a decrease in the number of avoidable fatalities.

Defunding law enforcement should be expected to increase the number of individuals engaged in criminal behavior because this reduces the cost of such behavior. Criminals can reasonably expect a lower likelihood of being apprehended and successfully prosecuted for their crimes. Eliminating cash bail only exacerbates this problem. The result is a perfect storm of more crime, fewer police officers, and an increased number of poorly trained gun owners, all of which can be expected to increase the number of avoidable deaths.

To the extent that there are economies of scale in provisioning law enforcement (the average cost of law enforcement decreases with the quantity of law enforcement supplied), defunding the police is likely to raise the overall cost of supplying a given level of community protection. This higher cost is likely to translate into fewer resources dedicated to providing community protection.

Defunding law enforcement will result not only in a decrease in the number of police officers on the job but a decrease in their wages and salaries. Factors tend to flow to their highest rates of return. The more proficient law enforcement personnel will be attracted to the higher wages and better working conditions prompted by the increased demand for private security.

Less proficient law-enforcement personnel will have fewer outside opportunities and therefore will remain on the job. The result is fewer Joe Fridays and more Barney Fifes. Hence, defunding law enforcement is likely to lead not only to a decrease in the overall number of police officers but a decrease in the average proficiency of police officers. This will cause more avoidable deaths that will trigger an increase in taxes to pay for costly litigation, financial settlements, and higher rates for liability insurance.

Defunding law enforcement is precisely the opposite of what the nation needs. Compensation for law enforcement should increase to offset the increased risk and decreased job satisfaction. Police officers are also subject to a higher likelihood of criminal charges as a result of community sentiment turning against them and a new wave of leftist prosecutors that impose more exacting standards for the use of lethal force.

In facing a violent criminal, police officers face something of a “Hobson’s choice.” If they act too slowly, they risk their own life, and if they act too quickly they risk the unjustified death of the suspect. The litigation, both civil and criminal, that follows in this latter case limits their career opportunities in the best state of the world and their freedom in the worst. All of this for a median annual salary of less than $58,000.

The record number of law enforcement retirements over the past year is a testament to this new reality. In New York City, retirements are up 75 percent, disproportionately among the most experienced officers and detectives. This does not take into account an alarming 200 percent increase in law enforcement personnel that have filed for retirement and are awaiting pension board decisions.

Concerns have also been raised that there are too many “bad apples” in law enforcement. Even if this were true, you don’t secure higher-quality apples by paying less for them. If you want more proficient law enforcement, pay them more, not less. Tasked with the impossible, law enforcement deserves our respect, not our derision.

Public Policy Concerns

It is difficult to envision how a public policy of defunding law enforcement could pass an objective cost-benefit test given the multitude of adverse effects that it is likely to engender. Any policy change should be evaluated based on economic efficiency and social equity. The policy of defunding law enforcement fails on both metrics

The adverse economic effects associated with defunding law enforcement are only exacerbated by their disparate, community-wide impacts. Higher-income households can be expected to take prompt action to mitigate the increased risk to their families and property that results from defunding law enforcement. This may take the form of increased use of private security, either at the individual household or neighborhood level.

Lower-income households will not be as fortunate. They will have little choice but to fend for themselves or bear the brunt of the unavoidable increase in crime.

Insurance rates can be expected to rise in lockstep with the risk of theft and property damage, assuming that insurance is even available given the high risk of loss. It should therefore not be surprising that the lower-income communities are where we will see the largest percentage decrease in property values and the highest percentage increase in insurance rates.

Defunding law enforcement is a highly regressive public policy precisely because of its grossly disparate, adverse impacts. The highest costs will be borne by the most economically disadvantaged communities.

The number of avoidable deaths is likely to increase due to fewer and less-proficient police officers on the job and an increased number of firearms in untrained hands. This is why policymakers must consider both the first-order and the second-order effects of defunding law enforcement.

I do not question that in select cases social workers and mental health professionals may be able to diffuse the severity of a situation that the presence of law enforcement might only aggravate. These benefits, which have yet to be rigorously quantified, must be balanced against the greater risk of placing these social workers and mental health professionals directly in harm’s way with law enforcement responsible for their safety.

To Do No Harm

Every just society has a solemn responsibility to continuously and objectively reevaluate when lethal force by law enforcement is warranted. Any disparities in the use of such force that cannot be explained by differences in crime rates across minority and non-minority subgroups should be rigorously scrutinized and corrective action taken.

Nonetheless, defunding law enforcement is a radical and myopic policy that fails any objective cost-benefit test and is found wanting on social-equity grounds.

Defunding law enforcement will not only cost more lives, increase crime, and lower the overall standard of living, but it will also disproportionately harm our poorest communities that lack the resources to insulate themselves from its harmful and likely tragic consequences. The guiding principle for policymakers is no different than that for physicians under the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/28/defunding-the-police-will-mean-more-shootings-higher-taxes-and-more-pain-for-the-poor/,2021-01-28
Biden Is Hiring By Race And Sex. Here’s How That Failed In Seattle,"President Joe Biden is incredibly proud of his staff’s sexual and racial diversity. You don’t even have to ask. He’ll tell you that his choices were tailor-made to “look like the country,” meeting he demands of his party’s identity-focused base. Yet, as we’ve seen time and time again, staffing based on immutable characteristics instead of earned qualifications can only end poorly.

Party activists oftentimes stubbornly adhere to a radical worldview, a position much easier to hold when not implementing plans. They expect whomever they support to be just as rigid.

But when any appointee takes on a job for an administration, he or she meets the undeniable reality that ideological obedience isn’t always practical. That’s especially true when trying to please more than just the party base ahead of a crucial midterm election. Equally true? Many mainstream politicians aren’t nearly as woke as their virtue-signaling buzzwords suggest.

The moment a bureaucrat veers away from the positions he or she is “supposed” to hold, activists quickly forget the excitement of a diversity hire. In all their rage at administration officials not pursuing exactly what they demand, activists seldom realize that maybe they shouldn’t have judged the book by its cover.

You needn’t look outside of Seattle to see the chaos and disappointment that comes from blindly embracing tribalism. Activists once celebrated many Seattle “firsts” as they earned leadership posts. Years later, the same activists ran those “firsts” out of town for not being leftist enough. Indeed, if there’s a lesson here, it’s that Seattle’s trouble could soon become Biden’s.

Today’s Leftists Always Want More

Seattle’s first black, female police chief Carmen Best somehow shocked the activist community for being too supportive of law enforcement. Mitzi Johanknecht, King County’s first lesbian sheriff, wouldn’t blindly back radical police reforms. Activists weren’t pleased.

Seattle’s first lesbian and American Indian school Superintendent Denise Juneau didn’t super-serve non-white people the way activists demanded. And it wasn’t enough that Seattle’s first lesbian Mayor Jenny Durkan gave radicals space for an illegal (and ultimately deadly) occupation. When she didn’t give in to every whim of the increasingly radical Black Lives Matter and Antifa movements, she became their enemy.

It’s not so much that these leaders were bad at their jobs; that’s obviously subjective. It’s that they didn’t meet the expectations of a leftist movement that assumed these leaders could effectively hold positions based exclusively on their identities. They all mostly delivered what they said they would, or at least tried. But when all you see is identity, you pay little attention to anything else.

Identity politics is an innately pernicious concept promoted by America’s leftists. Meant to eradicate perceived institutional or systemic bias, it does the opposite, creating a system where one gains an unearned advantage due to membership in a marginalized community. It’s institutionalized tokenism.

The concept has evolved into the practice of electing, appointing, or hiring a variety of people that “look like the country.” In other words, whether it’s Biden’s cabinet, the local police force, or the boards of corporations, it must represent a menagerie of different demographics.

It’s no longer about one’s qualifications based on skills or ideas; instead, you’re the right choice merely because of the group you belong to. It renders us into marks on a checklist meant to satisfy the demands of groups promoting the most superficial aspects of diversity.

This is in no way, shape, or form a good way to pick leaders. Indeed, the events in Seattle over the last several months show you the limitations of this condescending ideological view.

The Demands of Radicals

As a black woman, Best was supposed to understand the strained relationships between black Americans and law enforcement. No doubt, she did. Johanknecht, as a lesbian in a field dominated by straight men, is supposed to fight for marginalized communities. She fights for everyone.

Both fell short of expectations because neither reformed their agencies to meet the demands of radicals. The anti-police movement claimed to Best that they had the right to “peacefully protest” by throwing rocks, bottles, and explosives at police officers. Johanknecht was supposed to usher in a new era of police reforms, handing overly broad investigative powers to an oversight committee that views police as the enemy.

After dealing with a recalcitrant mob enabled by a vindictive Seattle City Council, Best retired. The radical defund movement was too much for any reasonable person to handle. She told the city, “I’m done.”

The defund movement also claimed Johanknecht, albeit in a different way. The majority-Democrat King County Council quickly pushed through charter amendments that Seattle voters overwhelmingly supported last November. It took away the entire county’s ability to vote for sheriff, transferring the power to an appointment. Soon, she will be out of a job.

The same scripts played out with Durkan and Juneau. Durkan bent over backward to satisfy the ravenous demands of an increasingly out-of-control activist community, even giving them an autonomous zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Still, it wasn’t enough.

The pride of electing its first lesbian mayor wore off when she wouldn’t defund the police by 50 percent. After facing a recall election (tossed by the court before signature gathering), Durkan saw the writing on the wall. Facing a tough road to re-election, she announced she would not seek a second term.

The city’s latest victim has been Juneau. Facing scorn from area activists for not doing enough to help black students succeed and a school board sending overt messages they wouldn’t extend her contract, the city’s “historic” school leader announced she’s out at the end of her contract.

When these women came to power, Seattleites lauded their identities. They tweeted their delight in electing a lesbian mayor and posted Facebook updates to declare Seattle a progressive city with an American Indian superintendent — along with an acknowledgment that we live on stolen Duwamish land, of course.

Regression in the Name of Tolerance

Too often, leftists view all minorities monolithically. As they think all of one identity group necessarily hold the same values, ideas, experiences, and lack of privilege, so they think all such people categorized by race and sexuality will naturally pursue policies and programs that satisfy leftist ideologues. How utterly demeaning.

Activists sprinted further away from what was supposed to be a societal ideal: judging people on their character and skills, not on their race, sex, or sexuality. We’ve regressed in the name of tolerance.

Press most Seattleites on why they celebrated any of the women at the time, and they won’t tell you much about policy positions or specific values those leaders held. You’d get a lot of assumptions based on expectations and a lot of people let down. When you focus on the least interesting part about someone (his identity), at the expense of the most interesting (his beliefs and actions), you set yourself up for disappointment.

Biden promised us “the most diverse Cabinet representative of all … Asian Americans, African Americans, Latinos, LGBTQ, across the board.” Most of us would have been happy with forward-thinking, unifying thinkers, with an assumption that it would generate a diverse staff on its own. But Biden talks about his team as if he asked to see headshots over resumes. Ultimately, that’s a surefire way to upset just about everyone.

Capitol Police Use Razor Wire To Keep Preschoolers From Sledding,"This time, “cancel culture” has come for pre-schoolers. This past Sunday, the nation’s capital had its largest measurable snowfall in two years.

In prior times, children who wanted to enjoy the wintry weather would flock to the west front of the U.S. Capitol Building, whose gentle slopes make for some of the best sledding or snow tubing in greater Washington. The event has become so commonplace that four years ago the Architect of the Capitol (the real “AOC”) published guidance and tips for anyone wishing to partake in this winter tradition.

But instead of frolicking children, anyone who dared venture near Capitol Hill this weekend would have found a much more intimidating sight: Two separate layers of fencing, topped with razor wire, prohibiting entry for “unauthorized” guests:

The scene represents the virtual fortress that has erupted in Washington since the Jan. 6 Capitol riots — a sad commentary on modern American society.

District Officials Want to Open Up

Somewhat surprisingly, local leaders in the District of Columbia, most of them Democrats, finally found a lockdown they wish to end.

Because weather forecasts had predicted snow for several days, congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton released a statement requesting permission for children to sled on the Capitol grounds. She noted that beginning in 2015, she has had inserted specific language requiring the Capitol Police to open the Capitol grounds to sledding (yes, the security state tried to stop sledding at the Capitol after 9/11, and yes, Congress had to act to stop the insanity)

Norton made an eloquent case for sledding, pointing out that “children across America have endured an extremely challenging year” given both the coronavirus pandemic and seemingly perpetual shutdowns of public schools. As one might expect, however, the Capitol Police denied the request, citing the “current security posture, COVID-19 restrictions, and the deconstruction of the Inaugural platform.”

The denial came mere days after the Capitol Police’s acting chief, Yogananda Pittman, said in a statement that “vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure [of the Capitol] must be made, to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol.”

Local Neighborhood, or Police State?

As someone who has lived and worked in Washington for decades, much of that time living on Capitol Hill, Pittman’s statement, and the general security posture after the Jan. 6 riots, has a feel of déjà vu. After each terror incident, security gets ratcheted up, and rarely if ever (and only begrudgingly) to get ratcheted down.

Shortly before I arrived in Washington for college, the Oklahoma City bombings shut down Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. When I returned from grad school after 9/11, I remember on several occasions being shocked at the physical transformation of Washington after the attacks. Officials shut off several blocks of streets around the Capitol complex to vehicular traffic and put bollards designed to prevent car or truck bombs around seemingly every federal building in Washington.

Some of the security changes had a logic to them. I remember quite vividly that, early on Sept. 11, 2001 — hours before the terrorist attacks later that morning — former Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, appeared on CNN to discuss the need to construct a Capitol Visitors Center. The events of that day ultimately led to the building of such a venue, which increased security while providing a better experience to the millions of people who visit the Capitol complex every year.

‘Tear Down This Wall!’

While I didn’t like it, I understood the need for an increased security presence in Washington for the inauguration, after the horrific violence and rioting that took place on Jan. 6 and the fear of attacks afterward. But at a certain point, security efforts go too far, particularly when they become a permanent fixture.

It shouldn’t take a Reaganesque speech in front of the fencing that surrounds the Capitol to understand the poor optics of making such temporary measures permanent — to say nothing of having a permanent “army” (or the equivalent thereof) should rioting ever recur. Thankfully, local officials have stated their opposition to these changes. Hopefully, their views, along with pushback from federal lawmakers, will prevent the excesses the Capitol Police proposed.

In the short term, however, there’s a far better solution. Instead of closing the Capitol grounds to sledders to keep it open for lawmakers, why not reverse the roles. Given how lawmakers in the Capitol often act like children (and the rioters who stormed it far worse), why not close the Capitol to lawmakers so the sledders can return. And when winter changes to summer, then maybe — just maybe, if they behave — we can let Congress return.

"Rochester Police Pepper-Spray 9-Year-Old Girl, Police Body Cam Shows","The Rochester, New York Police Department released body-camera footage Sunday showing a 9-year-old girl being handcuffed and pepper-sprayed by officers who were responding to a domestic disturbance, reportedly including a potentially stolen vehicle.

Last Friday afternoon, officers received a 911 call reporting “family trouble” and upon arrival found a 9-year-old girl dressed in a black hoodie and colored leggings. The girl “indicated that she wanted to kill herself, and she wanted to kill her mom,” Deputy Police Chief Andre Anderson said at a press conference Sunday. Other reports indicate that during the call, officers were approached by the girl’s custodial parent, who said she was afraid her daughter would harm herself or others.

The 9-year-old initially tried running away, Anderson said. Video footage shows an officer chasing her and attempting to provide assistance, telling the girl to “come here” and assuring her she was “not in trouble.” The girl’s mother later arrived, kicking off an argument between mother and daughter in which the mother hurled profanities and insults at the child.

Screaming and crying, the girl repeatedly told officers, “I want my dad.” Footage shows the girl resisting law enforcement, and she appears to have been handcuffed lying down in the snow while pleading with officers to stop. Anderson said officers were trying to escort the girl to the hospital, in accordance with the state’s Mental Hygiene law, but she refused to get into the back of the police car, at one point kicking an officer.

“You’re acting like a child,” one officer said, to which the girl replied, “I am a child.”

When the girl was halfway inside the police car, refusing to get fully inside as officers commanded, a female officer said, “This is your last chance, otherwise pepper spray’s going in your eyeballs.” Law enforcement tried to get her to relax and take a deep breath, but about a minute later, a different officer said, “Just spray her at this point.” The female officer is seen shaking a can that appears to be pepper-spray and reportedly discharged the irritant into the girl’s face.

As the girl screamed, officers successfully placed her into the back seat of the car and shut the door. “Unbelievable,” an officer said after the car door was closed.

The confrontation took place in what appears to be a residential neighborhood. Video footage shows at least six police vehicles were present by the end of the incident. The girl was reportedly driven to Rochester General Hospital and has since been discharged.

Police department officials released the videos of the altercation about 48 hours after the Friday event. The child’s face has been blurred in the video, and her name has not been made public.

Anderson said he is “not making any excuses for what transpired” and that the department is “looking at a culture change.”

“I’m not going to stand here and tell you that for a 9-year-old to have to be pepper-sprayed is OK,” said the Rochester Police Chief Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan.

“I can tell you that this video, as a mother, is not anything that you want to see,” said Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren. “I have a 10-year-old daughter. So she’s a child; she’s a baby. And I can tell you that this video, as a mother, is not anything that you want to see. It’s not,” Warren said. “We have to understand compassion, empathy. When you have a child that is suffering in this way and calling out for her dad, I saw my baby’s face in her face.”

Warren said she has directed the chief of police to conduct an investigation of the incident and said she welcomes a review from the city’s Police Accountability Board.

NYT Quietly Corrects Major Conspiracy Weaponized For Impeachment,"The New York Times quietly corrected a major month-old story as the Senate impeachment trial came to a close last week. The article previously claimed a police officer was beaten to death by a fire extinguisher during the January Capitol mayhem. It now appears that is false, but the Times didn’t correct its article until the impeachment trial was nearly over.

The article, headlined “Capitol Police Officer Dies From Injuries in Pro-Trump Rampage,” now prominently features an “update” at the top of the page.

“New information has emerged regarding the death of the Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick that questions the initial cause of his death provided by officials close to the Capitol police,” the note reads, without a concession or apology from the Times for perpetuating a conspiracy about Sicknick’s death that Democrats weaponized to pursue a second impeachment of Donald Trump.

Capitol Police announced the 42-year-old police officer had passed away on the evening of Jan. 7, one day after a horde of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex to protest congressional certification of President Joe Biden’s victory. Subsequent investigation by medical examiners, however, revealed little indication Sicknick had truly died after being “struck by a fire extinguisher,” as previously reported.

On Feb. 2, CNN reported investigators said it’s unclear why Sicknick collapsed the night of the riots, and failed to find signs the officer “sustained any blunt force trauma,” let alone by a fire extinguisher. A more likely theory being considered by examiners, according to CNN, was that Sicknick suffered a delayed reaction turned fatal to a chemical irritant such as pepper spray or bear spray used by the crowd.

“But investigators reviewing video of the officer’s time around the Capitol haven’t been able to confirm that in tape that has been recovered so far,” the outlet added.

On Jan. 8, ProPublica reported Sicknick’s brother, Ken, said Brian texted the family hours after the attack, relaying he had been pepper-sprayed but was doing fine.

“He texted me last night and said, ‘I got pepper-sprayed twice,’ and he was in good shape,” Ken told the outlet. “Apparently he collapsed in the Capitol and they resuscitated him using CPR.”

Although ample such evidence publicly available by Feb. 2 discredited the Times’ fire extinguisher theory, this didn’t stop Democrats from seizing on the gruesome conspiracy to amplify their narrative. The Times did not issue an update to its incorrect article until the impeachment trial began to wrap up. The impeachment concluded Feb. 13, more than a week after public information showed the Sicknick narrative Democrats used in their case was materially untrue.

In fact, it still remains unclear how exactly officer Sicknick died. According to ProPublica, “the family got word that Brian Sicknick had a blood clot and had had a stroke” the day after the riot. “A ventilator was keeping him alive.”

“Many details regarding Wednesday’s events and the direct causes of Brian’s injuries remain unknown, and our family asks the public and the press to respect our wishes in not making Brian’s passing a political issue,” Ken told Fox News two days after the riot.

Those wishes went unheard by Democrats.

“Officer Sicknick is a martyr for democracy,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Feb. 4, following Sicknick lying in honor at the Capitol Rotunda.

Democrats cited the initial Times report in their pretrial memo that apparently falsely claimed “insurrectionists killed a Capitol police officer by striking him in the head with a fire extinguisher.”

President Joe Biden repeated the unverified claim Sicknick was killed by Capitol rioters in the first line of his statement about his predecessor’s second acquittal.

“It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on January 6, 2021,” Biden said.

Biden AG Office Pick Vanita Gupta Wants To Ban Police From All Schools,"President Joe Biden’s Associate attorney general nominee, Vanita Gupta, is the CEO and president of an interest group that published a 416-page report in March 2019 calling for a “new era of public safety.” The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights report recommends “community policing,” as well as banning law enforcement from all schools. It says:

A community policing model may require changes in departments’ staffing levels, deployment patterns, and the like, which can require cutting costs, raising additional funds, and/or using resources more efficiently. Studies suggest that insufficient resources and/or inefficient resource allocation block effective implementation of community policing initiatives. Fortunately, departments don’t necessarily need additional funds to implement community policing initiatives; they may be able to secure adequate funding by reallocating or reinvesting existing resources. As such, government bodies that oversee police departments and department leadership should ensure that departments are using resources efficiently to promote community policing and that they are allocated equitably across neighborhoods served by departments.

The report’s explicit call to “end the use of police in schools as a solution to student discipline” would only put students in danger in the case of an armed shooter situation. It uses the premise that “…students of color, students with disabilities, and students who identify as LGBTQ — have increasingly been subject to arrest and excessive force for minor misbehavior or behavior that arises from a disability,” in order to conclude that “school districts should limit school requests for police assistance.”

“Police officers should have no role in student disciplinary matters,” it states. The report also calls for banning officers from being able to ask citizens “about their sexual orientation or immigration status,” blurring our clearly defined immigration laws that leftists so disdain.

“Community policing” is erroneously portrayed as a beneficial and good practice based on historical scenarios. The report references the civil rights movement and argues that activists’ use of force seemingly was the proper way to solve America’s issues. It mocks the notion of a legitimate police force, by saying there is no such idea as “real” law enforcement.

“Even leaders who express a commitment to community policing sometimes view it as separate and distinct from ‘real’ law enforcement,” the report says. “Some delegate the task of cultivating community relationships to a handful of officers and assign others to patrolling streets and responding to calls.” While the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights perpetually employs the term “community policing,” it appears to be a flimsy replacement term for the phrase “defund the police” that the left recognizes does not resonate all too well with Americans.

In June, Gupta’s leftist organization backed the “George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,” introduced by Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif. The legislation, also supported by Al Sharpton, was a knockoff of Sen. Tim Scott’s, R-S.C., JUSTICE Act that would have provided de-escalation and intervention-based training for law enforcement and placed body cameras on officers.

The “Justice in Policing Act” proposed by Democrats instead aims at “reducing implicit bias” and “limiting the continued militarization of local police departments,” according to Virginia Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger.

Gupta continues to support the Marxist organization Black Lives Matter and said last summer during a House Oversight Hearing that America needs a “shrinking [of] the footprint of the criminal legal system in black and brown peoples’ lives.” Gupta also claimed that we need a “new paradigm” entirely in addressing policing, not merely “reform.” The Biden nominee asserted that government ought to divest funding from police and spend more on entitlements including government health care.

“This approach will not only further equity but also constitute effective policy,” said Gupta. “When we stop using criminal justice policy as social policy, we will make communities safer, and more prosperous.”

Last week, Judicial Crisis Network, Heritage Action for America, and Americans for Public Trust partnered for more than $2 million to run advertisements targeting Gupta’s poor stance on law and order. The ads also targeted Biden secretary of Health and Human Services nominee Xavier Becerra.

“In Vanita Gupta, President Biden has nominated a liberal activist who supports defunding the police and brings to the job her experience leading a left-wing dark money group. President Biden promised to unify and heal this country, but he couldn’t have picked a more divisive figure to help lead the DOJ,” said Carrie Severino, president of Judicial Crisis Network and a Federalist contributor.

“When our cities burned,” the advertisement says, “Gupta could have stood for law and order, for victims. Instead, she advocated to let convicts out of jail. Biden promised unity, but this is a dangerous appointee. And a dangerous time.”

In June, corporations such as Cisco, Intel, Walmart, and Glosser donated about $1.175 billion to “social justice” organizations. Microsoft, who donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which operated to bail out criminals and was endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris, donated an undisclosed amount to Gupta’s far-left interest group. So did Target.

HHS nominee Becerra is testifying this week before the Senate. Gupta’s confirmation hearings in front of the Judiciary Committee have not yet been scheduled.

This HuffPo Reporter Made Up A Police Investigation Into GOP Lawmaker,"Huffington Post congressional reporter Matt Fuller made up a story about Republican Rep. Russ Fulcher being under investigation by Capitol Police over objections to illegal metal detectors set up in front of the House chamber.

Last week, Fuller wrote on Twitter that Capitol Police requested an interview for an investigation into Fulcher “manhandling an officer” outside the metal detectors.

“I saw him very aggressively brush a female officer aside after he set the magnetometer off the night of [Jan. 12],” Fuller reported, with no confirmation.

The first investigation is about Rep. Russ Fulcher manhandling an officer who was at the metal detectors outside the House floor. I saw him very aggressively brush a female officer aside after he set the magnetometer off the night of 1/12. — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 17, 2021

Mind you: This was six days after January 6th, and the first night of the metal detectors outside the House floor. These cops had been through an awful lot, and this Member really was…aggressive. — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 17, 2021

Fuller had also tweeted about the alleged incident on the day he said it occurred, with an indictment of Fulcher.

“Another member — I believe it was Russ Fulcher — just pushed his way through,” Fuller wrote. “He went through the metal detector, set it off, ran into a cop, and then pushed his way past her.”

Another member — I believe it was Russ Fulcher — just pushed his way through. He went through the metal detector, set it off, ran into a cop, and then pushed his way past her. — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 13, 2021

Fulcher had put out a statement on Jan. 13 to condemn the new metal detectors while rejecting Fuller’s reporting.

Yesterday, metal detectors and member screening procedures were initiated at entrances of the House chamber, unauthorized via House rule. Info thus far shows the events on Jan. 6 came from outside, not from members. 2/5 — Rep. Russ Fulcher (@RepRussFulcher) January 13, 2021

Fuller’s tweets generated several stories in major publications, which cited Fuller’s unverified claims of a Capitol Police investigation as their only source, including MSNBC and New York Magazine.

As MSNBC wrote: “The Capitol Police are investigating an incident involving allegations that Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-ID) had assaulted a female officer as he passed through metal detectors outside of the House chamber last month, HuffPost reported late Wednesday.”

New York Magazine promoted Fuller’s tweets at the top of a piece headlined, “House Republicans Disobey Police, Dodge Metal Detectors in Capitol.”

Capitol Police revealed Thursday, however, that no such investigation into Fulcher exists nor has ever existed.

In a formal letter to Fulcher’s office, Capitol Police Chief of Staff Salley Wood debunked Fuller’s made-up reporting and laid to rest the rumor.

“To the Department’s knowledge, there is no current investigation into an alleged or rumored incident occurring on or around the House Floor on January 12, 2021 involving Congressman Fulcher,” Wood wrote.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/02/26/huffington-post-reporter-matt-fuller-makes-up-capitol-police-investigation-into-gop-congressman/,2021-02-26
"Minneapolis Cancels Plan For Floyd Trial PR, But The Idea Won't Go Away","Minneapolis is a city with many distinctions. There the police response to a petty theft committed by a man named George Floyd led to a shocking video and a death that launched a summer of “mostly peaceful” riots and looting throughout the country.

As riots raged out of control in the city, the “defund the police” movement achieved its first great victory when the City Council voted to disband its police force. What followed was ground-zero for a radical experiment and a resulting crime wave that anti-cop politicians blamed on the very police who were being defunded.

Now, Minneapolis sought to break new ground in other respects. City officials understand the upcoming trial of Derek Chauvin — the former police officer who stands accused of Floyd’s murder — presents a particularly difficult challenge for public order. They spent most of last year backing down to the demands of mobs who used Floyd’s death as an excuse for violence and justification for enacting a radical agenda rooted in the pernicious myths of critical race theory.

Unlike the police-defunding debacle, however, Chauvin can’t be convicted by the demands of mobs in the streets. He also can’t be convicted on a vote by City Council members who think citizens expecting police to come when criminals are invading their homes proves “white privilege.”

As such, the city was looking for novel ways to influence public opinion as it seeks to prevent riots if Chauvin isn’t convicted (or, frankly, even if he is). Their answer wasn’t typical among U.S. governments. The city is allocating money to pay for “social influencers” to combat what the administration of beleaguered Mayor Jacob Frey calls “disinformation” that could lead to civil unrest.

A New Level of ‘Astroturfing’

While paying those with social media accounts to promote products or ideas is typical 21st-century marketing, this is the sort of deceptive practice that, when applied to politics and public discussions, has been widely decried as the tactics of totalitarian thugs. It has been used by the Communist government of China to promote support at home and to silence and discredit critics abroad. It takes the practice known as “astroturfing,” in which the sponsors of a particular message are masked behind a false front of manufactured public opinion, to a new level of deceit in a political context.

That is why the pushback against it was so strong, forcing the city to quickly abandon the plan. Yet the city’s decision won’t be the last we’ll hear of the issue.

On the contrary, the real danger now is whether the next attempt by the left to astroturf public opinion will be done in a less open manner. When the business of state-sponsored spin is, instead, done by groups acting at the behest of governments rather than directly paid by them, it will be even harder to both discern and oppose the way leftists — who are increasingly seeking to silence conservative opponents on the internet and cable spectrum — are abusing power.

Frey’s problem was that a fair trial for Chauvin could provoke criticism of the justice system from those who already claim institutional racism pervades all of American society. Even worse for him, the televised proceedings will inevitably broadcast the defense’s case.

Under the circumstances, Chauvin’s lawyers have a daunting assignment. The entire country has seen the video of Floyd’s death, an edited version of which seemingly played continuously in the days and weeks after it happened, meaning a jury pool not only in Minneapolis but anywhere else is already tainted.

Indeed, it’s an open question whether there is a jury in Minneapolis — whose mayor, along with many other national and local public officials, pre-emptively declared Chauvin guilty of murder — prepared to brave the public condemnation that will rain on them if they do anything other than convict Chauvin on all counts.

Despite the seemingly damning video of Chauvin restraining Floyd for nine minutes with his knee on the arrested man’s neck, the toxicology report showed Floyd had what in any other circumstances would have been termed a lethal amount of fentanyl and other drugs in his system. Given other pre-existing conditions including heart disease, sickle cell trait, and COVID-19 — as well as the fact that the full tape of his ordeal shows that he was insisting that he couldn’t breathe well before Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s neck — that gives the defense a fighting chance of, at least, getting the defendant off on the most serious charge of second-degree murder.

If that happens, there is a real threat of a new round of violence, in Minneapolis and elsewhere, that may make last summer’s “mostly peaceful” riots and looting look like a picnic.

A Dangerous Path

But does Frey or anyone in Minneapolis really think even a well-executed social media campaign aimed at stopping the spread of “disinformation” could persuade would-be rioters to stand down? Indeed, Minneapolis’s openness about its attempt to astroturf its citizens doomed the effort.

As much as it is to be hoped Frey will find some way to beguile his citizens to keep the peace by any legal means, there’s a far greater danger in going down this path than just the possibility of violence. For an American government on any level to openly embrace an effort to commission state-sponsored propaganda — even if the intent is to help keep the peace — sends the country down a dangerous path completely contrary to the norms of free discourse in a republic.

Floyd’s death set off a moral panic that fueled outrage mobs and cancel campaigns aimed at revising American history and shunning then silencing anyone who dissented from the new narrative about institutional racism. That trend has made itself felt in the media as well as on college campuses, artistic institutions, and government.

It has helped convince the Silicon Valley oligarchs who more or less own the public information highway to shut down discourse of which they disapprove. This includes the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump and many others, social media platforms friendly to conservatives such as Parler, and news stories that might have altered the outcome of the 2020 election. For governments to now take one more cynical step and pay agents to spread whatever official spin their masters wish further undermines faith in democracy.

For years, manufactured opinion on Twitter has helped drive public discussions in Washington and distorted debates about vital issues in ways that had little to do with the opinions of the public and much to do with what the chattering classes wanted politicians to believe. That has further undermined confidence in the system and created a huge gap between officeholders and their staff and the voters, something that has been particularly evident among the leadership of the Republican Party.

It’s already difficult to know if what we’re seeing online — especially topics highlighted on Twitter as “trending” — represents a genuine surge of interest or just a case of paid influencers or the platform telling us what to think. But if we embark on a new era in which even municipalities astroturf public opinion with campaigns paid with taxpayer dollars, we will be taking one more step into an anti-democratic abyss of cynical spin.

Frey’s tactic was not going to save Minneapolis from more riots, but if other municipal, state, or even federal agencies follow in his footsteps, the next such effort won’t be above board. It will instead — like the efforts to silence conservatives on social media or to kill stories that embarrass Democrats in the name of stopping “disinformation” — be done in a more subtle and less easily exposed manner. Soon, it may well be quite difficult to dissuade disillusioned citizens from thinking that everything they are reading or viewing is the result of a rigged system in which they are increasingly voiceless and powerless.

Congress Should Defund Its Police State At The U.S. Capitol Today,"In the nation’s capital, people walking through Capitol Hill on a warm pre-spring day Wednesday could find multiple signs like this:

The signs show sentiment among Washingtonians against the creeping police state that sprung up in the wake of the January 6 riot at the Capitol—a police state that security authorities want to make permanent.

Thankfully, Congress has just such an opportunity to weigh in on the matter this week. The “vote-a-rama” process on Congress’ latest $1.9 trillion “stimulus” bill will allow senators to offer amendments on any issue, including taking aim at the taxpayer spending on razor wire around the Capitol. If Democratic lawmakers support defunding the police, perhaps they can start by defunding the police state established around the People’s House.

March 4 Threat?

To some, the timing of this proposal may seem inappropriate. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives changed their schedule, completing its work for the week early so the House would not be in session Thursday. The move came after alleged threats to the Capitol on March 4—the presidential inauguration date prior to the passage of the 20th Amendment—by militia groups and others associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory.

The precise nature of this latest threat remains murky. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called it “credible” in a television appearance Wednesday. On the other hand, while taking the general threat “seriously,” law enforcement sources have dismissed as implausible the allegation in a late February FBI bulletin that 50,000 individuals from militia groups will descend on Washington to attack the Capitol this week.

Constantly Extending Restrictions

While it makes perfect sense to enhance security in response to a discrete, credible threat, the Capitol fortifications look increasingly permanent. Many Capitol Hill residents—including this one—didn’t like the massive fences put in place prior to the inauguration, but most tolerated them, given the horrific rioting.

But what became a two-week inconvenience to secure an orderly transfer of power has taken on a distinct sense of “mission creep.” After the inauguration, security officials then claimed they needed to keep the Capitol complex secure for President Trump’s second impeachment trial. Shortly after that trial concluded, the same officials started talking about the need for continued restrictions through September.

Last week, Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman claimed the fencing needs to remain because militia groups have threatened to attack the Capitol during the State of the Union address. Never mind that Congress has not set a date for President Biden to give such an address (technically not a State of the Union message during his first year in office). Never mind too that trying to host such a joint session of Congress in the middle of a pandemic doesn’t exactly jibe with Biden’s COVID messaging.

It appears the Capitol Police have gone from under-policing riots to over-policing, searching for every and any reason to keep the Capitol on permanent lockdown. But for members of Congress and their staff, to say nothing of residents of the Washington area, the perpetually extended restrictions have long since started to grate.

Vote-A-Rama Amendment

The Democrat “stimulus” bill, being considered under budget reconciliation rules in the Senate, provides a potential legislative solution. At the end of debate on a budget reconciliation bill, the Senate proceeds to a “vote-a-rama,” in which senators can offer, and demand votes on, amendments on any number of issues and priorities.

During this process, senators could request a vote on an amendment defunding the fencing and razor wire around the Capitol. Because such an amendment has a greater effect on policy than on government spending, it would likely need 60 votes to pass, consistent with the Senate’s “Byrd rule” for budget reconciliation bills.

Regardless of whether or not such an amendment succeeds—if subject to a 60-vote threshold, it would require at least 10 senators to cross party lines to do so—it would serve a critically important role in clarifying the debate. Pittman and the relevant security authorities that built the fence, and now want to keep it, may think they run Congress. They don’t—the American people, acting through their duly elected members of Congress, do.

It’s long past time for members of Congress to weigh in formally on the Capitol fencing. And if some of them want to support a permanent police state on Capitol Hill—keeping a wall between them and their constituents—the American people will get to express their views on that matter next November.

"Pelosi's Left-Wing Security Czar Demands More Fencing, Troops, And Money For Capitol 'Security'","Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s pick to lead a Capitol security investigation in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot is recommending that Congress step up measures to bring in more fencing and more officers and to establish a full-time task force to guard the historic building that will cost up to $130 million a year.

After conducting a six-week reportedly “nonpartisan” investigation, Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré, who previously received backlash for hurling multiple partisan insults at congressional Republicans, even calling for some such as Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz to “be run out of DC and Disbarred ASAP,” concluded in a report obtained by Fox News that the Capitol needs a “quick reaction force” that will always be on guard. The decision, the report states, follows the “understaffed, insufficiently equipped, and inadequately trained” police meant to protect the Capitol on Jan. 6 and comes even though National Guardsmen are scheduled to remain in Washington, D.C., for at least two more months.

BREAKING: Capitol Police ask that the National Guard remain at the U.S. Capitol for two more months, reflecting continued security concerns. https://t.co/SdYJE6W5gh — The Associated Press (@AP) March 4, 2021

The “quick reaction force,” the 33-page report states, can consist of either “existing law enforcement entities,” instated under the D.C. National Guard or a rotation of Guardsmen from around the country, or be created as a group “that permanently resides within the DC Guard by reestablishing a military police battalion and staffing it with Active Guard Reserve troops who live in or near the city year-round, perpetually on active duty.”

In addition to a 24-hour reaction force, the report also recommends installing a “mobile fence option” around Capitol grounds that can be “easily erected and deconstructed.” Repairs to the building itself, the report notes, should also be made a priority to ensure “long-term improvements to perimeter fencing and security surveillance sensing systems.”

Other suggestions from Honoré’s report include allocating resources to U.S. Capitol Police to hire and train nearly 900 more officers to its force to fill 223 vacancies as well as equip them with earpieces, body cameras, a young and trained K-9 unit, and horses. The hiring spree, the report states, should also provide more flexibility to the Capitol Police after officers clocked more than 720,000 overtime hours in the 2020 fiscal year. Training for these officers, the report emphasizes, should include how to communicate, strategize, and discern intelligence.

“Internal communications were a problem during the attack in part because the USCP failed to use ‘talk groups’ on the radio, which would have allowed leaders to bypass the constant, high-volume tactical chatter to communicate without the interruption of other radio traffic,” the report notes.

The Capitol Hill police chief, Honoré noted, should also be granted more authority to make decisions during a crisis.

“The CPB’s deliberate decision-making process proved too slow and cumbersome to respond to the crisis in January, delaying requests for critical supplemental resources,” the report states. “Specifically, the USCP Chief should not require CPB approval to request assistance from external agencies or the National Guard in an emergency.” Lastly, the report suggests Capitol Police implement new screening procedures and background checks of people entering the building.

“Requiring background checks for identification cardholders and employing card readers more widely throughout the complex would decrease insider threat risks,” the report states. The task force also recommends Capitol Police take into account the risks to lawmakers’ offices on Capitol grounds as well as promote “residential security systems for all members of Congress.”

Capitol Police Chief And Democrats Are Lying To Hold Our Capital Hostage,"WASHINGTON — My city has been occupied for more than eight weeks. Major thoroughfares blocked, thousands of armed soldiers, armored vehicles, seven-foot fencing, concertina wire.

What’s it all for? An invading army across the Potomac? Rising far-right militias, ready to strike at any moment?

Nope. It’s because when angry rioters and protesters attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, a Capitol Police force hobbled by its leadership’s poor training regimens, nearly non-existent fitness standards, and fecklessness in the face of crisis were incapable of protecting the building or even shutting the big doors on time.

It’s because those idiot rioters had finally — after months and years of left-wing riots here and across the country — finally given Democratic lawmakers and the corporate media the right-wing riot they always claimed was around the corner.

It’s because panic porn and agitprop are useful tools when you’re working as hard as you can to spread fear and distrust against the half of the country that disagrees with your policies.

And it’s because acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman is perfectly content to use her own men and women as political pawns and scapegoats to please her new Democratic bosses.

Just as with “two weeks to slow the spread,” on Capitol Hill we were told one month to stop the “insurrection.” Then three weeks in, the acting Capitol Police chief requested that fencing remain permanently, a sort of replacement for providing the training and enforcing the standards that are expected of police departments across America.

In the following weeks, reporters at outlets like Politico thirstily spread rumors from unnamed “Guard members” that March 4 was the day the militias would finally come back. Except this time, instead of tens of thousands of people flying and driving to the capital for a widely advertised protest with nearly zero preparation for crowd control, there was internet “chatter” about something maybe happening to a building people can’t walk within 100 yards of because it’s surrounded with razor wire and thousands of National Guardsmen.

While headlines like “Capitol Police Say Intelligence Shows Militia Group May Be Plotting To Breach The Capitol” ran in The Washington Post, readers who got seven paragraphs down learn the FBI actually didn’t “have any indication of violence or a specific, credible plot at this time” — the kind of fact that might cause more intelligent or honest journalists to wonder what “intelligence sources” the Capitol Police were citing. None of that got in the way, of course.

And none of it got in the way of acting Chief Pittman, who requested Thursday that the occupation be extended a further two months after the men and women of the National Guard are slated to finally return to their homes, families, and lives.

None of it is enough. While the men and women of the Armed Forces — men and women who could be helping at the border, distributing vaccines, home with their children, or literally anywhere but Washington — lined the halls and stood guard outside against an imaginary army that couldn’t get within 100 yards in any direction, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi warned lawmakers to scurry among the tunnels beneath the Capitol instead of walking the halls like adults.

Because “chatter.” If terror attack “chatter” sounds familiar, it’s because you remember 9/11. Same thing, right?

“I plan on going in,” one senior Republican staffer told The Federalist Thursday morning. “Given the Army trucks, soldiers with guns, and barbed wire fences I can’t bring myself to take the left seriously when they tell me that a guy from Indiana is going to show up and be real mad about something he read on Reddit.”

But it doesn’t matter to the leadership in Congress or Pittman. What matters is the narrative.

George Floyd Policing Act Is A Mix Of Anti-Cop Buzzwords That Wouldn't Make Anyone Safer,"The House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021 on Wednesday with the hopes that it would rein in police violence against minorities as well as prevent law enforcement misconduct.

The legislation seeks to be a federal response to the deaths of Floyd and other black Americans such as Breonna Taylor, Daniel Prude, and Rayshard Brooks by overhauling the current definition of qualified immunity for police forces, creating a national database of police misconduct to prevent law enforcement officers who have failed to follow policy from getting new jobs in different departments, requiring the use of dash and body cameras, prohibiting racial profiling, banning chokeholds, and other provisions. If states or police departments fail to comply with the new measures, they would face penalties including losing federal funding, a financial practice often used by the federal government to avoid violating the state powers outlined in the 10th Amendment.

While the legislation is championed by Democrats including the president as a step in the right direction to prevent police brutality, with some even saying it is the beginning of upending “systemic racism,” the policing act faces multiple hurdles before it even gets a shot to be implemented.

Only one House Republican, Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, voted in favor of the bill on Wednesday, a move he later corrected on the official record, saying he accidentally pushed the wrong voting button. The lack of GOP support in the House leaves Democrats scrambling to fight GOP opposition in the Senate, especially after leftist politicians snubbed Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and other Republicans who tried to pass police reforms last summer.

The bill also faces scrutiny from various experts, people involved in law enforcement, and even some progressives for not fully or properly addressing some of the policing methods used by law enforcement departments across the nation. As one activist noted, the measures addressed in the bill don’t correlate with Floyd’s death.

“Floyd did not die from a chokehold,” wrote columnist and activist Derecka Purnell in The Guardian, also noting that Floyd was not necessarily racially profiled, both actions that receive attention and regulation in the new legislation.

Rafael Mangual, a senior fellow and deputy director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute, also noted that while police reform is something to examine, the bill is either “misguided” or “reflects a kind of oversimplification or overstated case with respect to the need for certain kinds of reforms.”

“Take the ban on chokeholds for example,” Mangual told The Federalist. “Obviously no one wants to see excessive force used on anyone when it’s not necessary, but the mere fact that we’ve had a handful of controversial cases involving chokeholds, I’m not sure that that should justify a blanket ban, particularly when you consider the fact that there are going to be situations in which using that kind of neck restraint could probably mean less force than what might otherwise end up being used because an effective grappling technique was taken off the table. … Proposals like that kind of failed to appreciate some of the nuance involved in policing.”

The same concept, Mangual said, applies to the qualified immunity doctrine included in the bill Democrats are pushing.

“No one wants to see legal doctrines abused to offer protection to people who don’t deserve it,” he said. “But if you dig down into the data, the reality is that qualified immunity just doesn’t seem like a particularly enabling doctrine with respect to law enforcement behavior.”

Other experts are warning that the new definition for qualified immunity could hurt local law enforcement agencies and police unions, which have garnered support from President Joe Biden in the past. When the previous version of the policing bill made its way to the House last summer, the National Association of Police Organizations wrote a letter to members of Congress urging them to reject it over fears that the modified version of qualified immunity would “make it easier to prosecute police officers for minor mistakes that they make on the job.”

“With the change to qualified immunity, an officer can go to prison for an unintentional act that unknowingly broke an unknown law. We believe in holding officers accountable for their actions, but the consequence of this would be making criminals out of decent cops enforcing the laws in good faith,” the letter stated.

If the legislation passes the Senate, it will most likely be months before changes are implemented in states and local police departments due to the slow bureaucratic nature associated with federal laws.

Biden DOJ Nominee Flip Flops On 'Defunding The Police' Rhetoric,"During her confirmation hearing Tuesday morning, President Joe Biden’s Associate Attorney General nominee Vanita Gupta insisted that she does not support “defunding the police,” although statements she made last summer would indicate otherwise.

“I do not support defunding the police. I have, in fact, spent my career advocating, where it’s been necessary, for greater resources for law enforcement for things like body-worn cameras, officer wellness, and safety programs, and any number of measures,” Gupta said Tuesday.

Gupta’s new assertion contradicts her testimony in June before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which she proposed a “shrinking [of] the footprint of the criminal legal system, including police, in black and brown people’s lives,” among other statements.

“It means shifting our approach to public safety away from exclusive investments in criminalization and policing, toward investments in economic opportunity, education, health care, and other public benefits,” Gupta said. “This paradigm not only furthers equity, but also constitutes effective policy: When we stop using criminal “justice” policy as social policy, we make communities safer and more prosperous.”

“Ultimately, it is becoming clear that Congress must redirect government dollars away from policing practices rooted in the criminal-legal system and the carceral state, and toward policy goals that reflect a vision of public safety that promotes community health and safety,” Gupta also said in June.

Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas pressed the Biden nominee on her prior “defund the police” rhetoric, attempting to get a clear answer of Gupta’s legitimate position.

“Were the quotes I read inaccurate?” Cruz asked Gupta.

CONFIRMATIONS: Sen. @tedcruz grills Vanita Gupta, nominee for Justice Department, on “defund the police” position. pic.twitter.com/nx3I0kIoJX — Forbes (@Forbes) March 9, 2021

“Those statements reflect conversations that I’ve had with sheriffs across the country, police officers, police chiefs, civil rights activists, who have been talking to me for years … We have placed so many of our nation’s social problems at the feet of police … We have expected law enforcement to be the only go-to solution,” Gupta responded to Cruz. “…This is an issue that unified law enforcement and civil rights advocates, and unity leaders, who are seeking alternatives to incarceration.”

In a 416-page report published in March by Gupta’s interest group, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, she argued for “community policing” and the banning of law enforcement from schools. The report states:

A community policing model may require changes in departments’ staffing levels, deployment patterns, and the like, which can require cutting costs, raising additional funds, and/or using resources more efficiently. Studies suggest that insufficient resources and/or inefficient resource allocation block effective implementation of community policing initiatives. Fortunately, departments don’t necessarily need additional funds to implement community policing initiatives; they may be able to secure adequate funding by reallocating or reinvesting existing resources. As such, government bodies that oversee police departments and department leadership should ensure that departments are using resources efficiently to promote community policing and that they are allocated equitably across neighborhoods served by departments.

On March 1, five attorneys general from Indiana, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma urged Biden in a letter to withdraw the Gupta nomination. The letter alluded to Gupta’s poor stance on law and order and prior calls to “defund the police.”

Gupta’s confirmation hearings this week in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue to zone in on her controversial rhetoric before and after the summer Antifa riots.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/09/biden-doj-nominee-vanita-gupta-flip-flops-on-defunding-the-police-rhetoric-during-confirmation-hearing/,2021-03-09
Morally Bankrupt Left Wants You To Forget About The Summer Of Riots,"A CNN article titled “What Jim Crow looks like in 2021” by columnist Nicole Hemmer last Friday perfectly encapsulates the left’s tactical lawlessness and disorder gaslighting. “And while it may still wear a suit and tie,” Hemmer wrote, claiming Jim Crow is alive and well, “it also still marches hand in hand with both state violence and mob violence, as we were once again reminded during the insurrection at the Capitol.”

Aside from making the astounding and flat-out false claim that Republicans are similar to segregationists for opposing a bill that would eliminate election security, Hemmer’s piece reiterates one of the Democratic Party’s favorite talking points: that the GOP is supposedly composed of white supremacists broadly committing violence, while the virtuous left peacefully protests in the name of social justice. This is an evil lie.

Anyone with two eyes knows what went down last summer in response to the death of George Floyd. Data sets first reported by Axios in September estimated that the Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioting and looting carried a price tag of as much as $2 billion. This effectively makes the 20 states where it occurred the carriers for the most expensive manmade insurance damage in U.S. history, ahead of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 after the acquittal of four officers for beating Rodney King.

On June 1 alone, the Washington, D.C. police arrested more than 300 BLM and Antifa activists. According to Metropolitan Police Department data, D.C. police arrested more than five times as many protesters compared to the 61 arrests for the Capitol riot on the day it occurred, which corporate media insisted was the result of law enforcement actively encouraging “white supremacy,” a charge not grounded in reality.

Nevertheless, the media side-stepped per usual to construct a baseless plot that fit its preferred narrative that any social justice demonstration, regardless of the outcome, is a moral one. Hemmer and her morally bankrupt allies are under the impression that the Capitol breach was an “insurrection,” whereas the modest estimate of $1 to 2 billion in property damage due to BLM and Antifa riots can best be described as “mostly peaceful” or “non-violent.”

A report from Politico on Tuesday said what right-leaning media knew for months — but what all of America needs to hear. The supposed insurrectionists who participated in the unruly Capitol breach have overwhelmingly been charged with trespassing.

“The prospect of dozens of Jan. 6 rioters cutting deals for minor sentences could be hard to explain for the Biden administration, which has characterized the Capitol Hill mob as a uniquely dangerous threat,” writes Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney.

“That reckoning is coming sooner rather than later, lawyers say, putting prosecutors in the position of wrist-slapping many participants in the riot despite framing the crimes as part of an insurrection that presented a grave threat to American democracy,” the reporters add.

The corporate media has overwhelmingly pushed the opposite narrative, in addition to its trivializing of the clear facts that leftist activists committed far worse acts for far longer — such as burning down police stations, using $35 million to bail out sex offenders and other criminals, and killing innocent children.

“Activists in DC said they were shocked that a deadly assault on the heart of American democracy led to far fewer people in police custody than the clashes that erupted during protests over law enforcement brutality,” said one CNN article. “The Capitol attack was also deadlier than the summer protests.”

“For months, Republicans have used last summer’s protests as a political catchall, highlighting isolated instances of property destruction and calls to defund the police to motivate their base in November,” the New York Times said.

“The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful and leading BLM activists repeatedly distanced themselves from agent provocateurs and instigators,” ABC claimed. “Non-violent protesters during the summer faced brute force from federal officers, but rioters were met with minimal federal response.”

“Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough on MSNBC mostly reiterated this doublespeak in February, claiming the billion-dollar BLM vandalizing is not equatable in magnitude to the one-day Capitol breach. “I know there are idiots on other cable news channels that will say, ‘Well, this mom-and-pop store was vandalized during the summer riots and that’s just as bad as the United States Capitol being vandalized.’ No. No, actually no, jack-sses, it’s not,” Scarborough said. “I’m not going to confuse a taco stand with the United States Capitol.”

Scarborough is contrarily spot-on about the fact that what happened at the Capitol cannot be equated to the summer of BLM and Antifa rioting and looting. The latter was significantly worse. Five people died at the Capitol, of which at least two died from natural causes. According to a running list, there have been 32 BLM and Antifa riot-associated deaths, meaning CNN’s claim that the “Capitol attack was also deadlier than the summer protests” is a bald-faced lie.

Victims of the deadly summer riots include David Dorn, a black retired police officer who was shot and killed when he tried to protect a pawnshop during a break-in, 8-year-old Secoriea Turner killed in Atlanta by armed rioters, and 24-year-old mother Jessica Doty-Whitaker murdered while walking by an armed group of BLM rioters who yelled at her to join in their chanting. They also include 38-year-old Christopher Beaty, a black male in Indianapolis trying to stop a group of militant teenagers from looting, and 50-year-old Marvin Francois, who was shot when two rioters jumped on his Jeep out of nowhere. This only touches the surface of the tragedies.

There is no competition between what happened in D.C. versus what happened across the country for months on end. All violence ought to be denounced, but the left has operated in an eerie vacuum since the beginning of the BLM riots — attempting to claim a moral high ground and telling the American people that their actions were for a noble cause.

Standing before a building on fire in Minneapolis in May, for instance, MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi committed a brazen act of journalistic malfeasance.

“I want to be clear in how I characterize this,” Velshi said, as the flames stoked behind him and the mob responsible watched. “This is mostly a protest. It is not generally speaking unruly.”

The left’s immorality continued to be on full display. CNN national correspondent Omar Jimenez stood before the enflamed streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August after the shooting of Jacob Blake while the chyron read, “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.”

The reality is that all of the lies, the gaslighting, the manipulation of truth — it all boils down to the left’s quest for total control over the information you take in and your resulting worldview. To our ruling class, BLM and Antifa are just an “idea” and not composed of domestic terrorists working to unravel our social fabric (which they are).

“They will come into our schools, they come into our churches, they will come into our social media, our place of employment, our private company, our home, and our family,” Federalist Senior Editor Chris Bedford writes of the left. “The real question is: How far will we let them come? Because no one else is going to stand up for us.”

The corporate media thinks you are stupid. They think you will roll over and play nice and sing hallelujah because Joe Biden is president and he is promising “unity.” After all, isn’t it a “time to heal?” Since elites in the morally bankrupt Zoom cubicles of corporate America will not stand for truth, it is up to you to do so.

"Capitol Police Officer, Suspect Dead After Car Rams Into Capitol Barrier","Two people are dead after a male suspect drove into a U.S. Capitol barricade Friday, striking two officers before getting shot as he exited his vehicle “with a knife in hand.”

According to the acting chief of the U.S. Capitol Police Yogananda Pittman, the officers at the scene engaged the suspect” but reported that “he did not respond to verbal commands.”

“The suspect did start lunging toward US Capitol Police officers, at which time US Capitol Police officers fired upon the suspect,” she explained. “At this time the suspect has been pronounced deceased.”

One Capitol Police officer is also dead following the incident. While authorities reported that “at least one of the officers was stabbed,” it is unclear why the officer “succumbed to his injuries.” The second Capitol Police officer remains in the hospital in critical condition.

While Congres is currently in recess and President Joe Biden had already departed from the White House to Camp David, the Capitol complex was quickly placed on lockdown following the shooting and members of the National Guard were deployed to the area to provide extra security.

While Capitol security was heightened following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, authorities said that the incident appears to be unrelated. The acting chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Robert Contee also assured the public that the attack “does not appear to be terrorism-related,” but that an investigation is underway.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ordered Capitol flags to be flown at half-staff in observance of the officer’s death and the president is reportedly “aware” of the situation.

Speaker Pelosi has ordered the flags at the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff due to the death of a U.S. Capitol Police Officer in the of duty today. The process of lowering the flags may take longer than usual because of the Capitol’s current lockdown status. — Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) April 2, 2021

As of 3:27 p.m. EST, the Capitol lockdown concluded and staffers were ordered to “follow police direction.”

"Biden Caves To Left, Axes Police Reform Study For Immediate Action","President Joe Biden is shelving a new commission to study police reform in favor of an immediate push to pass left-wing legislation through Congress, Politico reported Sunday.

Biden’s director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, Susan Rice, who has been tasked with “rooting out systemic racism” as a focal point of her duties told Politico the administration’s top priority has shifted to passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

“Based on close, respectful consultation with partners in the civil rights community, the administration made the considered judgement that a police commission, at this time, would not be the most effective way to deliver on our top priority in this area, which is to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,” Rice told the magazine. The police commission was a primary campaign pledge from the former vice president on the trail.

The bill introduced by California Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass, who was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus from 2019 to 2021, passed the House last month primarily along party lines, with one Republican voting for and two Democrats voting against. The law lowers standards to prosecute police officers and places new restrictions on use of force and no-knock warrants.

Bass also introduced the legislation last summer in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who’s ongoing trial this month has increased fear of another outbreak of civil unrest. Two weeks of nationwide rioting last year wrecked an estimated $1 to $2 billion in damage over 14 days alone in what’s become the most explosive series of riots in 70 years. The estimate from Property Claims Services (PCS) marks the Floyd riots 66 times more destructive than the Capitol riot in January.

The bill proposed by Democrats and championed by the White House also creates a national database of police misconduct to prevent officers from employment in other agencies, requires the use of dashcams and body cameras, bans chokeholds, and implements mandated racial sensitivity training. States and municipalities found non-compliant with the law would lose federal funding.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/12/biden-caves-to-left-axes-police-reform-study-for-immediate-activist-action/,2021-04-12
"National Guard Responds To Minneapolis Riots, Looting After Fatal Shooting Of Black Man","The Minnesota National Guard arrived in a Minneapolis suburb on Sunday after the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old black man sparked riots and looting in the city.

Brooklyn Center Police released a statement on Sunday explaining that a police officer shot Daunte Wright, who had an outstanding warrant for possessing a firearm without a permit last June, after he evaded arrest during a traffic stop and drove away. Reports suggest that the vehicle, which also held a female passenger believed to be Wright’s girlfriend, “traveled several blocks before crashing into another vehicle.”

Wright’s mother disputed these reports after she said Wright called her as he was pulled over but abruptly hung up after someone said “Daunte, don’t run.”

“All he did was have air fresheners in the car, and they told him to get out of the car,” Katie Wright said.

Shortly after the incident, agitated crowds carrying Black Lives Matter flags and signs gathered at the scene to protest the shooting by attacking police cars, scuffling with officers in riot gear, and throwing various objects at police while threatening to keep the rioting going “all summer like it did last time.” Other rioters covered the Brooklyn Center police department building with graffiti and Wright’s name prompting law enforcement to deploy “tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets on the crowd.”

Wright’s mother also urged rioters to abstain from violence, but to no avail.

“All the violence, if it keeps going it’s only going to be about the violence. We need it to be about why my son got shot for no reason,” she said to a crowd near the shooting scene. “We need to make sure it’s about him and not about smashing police cars, because that’s not going to bring my son back.”

Hundreds of people looted and rampaged more than 20 businesses amidst the violent unrest including a Foot Locker, Walmart, O’Reilly Auto Parts, and Family Dollar.

Even though Brooklyn Center Police “did not immediately identify Wright or disclose his race,” Democrat Gov. Tim Walz tweeted that he joined the state in mourning “another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.”

The rioting comes less than one year after violent destruction in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with Floyd’s death, is currently facing the third week of his trial.

"Brooklyn Center Cop, Police Chief Resign After Fatal Shooting","The Brooklyn Center, Minnesota officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 22-year-old black male, on Sunday announced her resignation in a letter on Tuesday.

Kim Potter, the 48-year-old officer who served in the department for 26 years, was previously placed on administrative leave after she reportedly shot Wright on accident, instead of using her taser. Officers originally pulled over Wright during a traffic stop but when they attempted to arrest him for an outstanding warrant, he drove away and crashed into another vehicle.

“I have loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability, but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately,” Potter wrote in her resignation.

According to the Associated Press, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said he was “appreciative that Potter submitted her resignation but that he had not asked for it nor accepted it.”

Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon, the officer who claimed that Potter shot Wright on accident, also resigned on Tuesday. His resignation follows a charged press conference where he sparred with reporters who tried to stop him from calling the destruction and violence outside of Minneapolis on Sunday a riot.

In response to Wright’s death, people in Minneapolis took to the streets wreaking havoc on the city with rioting and looting. On Sunday, mere hours after Wright was shot, the Minnesota National Guard arrived in the Minneapolis suburb to assist law enforcement with controlling agitated Black Lives Matter crowds who were attacking police cars, scuffling with officers in riot gear, and throwing various objects at police while threatening to keep the rioting going “all summer like it did last time.”

Other rioters covered the Brooklyn Center police department building with graffiti and Wright’s name prompting law enforcement to deploy “tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets on the crowd.”

YouTuber and former Tucson Police Officer Brandon Tatum said he believes the shooting was an “honest mistake in a heated situation caused by Mr. Wright,” but that Potter should lose her job because she “doesn’t have the temperament.”

70+ Rioters Arrested Near Minneapolis Tuesday After Daunte Wright's Death,"Nearly 80 rioters were arrested in the Minneapolis suburb Brooklyn Center, Minnesota on Tuesday evening in connection to continued unrest after the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright.

Demonstrations began at 4:30 p.m. and branched outward from the initial location in front of the police station. An estimated 800 to 1,000 people clashed with police in full riot gear, with law enforcers using riot gas, projectiles, and flash-bang grenades to try to quell the unrest. Forty people were arrested the night prior.

“The behaviors we continue to see are unacceptable, and we are not going to tolerate them,” State Patrol Col. Matt Langer said. “We encourage you to be peaceful and come and exercise your First Amendment rights. It is not acceptable and will not be tolerated if you choose to come and do criminal activity and destroy property and throw objects and make it unsafe for people to come and exercise your First Amendment rights.”

Despite the mayor instituting a 10:00 p.m. curfew, at midnight, it was confirmed that rioters were launching cans and bricks at law enforcement. An hour prior, Operation Safety Net, a law enforcement coalition formed to promote safety after the death of George Floyd, reported that people were throwing bottles and bricks in addition to spraying mace in officers’ faces. This was the third night of riots.

At midnight, the National Guard trickled into the Minneapolis suburb. “We want to make sure everyone is safe,” Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott tweeted. “Please be safe and please go home.”

As demonstrators threw projectiles and attempted to storm the Brooklyn Center police station, one video shows Black Lives Matter protesters demanding that white people be moved to the front of the line to act as human shields against law enforcement in riot gear.

Police officers pulled over Wright on Sunday for a traffic infraction. Upon conducting a background check, they learned there was a warrant out for Wright’s arrest, which was related to an attempt at aggravated armed robbery. Police attempted to arrest Wright, but fatally shot him after he resisted and reentered his vehicle. The Minnesota police chief says the officer intended to use a taser. A prosecutor in Minnesota has said he will charge the police officer who killed Wright with second-degree manslaughter.

Black City Manager Fired For Saying Officer Who Shot Daunte Wright Deserves ‘Due Process’,"Former City Manager Curt Boganey of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, which borders Minneapolis, was let go on Monday after he publicly stated that the police officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright should receive “due process” and a full investigation instead of being fired immediately.

“Effective immediately our city manager has been relieved of his duties, and the deputy city manager will be assuming his duties moving forward. I will continue to work my hardest to ensure good leadership at all levels of our city government,” Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott wrote on Twitter after all but one of the City Council members voted to oust Boganey. One councilwoman, Kris Lawrence-Anderson, said she “didn’t want repercussions at a personal level” if she voted to keep Boganey.

https://twitter.com/mayor_elliott/status/1381737520933797899?s=20

Elliott announced Boganey’s dismissal after the city manager refused to comply with the mayor’s public plea for police officer Kim Potter to be fired after she reportedly fired her gun instead of using her taser on Wright during a traffic stop.

“Let me be very clear — my position is that we cannot afford to make mistakes that lead to the loss of life of other people and in our profession,” Elliott said during a Monday press conference. “I do fully support releasing the officer of her duties.”

Boganey, who is black, served as the city manager for more than 15 years where he had the authority to make personnel decisions regarding the city’s police department. One day after he was fired, Potter and Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon, the officer who said Potter shot Wright on accident, both resigned.

“I have loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability, but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately,” Potter wrote in her resignation letter after she was placed on administrative leave.

Since Wright’s death on Sunday, hundreds of people in the Minneapolis suburb took to the streets to wreak havoc on the city with rioting and looting. On Tuesday night, local news reported that more than 60 people were arrested for “riot and other criminal behaviors.” Officers near the Brooklyn Center police station reportedly used pepper spray and other munitions to fend off rioters who threw objects at the police and yelled about justice for Wright.

Chris Hayes Dismisses Routine Left-Wing Riots To Portray Double Standard In Protest Policing,"MSNBC prime time host Chris Hayes painted a double-standard in riot policing Wednesday night with depictions of law enforcement clearing a peaceful Colorado vigil last summer compared to Capitol rioters allowed to walk right through the complex past several checkpoints in January.

“Just look for a moment at the utter inversion of what happened on the steps of the Capitol in January,” Hayes said. “There was hardly any police presence at all … There was relatively speaking, no one there.”

Hayes spoke on the heels of a new report from Capitol Police inspector general which documented broad failures among top law enforcement officers faulting officials for inadequate preparedness and orders to stand down as the virulent mob overwhelmed the ill-equipped force left to defend the complex.

“The report finds the Capitol Police were warned three days before the threat,” Hayes said. “They were specifically warned and they did not prepare. They did not prepare the way they prepare for just about every protest we’ve seen police at.”

Hayes charged the lack of preparedness as another product of racism, glossing over the fact repeated outbursts of political violence for much of the prior 12 months had come from militant social justice warriors and not armed Trump supporters.

While Hayes called the protests on the Capitol were called an “insurrection,” his monologue failed to mention the armed, prolonged assault on a federal courthouse in Portland that lasted for weeks and injured hundreds of officers last year. That same courthouse was attacked again in March.

On whether the Capitol police should have been more prepared, agreement is nearly universal. But when comparing the events at the Capitol this year to 2020’s summer of rage, Hayes exemplifies the double-standard often applied.

Hayes’ claim Capitol rioters were met with police pacifism compared to the millions protesting for supposed social justice last year is pure gaslighting, and ignores the routine outbursts of domestic terrorism that swept the nation’s cities for months on end, all provoked by leftist deceptions of white supremacy.

In Minneapolis, police retreated from their precinct building. Rioters burned it down while a reporter from Hayes’ own network characterized the carnage on air behind him as “mostly a protest,” that is “not, generally speaking, unruly.”

Just this week, demonstrators in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center danced atop police cars in the middle of the street as a new wave of chaos retraumatized a city still recovering from last year’s devastating riots. The Sunday spectacle, which came after the fatal police shooting of 20-year-old Duante Wright, who was black, marked the first of three more consecutive nights of rioting in the Twin Cities to preview another summer of rage.

Happening now in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota following an officer-involved shooting:

Hayes did address the violence of last year’s riots, only to dismiss them as isolated incidents among the nationwide protests which pulled millions to the streets.

“It is true, we should be clear, that there are examples, they are documented, you can find video, of violence by those and other protesters, examples of lawlessness and property damage throughout the country in the context of tens of thousands of protesters,” Hayes said, but emphasized, “only a small percentage of people were violent.”

The map below, however, shows no small population of riotous demonstrators who devasted communities in nearly 220 locations across the country. These were all before Jacob Blake was shot in Kenosha, Wis., the week of the Republican National Convention (RNC) which sparked another outburst of terrorism across the nation. At the end of the RNC, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul and his wife were ambushed as he left the White House.

The destruction left behind just within the two weeks after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody last summer totaled 66 times more than the damage at the Capitol in January.

Meanwhile, not all police at the Capitol acted as mere bystanders. Many present at the Capitol that day, including both police and protestors were injured, and one was even killed.

In the fatal shooting of rioter Ashli Babbitt, another double-standard persists where the identity of the officer who shot her remains unknown. In any other highly publicized shooting, the name of the officer involved is almost immediately revealed regardless of whether circumstances justified the use of force. Yet, more than four months later, the identity of Babbitt’s shooter is under lock and key.

Characteristically, in what has become more common among the American elite, Hayes’ coverage appears to place a far higher priority on the offices of politicians than the small businesses down the street torn apart by the rioters, because the owners were complicit in white supremacy, or something.

Yes, the Capitol Police should have been better prepared for a day of protest in Washington D.C. It’s tragic they weren’t. Police leadership was rightly fired. But the fact is, scenes of political eruption are intensely chaotic, and the actions of the Capitol Police on a single day don’t represent the bias Hayes proclaimed with cherry-picked footage to advance a preconceived narrative.

Oregon Newspaper: Man Fatally Shot By Police Was White So There’s No Reason To Riot,"An Oregon newspaper included the race of a white man who was fatally shot by police in its coverage, then clarified it felt his race was important “in light of social unrest prompted by police shootings of Black people.”

“Recent shootings include Daunte Wright, who was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb earlier this week, and two killings in Clark County in recent months,” the newspaper explained, nodding to the fact that those fatal shootings sparked rioting, looting, and other destruction.

Hours after it was published, however, The Oregonian deleted the paragraph and the tweet quoting it after the paper claimed the original statement was “poorly worded.”

“We included information in an earlier tweet about why we identified the victim’s race that was poorly worded. It was not intended to minimize what happened, only to provide context. We generally do not identify race in news stories but often do when reporting police shootings,” the newspaper’s clarification tweet stated.

We included information in an earlier tweet about why we identified the victim’s race that was poorly worded. It was not intended to minimize what happened, only to provide context. We generally do not identify race in news stories but often do when reporting police shootings. — The Oregonian (@Oregonian) April 16, 2021

In the original story, The Oregonian reported that Portland police fatally shot a white male in his 30s on Friday morning after they received calls that someone at a public park had a gun. The man’s race, the newspaper claimed, was important because of the current social climate. The new paragraph instead states that “there have been several high profile fatal police shootings of Black men” recently but “the victim in this case was a white man in his 30s.”

Despite The Oregonian’s attempts to frame the story by clarifying the man’s race to avoid “social unrest,” crowds still gathered at the park on Friday to condemn the deadly shooting. Their cries for “justice now,” according to The Oregonian, were met with “a dozen officers who had donned riot gear.”

“Police told protesters over a loudspeaker to leave the area or risk arrest,” The Oregonian reported.

The race characterization by the newspaper also received backlash on social media by people who quickly saw the irony in the statement.

Maxine Waters Demanded Police Motorcade And Escort Before Calling For Violence At Anti-Police Event,"Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters of California requested an armed police escort to an anti-police protest in a Minneapolis suburb this weekend, reported Townhall. While at the event, Waters called for riots if former police officer Derek Chauvin is not found guilty for the murder of George Floyd.

U.S. Capitol police reportedly put in the request for police to accompany Waters on her trip to Minnesota to rile up demonstrators and urge them to “get more confrontational.”

Waters, who plans to stay in Minnesota through when the jury delivers a verdict, also encouraged rioters to “stay on the street” and “get more active.”

“We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business,” the representative from California said.

Mere hours after Waters made her speech, two Minnesota National Guard members sustained injuries from a drive-by shooting. As noted by The Federalist, “the largest corporate outlets drew no connection between Waters’ rhetoric and the ensuing violence” despite their willingness to do so with former President Donald Trump.

Waters has received backlash in the past for encouraging people to confront Trump supporters and anyone in his administration “in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station … and tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” She defended her most recent comments by shifting the blame on Republicans for using her rhetoric to “fit their message and their cause for denouncing us and denying us.”

“Any time they see an opportunity to seize on a word, so they do it and they send a message to all of the white supremacists, the KKK, the Oath Keepers, the [Proud] Boys and all of that …,” Waters said on Monday. “This is a time for [Republicans] to keep telling our constituents that [Democrats] are the enemy and they do that time and time again. But that does not deter me from speaking truth to power. I am not intimidated. I am not afraid, and I do what needs to be done.”

In a now-deleted tweet, the famous NBA player posted a picture of the alleged Columbus officer involved in the fatal shooting captioned with the words “YOU’RE NEXT” and “#ACCOUNTABILITY.” James removed the post but it still received more than 6,000 retweets in the short amount of time it circulated Twitter.

The White House, aided by the corporate media, also spun the incident to claim without evidence that the officer who shot the black teenage girl was motivated by racism.

“She was a child,” the White House wrote in a Wednesday statement on the shooting. “We know that police violence disproportionately impacts Black and Latino people and communities and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence.”

Bodycam footage of the Tuesday shooting that occurred shortly after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty in George Floyd’s death, however, shows Ma’Khia Bryant, believed to be 15 or 16, charging two people with a knife. As she moved towards another black girl, the police officer called for everyone to get down and then fired off four shots. Bryant was transported to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.

“We know based on this footage the officer took action to protect another young girl in our community,” Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther told reporters.

There’s No Way Americans Can Trust The Jury’s Chauvin Verdict,"A Minnesota jury has found former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. This means they claim to have concluded that they unanimously believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death.

Given the circumstances of the trial, however, it’s extremely hard to believe the jury was solely concerned with either truth or justice. It’s extremely hard, if not impossible, for any thinking person not to have a reasonable doubt about the outcome.

We know the judge in the case refused to sequester jurors from media coverage and outside influences during the trial, and that the pressure conveyed to them was beyond intense. It was made perfectly clear to them that the nation would be engulfed in flames if they expressed they did in fact have a reasonable doubt over whether Floyd’s death was Chauvin’s fault.

The entire bloody year of 2020, in which unprecedented and murderous riots swept the nation, was premised on the incident that led to this trial. At least 30 people died amid waves of riots that widely used Floyd’s death as the pretext. The Floyd riots have caused the most high-dollar damage in U.S. history, an estimated $2 billion.

The rioters’ violence against police, and elected officials’ willful endorsement of the rioters and failure to back law and order in response, helped cause a historic surge in homicides. As measured across 34 sampled cities, homicides surged 30 percent in 2020, causing an additional 1,200 dead. That’s just in 34 cities.

So, thanks to the anti-police unrest employed in the wake of Floyd’s death, thousands more people are now dead, and a disproportionate number of them are black. The riots’ unchecked anti-police violence metastasized in deadly crime. Anyone who lives in or near a city like these jurors do, especially those in the Twin Cities epicenter, is fully aware of this.

That was all before the verdict. During the Chauvin trial itself, “hundreds” of rioters smashed buildings and assaulted police nearby in the aftermath of another officer-involved shooting. Minneapolis police put up razor wire around their offices in preparation for the verdict announcement. So did police and cities across the nation.

City manager fired for calling for due process, reporters lament 'innocent until proven guilty,' paper runs list of juror's racial composition/backgrounds, congresswoman fuels unrest, & prez says he's praying for the ""right verdict"" as jurors still deliberate. Dangerous stuff. — David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) April 20, 2021

National Guard troops were deployed in Minnesota and D.C. in anticipation of the verdict announcement.

The jurors knew that the media covering the trial and looking at their faces every day for three weeks knows who they are. An in-state newspaper even signaled to the jurors its willingness to expose them to the violent mobs roving Minnesota over the last year by publishing descriptions of the jurors in advance of the verdict. Those descriptions published in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune contained age, race, location, profession, even immigration history.

You think jurors would have been willing to have themselves and their families go into witness protection to venture a reasonable doubt about Chauvin’s potential contribution to Floyd’s death? You think they’d be willing to trade their lives plus nationwide violence for one stranger’s? If you think that, you know nothing about human nature.

Officials from the local mayor all the way up to the president of the United States made it clear in widely reported news the jurors and all their family, friends, and neighbors could read and would have to live with for the rest of their lives that the only verdict they would accept was “guilty.” Democrat politicians openly called for violence if the jury did not decide as street thugs wished, and the Democrat Party — which controls all levels of the national government at present, as well as controlling the state in which these jurors live — backed them up.

“I’m very worried,” Rep. Karen Bass said on CNN’s “State of the Union” about the likelihood of violence across the nation should the jury vote “the wrong way.” “I don’t think anyone in Minneapolis, frankly, anyone in the United States or over a good part of the world would understand any other verdict other than guilty.”

News that jurors, and their families they went home to at night, could read during the trial also told of a severed pig’s head left at the former house of a witness who testified on behalf of Chauvin. The witness’s former house — half a country away from the trial, in northern California — was also doused in blood. And his former employer, a local police department, disavowed him over his testimony.

Everyone, including these jurors, knew exactly what would happen to them at the hands of mobs like this if they expressed a reasonable doubt about whether a man who died while overdosing and with a serious heart condition was actually killed by a police officer kneeling on him after he had struggled with police repeatedly. Reasonable doubts about whether the jury’s decision was justice or politics seem fully justified.

The city government building where jurors heard the case was fortified like a military installation in an occupied country. Every day, they walked into this.

You can’t tell me all of this didn’t affect jurors’ psyche and ultimate decision. They would be superhuman or inhuman if it didn’t. Yet those endorsing mob culture and vigilante “justice” for political ends are working hard to make it impossible to express such reasonable doubts, whether in a column or as a member of a murder jury.

Jurors are always human. There is always room for miscalculation, fear, and error. In this case, however, it is extremely clear that these human weaknesses were deliberately amplified to catastrophic proportions, all because of politics.

A fair trial might indeed have come to the same conclusion for Chauvin. But we’ll never know, and never be able to trust this outcome, because America’s left purposefully made a fair trial impossible, all for political power.

They deliberately perverted justice in favor of violent mob rule to strengthen their political hand. They have done evil and called it justice. They have sown the wind, and the resulting whirlwind has still not fully hit our nation yet. But it will.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/21/theres-no-way-americans-can-trust-the-jurys-chauvin-verdict/,2021-04-21
White House Condemns Columbus Police Shooting Of Teenager With A Knife As Racist,"The White House said, without evidence, that Tuesday’s police shooting of a black teenage girl who charged another black teen with a knife was motivated by racism.

Sixteen-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant was fatally shot by a police officer whose body camera footage, released Tuesday night, revealed Bryant was charging another girl with a deadly weapon.

“She was a child,” the White House wrote in a Wednesday statement on the shooting.

“We know that police violence disproportionately impacts Black and Latino people and communities and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence,” the statement said without evidence.

The White House promoted the progressive narrative that the Columbus officer’s gunfire, which saved another black teenager, was motivated by racist inclinations.

“Her death came as you noted, just as America was hopeful of a step forward after the traumatic and exhausting trial of Derek Chauvin, and the verdict was reached,” the White House wrote in response to a reporter’s inquiry.

The Columbus shooting came moments after jurors in the Minneapolis trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin found the defendant guilty on all counts in the murder of George Floyd. The rush to conflate Floyd’s death with all other police shootings sensationalized in legacy media, however, has erased all nuance in what are often chaotic scenes, such as an officer forced to make a snap decision to save the life of another teen.

Progressives in turn, such as former Obama White House staffer Valerie Jarrett, have escalated the anti-police rhetoric to propose law enforcement ought to refrain from allowing knife fights to happen.

LeBron James Continues To Trash Police Officer Who Saved Teen's Life,"Basketball star LeBron James continued to incite violence against the Columbus, Ohio police officer who became target of leftist fury this week after shooting a 16-year-old black teenager who lunged at another with a knife.

Officer Nicholas Reardon fired his weapon to save a black teen Tuesday afternoon after being called to the chaotic scene for help. Body camera footage released Tuesday night revealed 16-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant charging the young girl with the deadly weapon.

The headline from National Public Radio (NPR) still reads, as of Wednesday evening, “Columbus Police Shoot And Kill Black, Teenage Girl,” as legacy outlets racialize the shooting without nuance to conflate the Minneapolis death of George Floyd with all incidents of police use of force. The White House, without evidence, piled on to the outrage Wednesday to claim the shooting that saved another black teen was motivated by racism.

Just as James bought into the corporate, Democratic narrative the Georgia elections law passed earlier this year recreated Jim Crow, James jumped onto the leftist bandwagon Wednesday to demand “ACCOUNTABILITY” in a since-deleted tweet featuring Reardon’s picture.

“YOU’RE NEXT,” James wrote, the day after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts in Floyd’s murder.

LeBron James deleted this tweet but only after it had 39,000+ likes. The man in the photo saved a young black girl from another young black girl who was going to stab her in the neck. He did his job.

While the tweet was deleted more than an hour after it was published, James posted a follow-up doubling down on his remarks demanding retribution against an officer who saved the life of a black teen.

“I’m so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police,” James wrote. “I took the tweet down because its [sic] being used to create more hate – This isn’t about one officer. it’s about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.”

I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY — LeBron James (@KingJames) April 21, 2021

James’ initial post earned a response from the National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) blasting the comments as “disgraceful” and “reckless.”

“The officer saved a young girl’s life. No amount of gaslighting will change that fact,” the police group wrote.

.@KingJames, with his vast resources & influence, should educate himself and, frankly, has a responsibility to do so, on the facts before weighing in. This is disgraceful & extremely reckless.

James’ remarks also drew ire from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who slammed the comments as an ignorant post motivated by ideological blindness.

“Unfortunately, this is a pattern where the left consistently goes after, attacks, and demonizes police officers,” Cruz said on Fox News Primetime hosted by Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech. “And they do so often before the facts are known, often before there is any evidence of what happened.”

James’ post came as leftist activists complimented their pre-existing demands to “defund police” with insistence on allowing teenagers to stab each other.

Vilifying an officer for saving a black American’s life is a sharp escalation of the calls for anarchy that have emanated from the political left with White House support. James had already established his loyalty to leftist causes, such as the Chinese Communist Party.

As Hong Kong began to fall as a free, independent subsidiary of Beijing in the fall of 2019, James criticized NBA colleagues who tweeted support for the Hong Kong protestors. James said Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey was “misinformed” and “wasn’t educated on the situation at hand” when Morey published a post in solidarity with the freedom demonstrations opposing Beijing’s dystopian crackdown.

'Defund Police' And 'Let Teens Stab Each Other' Is Huge GOP Opportunity,"In November, Democrats expected to expand their House majority by as many as 15 t0 20 seats. Instead, they lost 12, giving House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the slimmest majority of her congressional career. In the autopsy of the Democratic defeat, the party’s leftward embrace of “Defund Police” was in no small part to blame.

“No one should say ‘defund the police’ ever again,” Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger scolded House progressives the day after the election. The Richmond-area congresswoman barely survived the November contest.

Virginia Democrat Sen. Mark Warner agreed the left’s anti-police rhetoric doomed them in congressional races, setting Republicans up to reclaim the House and Senate in 2022, as the president’s party historically fares poorly in his first midterms.

“I think the ability, using terms like ‘defund the police’ have led to Democratic losses in this last year,” Warner said.

House Republicans in a 222-213 minority now only need to flip five seats to take back the lower chamber next year, provided they keep a reliably red district in central Ohio vacated by Rep. Steve Stivers, who announced his resignation for another job earlier this week. In the Senate, Republicans must only flip one seat in an evenly divided chamber ruled by Democrats through a Democrat vice president to cast the tie-breaking votes.

As Democrats prepare to protect their majorities in a historically hostile cycle, the progressives dominating their party appear to be ignoring the lessons of November by escalating their anti-police rhetoric from simply “defund police” to “let teenagers stab each other.” The latter is the outcome of the former, although Democrats only just began to say it out loud.

On Tuesday, leftist fury turned on a police officer in Columbus, Ohio who fatally shot black 16-year-old teenager Ma’Khia Bryant around the same time the jury in Minneapolis handed down a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd.

While leftists sought to capitalize on the Floyd verdict as an indictment of law enforcement nationwide rather than one officer or his department, the Columbus Police Department became the new center of controversy in the anti-police movement. The officer’s body camera footage revealed Tuesday night, however, that Bryant had been charging another black teen with a knife.

All nuance is erased, however, by a political left increasingly enticed by anarchy in an attempt to subject all police to collective guilt, seek collective punishment, and achieve collective transformation. That transformation in reality has little to do with police. Yet police have become a focal point in the culture war. The left has gone from stripping funds from law enforcement to explicit demands to allow teenagers violently stab each other.

Valerie Jarrett, a prominent Democratic strategist and former Obama White House senior adviser, condemned the Columbus police officer Wednesday for defending the life of a young black girl attacked by an angry assailant armed with a deadly weapon.

A Black teenage girl named Ma’Khia Bryant was killed because a police officer immediately decided to shoot her multiple times in order to break up a knife fight. Demand accountability. Fight for justice. #BlackLivesMatter. — Valerie Jarrett (@ValerieJarrett) April 21, 2021

Bree Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, described the confrontation caught on tape as teens being teens, where no police involvement was necessary.

“Teenagers have been having fights including fights involving knives for eons,” Newsome wrote on Twitter. “We do not need police.”

Basketball star LeBron James piled onto the leftist chorus to legalize knife attacks, demanding “ACCOUNTABILITY” in a since-deleted post featuring a picture of the officer who saved a young girl’s life to his nearly 50 million followers. “YOU’RE NEXT,” James wrote of the Columbus officer in the aftermath of Chauvin’s guilty verdict.

These are not minor cherry-picked activists on a fringe online platform. Rather, these are some of the most prominent voices in the leftist movement whose viral posts racked up thousands of likes and retweets to illustrate approval of their ideas from their dedicated followers.

While Twitter is not real life, the platform can often indicate political and cultural currents, particularly among leftists, who have not been purged from the website like conservatives have. The radical messaging even drew support from those in the highest levels of American government at the White House, which claimed, without evidence, Wednesday that the Columbus officer’s shooting was motivated by race.

If Democrats want to escalate an already radical war on police, Republicans will be presented a political goldmine for 2022, and it’s an opportunity the GOP can’t let go to waste.

This article has been updated to clarify Republicans need five seats to reclaim the majority in the House, not nine.

"NBC Deceptively Edits 911 Call, Bodycam Video Of Police Shooting To Hide Teen Wielding Knife","NBC “Nightly News” deceptively edited the 911 call and footage of a fatal police-involved shooting in its Wednesday night segment to conceal that the teenage girl who was shot and killed was charging another girl with a knife.

In the original body camera video released shortly after the shooting, 16-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant is shown running at another girl with the deadly weapon. The officer responding to the scene can be heard calling for everyone to get down several times before he fired off four shots directed at Bryant.

The audio featured on one of NBC’s most popular shows, however, omitted parts of the 911 call featuring frantic cries for help from people who claimed a girl was “trying to stab us.” Instead, NBC chose a quick audio clipping of someone saying, “We need a police officer here now.”

In stark contrast, CBS Evening News showed the important part of the 911 call. ""These grown girls over here trying to fight us, trying to stab us,"" the caller says.

While other corporate media outlets made a point to note the knife in Bryant’s hand, sometimes zooming in and freezing the video where it showed her wielding the weapon, NBC simply glossed over it and merely stated that authorities claimed, “She was threatening others with a knife.”

“Body camera footage shows a knife on the ground,” NBC stated, showing a screenshot of a knife lying in the driveway at the scene.

While ABC and CBS highlighted the knife in the attacker's hand, this is how NBC highlighted it. On the ground. pic.twitter.com/5v9odEuOIj — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) April 22, 2021

NBC’s unwillingness to feature all the evidence follows an evidenceless narrative created by media outlets, activists, and even the White House that this shooting was racially motivated.

“She was a child,” the White House said in a statement. “We know that police violence disproportionately impacts black and Latino people and communities and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence.”

Earlier this week, CBS News cropped body camera footage that showed a 13-year-old boy holding a gun before he was fatally shot by Chicago police in March. The video released this month appears to show Toledo holding a weapon moments before he was shot, but CBS News posted a clip to its website and Twitter page that cropped out parts of the footage that showed the teen’s alleged firearm.

Sen. Johnson Demands Capitol Police Explain False Claim That Officer Sicknick Died Due To Jan. 6 Rioters,"Republican Sen. Ron Johnson sent a letter to the acting chief of U.S. Capitol Police, demanding answers about the law enforcement agency’s Jan. 7 press release that claimed officer Brian Sicknick, whom medical examiners determined died of natural causes, died due to “injuries sustained while on-duty” after “physically engaging with protestors.”



Reports from the Washington, D.C. chief medical examiner released last week definitely stated that Sicknick “suffered two strokes and died of natural causes” after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and that there was “no evidence” that he “suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants” deployed during the chaos. The Capitol Police, however, Johnson noted, did not wait for this conclusion to address the public.

“This finding raises more questions about what USCP knew and what actions USCP took to confirm certain facts regarding Officer Sicknick’s death before it released its January 7 statement,” Johnson wrote. “It remains unclear why the USCP released a statement regarding Officer Sicknick’s cause of death months before the medical examiner made an official determination.”

This discrepancy, Johnson continued, not only spurred on corporate media to run with false narratives that rioters caused Sicknick’s death, such as the New York Times’ patently false fire extinguisher story, but it also played a role in the Democrats’ second impeachment trial for then-President Donald Trump. It wasn’t until late February that USCP bothered to address these false claims

“Absent any official rulings from the medical examiner’s office and following unsupported claims regarding Officer Sicknick’s cause of death, including the USCP’s initial statement, the USCP stated on February 26, 2021, that ‘Officer Sicknick’s family has asked for privacy during this difficult time and that the spreading of misinformation stop regarding the cause of his death,’” Johnson continued.

In light of the media and activists’ severe mistreatment of Sicknick’s death, Johnson asked that acting Chief of Capitol Police Yogananda Pittman give Congress details about Sicknick up to the time of his death and what led USCP to release the false statement. The Wisconsin senator also requested details on what “misinformation” USCP was referring to in the February statement, whether Democrats asked for information about Sicknick before proceeding with Trump’s impeachment, and if USCP made any attempts to correct their amplification of the Times’ false claims about Sicknick’s death by a fire extinguisher.

“The death of any police officer is a tragedy and the use of any officer’s death for political purposes or to create a false narrative is reprehensible and disrespectful to the officer’s family and the officer’s memory,” Johnson said.

Johnson concluded by inquiring how many other agencies, including the FBI, the Office of Professional Responsibility, and possibly the Office of Inspector General, were involved in the investigation. Pittman will have until May 6 to respond.

Staples Won’t Say If It Respects Police Who Protect LA Lakers Arena,"Staples Inc. is refusing to clarify whether it respects and backs the police officers who work at the Staples Center in Los Angeles where LeBron James and the Lakers play.

In response to a question on whether the corporation condemns James’s targeted attempt on Twitter to incite violence against a police officer who saved the life of a black teenager, Staples Spokeswoman Meredith Schwenk was unwilling to comment on whether the company backs the hardworking men and women who secure its arena. She simply told The Federalist, “Staples stands behind our corporate values.”

Like other woke corporations of today, Staples has injected itself into politics. The company espoused support for “Black communities” amid the summer of rioting and looting, but will not say it respects law enforcement.

“The services that the men and women in law enforcement provide in safeguarding venues like the Staples Center are vital for the health, safety, well-being, and economic vitality of our citizens, communities, cities, and nation,” the National Association of Police Organizations said in a statement to The Federalist, a group representing more than 240,000 officers nationwide and a partner of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.

“Individual attendees, entertainers, professional athletes, and corporations like Staples all implicitly depend upon the integrity and effectiveness of law enforcement officers who safeguard the public. Professional athletes, politicians, and corporate leaders know this, and should not be afraid to say so publicly,” they continued.

In November, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested nearly 40 protestors and issued 30 citations for protestors declared unlawful outside Staples Center. Protestors flung bottles at police, in addition to other undisclosed weapons, bricks, flammable liquids, and rocks, while using firearms.

A spokesman for Seven 4 Para, a group that provides combat and defense training for law enforcement and the military in Los Angeles, said, “Staples knows that they need the police around.”

“Just look at what happened after the Lakers’ championship. It’s a going trend now. If you don’t agree with the media, you are probably damning your business. If you support something the media is against, you are damning your business,” the spokesman told The Federalist. “Staples Center knows that if the police were not there, that building would have been destroyed.”

“It gives the appearance that they’re just afraid to actually back officers,” Spokeswoman Julie Haff for the Republican Party of Los Angeles told The Federalist. “We’re already in a heated moment in our society, where police are being attacked, and it’s a tough job. A lot of people out there are not paying attention to the statistics out there. If you do have less policing, you’re going to hurt communities that need it most.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/22/staples-wont-say-if-it-respects-police-who-protect-la-lakers-arena/,2021-04-22
Race-Baiters Have Incited More Violence Than Trump Ever Did,"Adam Toledo is a name that has likely saturated your newsfeed over the past month. He was a 13-year-old Mexican-American boy who was fatally shot by a police officer on Chicago’s West Side not one month ago.

This week, that name was overshadowed by Ma’Khia Bryant, a black teenager who died at the hands of law enforcement in Ohio. In both cases, leftist politicians and Twitter-verified “journalists” couldn’t get the story out fast enough, absent facts, video, or nuance — but the headlines wrote themselves: “Racist Cop Shoots Unarmed Minority.”

Also in both cases, the stories turned out to be completely wrong. On Wednesday we learned that Bryant wasn’t just standing in her driveway unarmed, or just casually holding a knife, or even dueling with another armed kid in a “knife fight” when the officer discharged his weapon. After the officer arrived, she lunged with a knife at another black girl she had pinned against a car, after having already charged a different girl nearby. She was armed and dangerous. And the officer, although accused of being a racist pig by even the White House, instead saved at least one black girl’s life.

Not only did journalists kick off the Toledo narrative with the same racist-cop rhetoric, but when officer body camera footage was released, showing what appeared to be the boy holding a firearm right before the officer shot him, CBS News cropped out that part of the video and failed to note that he was armed in its write-up of the incident. Meanwhile, politicians peddled the line that Toledo was “unarmed.”

These erroneous stories aren’t flukes. Recent history shows repeatedly that corrupt media and politicians aren’t surprised or embarrassed when body cam footage or crucial details emerge that debunk their initial “reporting.”

That’s because they don’t so much report as create. They don’t get clicks and clout by uncovering and reporting what actually happened, but by feeding people and politicians’ pre-existing narratives. That’s why every lede and headline seems to be some variation of Black Lives Matter talking points.

Corrections, if issued at all, are usually stealthy and get buried instantly, and there’s no room for nuance on a protester’s poster board or in a presidential press release. Thus the narrative is set before any details emerge, and narratives are more powerful than facts in ginning up emotional responses and revolutions.

The media know this. The ruling class knows this. If they can convince enough people that America is systemically racist, they can infiltrate government schools with critical race theory — and they have.

If they can make people believe police officers are irredeemably evil, they can nationalize local law enforcement and funnel more money toward their pet social programs. If they can convince corporations that performative “antiracism” is more important than profits, they can blackmail state lawmakers into passing legislation that gives them more power — and they are.

Fanning the Flame

These media and government elites have no problem injecting or ratcheting up racial tension that stretches and stresses countless unwitting Americans to their breaking points. While the ruling class gets whisked away to broadcast from their New York City high rises or to watch and tweet from their secure second homes, outmanned police officers and innocent store owners are forced to defend themselves against agitated Americans whose sole mission becomes to get attention and destroy.

Make no mistake: The ruling class is absolutely inciting violence. The same crowd that insisted President Donald Trump “incited an insurrection” is the one that outrageously lies to demonstrators claiming white cops go on search-and-destroy missions against innocent black Americans. These are the people who gaslight Americans with buzzwords like “peaceful protests” while they watch their cities light up in flames.

The way to bring revolution is to provoke unrest, and the best means to do that is to convince the public that isolated instances of evil represent endemic institutional problems through inflammatory rhetoric and disproportionate attention. It’s a strategy, and it works.

Think back to the many nights of fiery and violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. To this day, the slogan “Hands up, don’t shoot” is a leftist talking point and a protest chant, popularized by media and race-baiters who used the phrase to evoke imagery of a submissive Brown being murdered by a racist officer, all for their political gain.

But it was a lie. The Department of Justice said “hands up” was inconsistent with the evidence, with then-Attorney General Eric Holder calling it a “strong alternative version of events” that “[took] hold so swiftly,” and eyewitnesses said Brown charged at the officer, who then shot in self-defense.

The same happened in the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August. LeBron James called it “police brutality towards my kind,” while other elites claimed contrary to the evidence that the police “shoot first & detain second” and that “he could have been grabbed…he could have been tased….He could have immediately been stopped when he started walking around the car.”

Democratic Gov. Tony Evers opted for escalation, framing the shooting as yet another “Black man or person” “shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.” Joe Biden did the same.

Again, the story was false, yet Kenosha, Wisconsin was already in flames. Nothing about the incident indicated it was racially motivated. Police were responding to a 911 call from Blake’s girlfriend who said he wasn’t allowed on the property and had taken her keys.

In fact, Blake had a warrant out for his arrest from the month prior — information officers knew before arriving on the scene — based on charges of third-degree sexual assault, disorderly conduct connected to domestic abuse, and trespassing. Officers had discharged their Tasers twice at Blake without successfully subduing him before Blake reached into the car, where a weapon was recovered on the floorboards and three children were in the backseat — another fact officers knew because their mother allegedly “kept screaming that.”

Whatever Works

But race baiters don’t just manufacture or capitalize on police brutality. They’ll use whatever they can to get people fired up, including race hoaxes. The Jussie Smollett news cycle dominated the airwaves for days, with now-Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker inflaming the rhetoric by going so far as to call it a “modern-day lynching.”

Remember the “noose” in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace’s garage that turned out to be a normal door pull cord? That was only revealed after the media had blasted the story as evidence of this country’s deep-seated racism, with CNN calling it an “abhorrent, racist act” and peddling the noose narrative unquestioningly under the banner “America in Crisis.”

The media and left-wing politicos do the same with riot porn, glamorizing filth and demonizing law and order. It’s why we’re treated to glowing coverage of a nude protester planting herself in the middle of the street and spreading her legs in gross defiance to Portland police while the same media whitewash crime.

They said, “Destroying property … is not violence.” They said protests don’t need to be peaceful and called riots a “proportionate response.” They denied evidence of anarchy. They said violence works. They condemned the term “riot” as “loaded,” instead calling it “democracy.” They released a documentary claiming “Riots Built America.” And they flat-out pretended cities weren’t being ravaged, with Gov. Jay Inslee saying “That’s news to me!” when asked about the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, and Rep. Jerry Nadler calling Antifa a “myth.”

It isn’t just sins of commission either. The media transgress with omission as well. That’s why you’ll hear Ma’Khia Bryant’s name infinitely more than you’ll hear Mohammad Anwar’s. His life was stolen by two black teens when they violently carjacked him in broad daylight in D.C. last month. One story can be spun to further the narrative that foments riots. One cannot.

The Race-Baiters’ ‘Big Lie’

Back in January, left-wingers in the media, on Twitter, and in the halls of Congress breathlessly reported that Trump had incited in insurrection. He was a seditionist and a fascist, they said, and he posed such a grave threat to public safety that his social media accounts were nuked from orbit, and Democrats immediately drafted articles of impeachment again. When he urged rioters at the Capitol to go home, calling for “NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” a ban on his Twitter prevented the message from going out.

Although the events of that day were awful, the ruling class lied about and amplified them to the point of repeated falsehoods, with The New York Times peddling a false story that rioters bludgeoned a Capitol Police officer to death with a fire extinguisher, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claiming Sen. Ted Cruz tried to have her murdered.

Nevertheless, the left will forever herald Trump as the president who incited violence with his rhetoric about the 2020 election, which they have dubbed the “Big Lie.” However objectionable Trump’s remarks that day, and however criminal the rogues who stormed the U.S. Capitol, this “Big Lie” has no support among the vast majority of the nation’s leaders or institutions, including Republicans like those in Georgia Trump keeps battling, while a far bigger lie does.

The biggest lie is that the entire United States of America — with its white people, police officers, institutions, and norms — is irredeemably racist and evil to its core. The race-baiters who peddle this lie have incited more violence than Trump ever did. When you can convince people racism is rampant, and that silence about it is violence while actual physical vigilante violence is justice, you ignite a flame of division and destruction that can only end with bodies on the ground and cities leveled.

We’ve yet to see the full fallout from the inflammatory and completely untrue racism narrative of the press, although the spin machine’s tactics become more egregious by the day. Just Wednesday night, NBC’s “Nightly News” clipped the 911 call that drew officers to Bryant and deceptively edited police bodycam video to mask the knife Bryant was wielding and instead highlight it lying on the ground later. We’ve watched them do this dance time many times without accountability while so-called racial justice activists take up their Molotov cocktails against innocent civilians.

As Shelby Steele says, “America’s original sin is not slavery. It is simply the use of race as a means to power.” While the ruling classes exploit tragedy to accrue more and more power, Americans become increasingly powerless as pawns in the race war, many paying with their sanity, others with their livelihoods, and even some with their lives.

Black Cop: Media Lies About Police Are Making America More Violent,"Katy Faust interviewed an African-American police officer about the recent murder conviction of former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd. The officer asked to go unnamed in this article to avoid retaliation for his views. The Federalist obtained documentation of his employment as a police officer.

Did you watch the Derek Chauvin trial coverage?

Not really, just bits and pieces. I already had a pretty clear idea of what took place. And much of the new coverage was biased—they were just showing the parts that pushed a narrative. The news elevated my stress level and with all that’s already going on, I don’t need that.

Do you think Chauvin got a fair trial?

No.

Why wasn’t it fair?

It seemed everybody made up their mind about his guilt before the trial. In addition, the jury wasn’t sequestered and so they saw the biased coverage and were likely influenced by that coverage or seeing riots and threats of riots around the country. That’s going to put a lot of pressure on the jury to come to a certain decision.

A jury is supposed to make its determination based on the subject matter and expert witnesses, not go home and watch the news and form their opinions that way. So no, it wasn’t fair.

How would you characterize public opinion towards police today?

I’ve been doing this for 15 years. I’m middle of the road—not an old timer, but not brand new. But even in 15 years, things have changed. There is a general narrative that demonizes law enforcement.

In my opinion, the anti-cop narrative began with the Obama administration. He made negative law enforcement comments, and in controversial cases would show up to the deceased’s funerals (which were later justified as lawful shootings). The Dallas five were killed under Obama and he didn’t show any respect toward them.

Trevor Noah recently said of Derek Chauvin, “We’re not dealing with bad apples, we’re dealing with a rotten tree.” What do you say to that?

It’s funny when the media wants to talk about a rotten tree. The irony there is amazing. Big media talking about a tree being corrupt? Give me a break.

Do you think that policing in America is systemically racist?

Ha. Absolutely not. No.

In your experience has policing become more difficult since George Floyd’s death?

Yes, but we’ve been on this slippery slope since the start of the BLM [Black Lives Matter] movement. That’s where things really started to take a serious turn. We were already nose diving, and Floyd’s death is just more fuel to the fire.

All these cases involve a false narrative of police racism, from Trayvon Martin to Rayshard Brooks to George Floyd, causing tension and a divide between law-enforcement and the community. People want us to solve their problems, but they don’t want us to defend ourselves or the community while doing it.

They want us to be able to talk it out with everybody, but the reality is we can’t always do that. If people shoot us, we’re going to shoot back. That’s what happened with the Breonna Taylor case. Somehow people are upset about that.

And facts don’t matter. Even though the false Michael Brown “hands up don’t shoot” narrative was proven false, I still can’t drive around the city without someone eyeballing me and putting their hands up and saying “don’t shoot” while I drive past.

How has this false narrative about police changed your job? Do your fellow officers worry that as a result they wouldn’t get a fair trial if they’re in a situation that escalates?

Some things have not changed. People have never wanted to be arrested. They didn’t before and they don’t now. So that’s no different.

But what used to concern us was bringing in the suspect safely and prioritizing how we’re going to defend ourselves if need be, and get home to our family. But now it’s, “I don’t wanna go to jail. And if this dude has an underlying medical condition I don’t know about and he decides to fight or he is on drugs or he strokes out on me, a jury might send me to jail for this.” It changes the kinds of calls we respond to.

So we are now at a point where we have to focus only on responding to emergencies. Because most of the things people call us for are not emergencies, they are inconveniences. We used to be more than happy to respond, but the problem is a lot of times, it’s criminals who are causing the inconvenience.

So if, for example, we get a complaint about people speeding down someone’s street, we used to gladly go. But when we do a traffic stop, we don’t know who we are pulling over; they might have a warrant, they might have committed a crime, they might not have a license, it could be a DUI. Now if he decides to escalate because he doesn’t want to go to jail, our badge could be on the line just for a speeding call.

Or we get calls from businesses where a guy has been passed out in their bathroom for three hours after shooting heroin. It’s bad for business so they call us and say, “Hey, we don’t want to confront this guy, can you come do it for us?”

We used to gladly take those calls, but often the addict has warrants and they don’t want to go to jail. If it escalates, sometimes the business turns around and backstabs us. So now we respond if your safety is in question but otherwise, unfortunately, we can’t risk our lives or our careers or jail time over someone’s inconvenience.

How’s morale?

Each agency has its own subculture, but this region’s morale is generally crappy. A lot of officers are leaving. We don’t have anybody, anybody applying to be officers here, so we are lowering standards to get numbers up.

The academy has lowered their physical fitness standards and we have dropped ours completely. Now if you’ve got a pulse and some experience? We will take you. Because that’s how bad we are hurting for bodies. Of course, the lowering of standards does not increase the odds that things are going to be done right. So it will perpetuate the problems.

But even before we had to lower standards, we were still struggling. The public thinks that we are ninjas, that we are all MMA fighters. For a while that belief was helpful because it instilled a bit of healthy fear, of not wanting to mess with us.

But the reality is that most police officers have a YMCA degree (not to knock on the YMCA) but it’s like they went to one little seminar on self-defense and that’s kind of it. The level of training we get is so subpar compared to the demands.

Not only that, but there are important and serious limitations on our interactions with suspects. As an officer, I have a responsibility, we as a police force have a responsibility, to limit the amount of force to get someone into custody. But if they are overcoming my efforts, I can escalate my use of force, within reason, to effectuate that arrest.

The Chauvin case is, in my opinion, simply that: a typical officer struggling to control a large, uncooperative human. His death sucks, it sucks. I wish we were better trained. I wish Chauvin was better trained. Could his death have been avoided? Yeah, I think so.

In our precinct, we pitch and brainstorm ways that we can get better training. Unfortunately, “defund the police” is a movement, so our funding has already been slashed. There’s no money for classes or overtime for us to go.

So they’re basically saying, “We wish you guys were ninjas,” and we’re saying “OK, send us to ninja school.” And they’re like, “No we’re not going to pay for that. We’re just gonna put you in jail when you don’t meet our expectations even though we won’t give you the training you need.”

What would you tell America about this moment in time and your job?

I think that it’s important for people to know that we still have a heart to have people’s backs. There isn’t a cop I know who isn’t willing to lay their life on their line for someone else in a life-or-death situation. But what we’re not willing to do is put ourselves or our careers or our families on the line for people’s inconveniences.

I’m happy to do that as a luxury as long as we have community support. But if we don’t have your support, and you call us about your neighbor’s loud music? No. Go talk to the neighbor yourself. Or buy some ear plugs.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/26/black-cop-lies-about-institutional-racism-are-making-america-more-violent/,2021-04-26
"If Black Lives Matter Gives A Crap About Black Lives, It Will Retract Its Ma’Khia Bryant Statement","Black Lives Matter, as an organization far more interested in deconstructing the nuclear family, expanding transgender dogma, and dismantling institutions than in actually improving black lives, has frequently shown that its semantically strategic name is a misnomer. After the police shooting of Ma’Khia Bryant, the organization released a statement that unmistakably confirmed it: BLM doesn’t actually think all black lives matter — only those who fit its narrative.

“At the exact same time the verdict of Derek Chauvin was being read for murdering George Floyd, police wasted no time in senselessly taking another Black child,” the organization said in reference to the teenager who died in a fatal police shooting last week in Columbus, Ohio. “Ma’Khia Bryant. We say her name.”

The statement continued, asserting as fact that Bryant had called police for help, although investigators are probing and haven’t confirmed who made the 911 call. The claim that it was Bryant came from family members — the same family members who said the 16-year-old knife-wielding girl “promoted peace,” had a “motherly nature,” “didn’t have no knife or nothing in her hand,” and was a “15-year-old girl,” making them less-than-reliable sources.

“Columbus police officer Nicholas Reardon showed up and shot this 16-year-old child point blank within a matter of seconds,” BLM said. “Another Black life stolen with no regard.”

What the Marxist and race-baiting organization failed to note was that between the time “Nicholas Reardon showed up” and when he discharged his firearm, Bryant lunged at two of the other black girls who were present, pinning one of them against a car and cocking her arm back with a knife in her hand ready to strike. It wasn’t “with no regard” that Reardon fired his gun. It was precisely to save another black life.

Of course “Ma’Khia Bryant’s life mattered,” as BLM says, but so does the life of her would-be victim. If Black Lives Matter really cared about black lives, it would recognize that thanks to Officer Reardon’s brave and decisive action, he spared at least one black girl from a brutal stabbing.

Law enforcement acting ethically and responsibly to protect and serve black communities, however, doesn’t exactly gin up enthusiasm for Black Lives Matter’s efforts to defund the police. Stories of cops saving black girls from grisly violence don’t incite the kind of revolutionary violence that turns cities into hellscapes, garnering national attention for so-called racial justice. Honest depictions of white officers saving black lives won’t prompt Americans to click that “donate” button on the BLM website.

The organization did the same thing with Jacob Blake. Did the lives of his black children matter? Why didn’t the organization have anything to say about David Dorn, the black police officer who was murdered during the deadly riots of 2020? Didn’t his life matter more than the TVs looters were trying to steal? BLM claims to advocate for immigrants and other minorities too. Is it going to say anything about Mohammad Anwar, the 66-year-old Pakistani immigrant who was killed in a brutal carjacking in Washington D.C. last month, allegedly by two black teens who were captured on video?

Ma’Khia Bryant was a human being, created in God’s image, with likely much life left to live. But that isn’t why her life mattered to BLM, an organization that makes its millions and perhaps billions by exploiting pain, outright lying about the facts of police shootings, and ignoring the black lives that aren’t quite as lucrative.

“The call for Black lives to matter is a rallying cry for ALL Black lives striving for liberation,” Black Lives Matter announces on its website. But it’s propaganda. The only black lives that matter to BLM are those they can monetize — and the “girl in pink” isn’t one of them.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/26/if-black-lives-matter-gives-a-crap-about-black-lives-it-will-retract-its-makhia-bryant-statement/,2021-04-26
Why The Senate’s Anti-Asian Hate Crime Bill Is Political Theater,"In response to the rise of anti-Asian crimes, the U.S. Senate passed an Anti-Asian Hate Crime bill by a 94 to 1 vote. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, the bill’s lead sponsor, said passing the legislation sent a “solid message of solidarity that the Senate will not be a bystander as anti-Asian violence surges in our country.” Yet a close examination of the bill raises the uncomfortable question of whether the effort will do anything meaningful to prevent anti-Asian hate crimes, as promised.

Essentially, the bill creates a position at the Justice Department to “facilitate the expedited review of hate crimes.” The bill also requires the U.S. attorney general to issue guidance to state and local law-enforcement agencies on how to “establish online reporting of hate crimes or incidents,” collect data, and raise public awareness about hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To its credit, the bill does address some known issues regarding anti-Asian hate crimes, such as historically poor data collection and the tendency among many Asian Americans not to report crimes to law enforcement due to a desire not to cause trouble with the authorities. Better data collection and reporting will give law enforcement a better understanding of the scale of the problem and provide them insights.

Still, data collection and reporting come after crimes have taken place. As Asian Americans currently face an increase in violent crimes, we need a solution now. Especially for the sake of our elders, we need to not have to worry about being pushed, kicked, robbed, or even murdered when walking out of a bank, strolling down the street, or sleeping at home at night. Unfortunately, the Senate bill does nothing to address the safety concerns Asian Americans have.

One of the bill’s most significant drawbacks is to define all recent crimes that target Asian Americans as COVID-19 related hate crimes. Although there is some evidence that verbal harassment and physical assaults against Asian Americans have happened due to COVID-19 fears, COVID-19-related hate doesn’t explain all violent crimes against Asian Americans since last summer.

For example, COVID-19-related hate doesn’t explain the rape and murder of Ee Lee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the robbery and murder of 75-year old Pak Ho in Oakland, California; and the mass shooting in Atlanta, Georgia that took the lives of eight people, including six Asian women. Since last year, the rise of violent crimes against Asian Americans has corresponded to the increase of violent crimes against Americans of all races nationwide.

The FBI crime data for 2020 show murders surged 25 percent — the most significant single-year increase since 1960. The Major Cities Chiefs Association reports that “63 of the 66 largest police jurisdictions saw increases in at least one category of violent crimes in 2020, which include homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.” This worrisome trend continues in 2021, as the number of violent crimes in major cities continues to rise, and a few police chiefs expect it would outpace last year’s numbers for some major cities.

Some leftists reluctantly admitted that America’s high crime rates are mainly due to the lack of policing. Since last summer, activists, leftist media, and leftist politicians have spread anti-police rhetoric and called to “defund police.” Subsequently, budget cuts and personnel reduction of some police departments have created a hostile environment for law enforcement, leaving many police forces demoralized. As a result, policing engagement fell.

Data shows violent crime rises as police retreat. For example, the New York Police Department reportedly made 38 percent fewer arrests from June to December 2020, while the city saw its homicides increased 58 percent during the same period. Chicago saw a similar trend. As Chicago’s police made 53 percent fewer arrests from June 2020 to February 2021, murders rose 65 percent in the city during the same period.

The city of Milwaukee, where Lee was raped and murdered last year, saw a 98 percent increase in murders as the city laid off 120 police officers in 2020. After Portland’s leftist Mayor Ted Wheeler defunded the city’s police department by $12 million and slashed three police units, murders increased 255 percent, and shootings jumped 173 percent.

What will make all Americans, including Asian Americans, who live in major U.S. cities feel safe right now is an increase in preventative police engagement. Yet the Senate bill failed to address this obvious point.

Right after the bill passed, in New York City someone struck 61-year-old Yao Pan Ma and repeatedly stomped on his head. Ma is in critical condition and struggling for his life. This despicable incident shows the Senate bill does little to reduce actual violent crimes presently facing Asian Americans and their neighbors.

Another big flaw of the bill lies in the fact that its sponsor and her Democratic Party colleagues refuse to address the discrimination elite universities have perpetrated against Asian students. No other issue has caused Asian American parents and their children more anxiety than the fear of losing equal access to quality education. Such fear and anxiety are caused by critical race theory’s divisive rhetoric and actions, which Democrats perpetuate instead of opposing.

Due to the relative overall success of Asian Americans, critical race theory treats Asian Americans as “whites by adjacency,” even though there is a wide wealth gap amongst Asian Americans. Critical race theory activists have argued that elite high schools and colleges are not “diverse” enough because Asians are “overrepresented.” In truth, the Asian American population is an incredibly diverse group of people linked to more than 19 different countries containing several dozens of languages.

Yet critical race theory activists have been pushing for lower admission standards and the removal of difficult entrance exams to top high schools. Instead, they seek to rely on race-based admissions in both elite high schools and colleges, all in the name of achieving an equitable outcome for other minority groups.

Many Asian Americans see such an attempt to limit their children’s access to quality education as an unjust exclusion of their children’s participation in the American Dream. That’s why the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York called critical race theory “today’s Chinese Exclusion Act” and “the real hate crime against Asians.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, sought to address this “real hate crime against Asians” by proposing an amendment to the anti-Asian hate crime bill. His amendment called to “prohibit Federal funding for any institution of higher education that discriminates against Asian Americans in recruitment, applicant review, or admissions.” Ultimately, his amendment failed when the Democrat majority in the Senate voted “no.”

It’s such an irony that an anti-Asian hate crime bill fails to address “the real hate crime against Asians.” In reality, the Democratic Party’s selective outrage about crimes against Asian Americans is more about advancing a political agenda rather than addressing the genuine concerns and fears of Asian Americans.

The passing of this Anti-Asian Hate Crime legislation may make senators from both parties feel good about themselves. But for the majority of Asian Americans, this bill amounts to nothing but hot air. We don’t feel any safer, and we are still anxious about our children’s future.

Texas House Passes Measure To Yank Funding From Cities That Defund Police,"The GOP-controlled House in the state of Texas passed a measure Friday to financially punish cities who take steps to join the leftist “defund the police” movement.

HB 1900 passed 90 to 49, defining “defunding local government” by comparing both personnel and resources in a given city’s budget to the prior year.

“Let’s support public safety in this state. Let’s support our police. Let’s back the blue,” said Republican state Rep. Craig Goldman, the author of the bill.

Under the bill, Texas cities that defund their respective police departments would receive a confiscation of sales tax receipts, and funding would go to the Texas Department of Public Safety. However, the bill would only apply to cities with 250,000 or more residents — which accounts for 11 cities in the state. An additional amendment to qualify all cities regardless of size did not make its way in the passage of the bill.

Texas will ALWAYS #BackTheBlue!@GoldmanCraig’s #HB1900 just PASSED in the TX House. This bill cracks down on cities that try to defund police. One step closer to my desk. #txlege pic.twitter.com/CYSrkGVekF — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) May 7, 2021

Austin, the capital of Texas, slashed its police department budget by $20 million over the summer. The city council originally voted to cut $150 million — one-third — of the funding, but the cancellation of overtime expenses and cadet classes protected the remaining amount from being cut. Fox News reported in October that Austin saw a major crime spike, with Austin Police Association President Ken Cassidy noting “[o]ur murder rate’s the highest it’s ever been.”

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has been vocal in his opposition to the “defund the police” movement.

“Austin experiences the highest number of homicides in 20 years. This is why it is absurd that Austin is defunding police. It is also why Texas will act to roll back that defunding and consider taking over policing in some areas of Austin,” Abbott tweeted in November upon new data being released.

Cities across the nation have moved to defund the police. New York, Los Angeles, San Fransisco, Baltimore, and Philadelphia all moved to reallocate law enforcement funding in August, and spiking crime rates have followed.

Abbott’s office worked with Goldman to bring the bill to the House. In August, the governor discussed the measure and said he supported freezing property tax revenues for cities that choose to defund law enforcement. The bill will head to the Senate, where there is a Republican majority of 18 to 13.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/10/texas-house-passes-measure-to-yank-funding-from-cities-that-defund-police/,2021-05-10
Plano Police Do Nothing While Black Lives Matter Illegally Overtakes City Streets,"A video that went viral over the weekend depicts a mob of Black Lives Matter protesters in Texas illegally blocking traffic. Meanwhile, a police officer stood by while a man from one of the gridlocked vehicles asked him to take action.

Last week an angry driver confronted the group of #BLM protesters who shut down the road with impunity in Plano, Texas. https://t.co/kf7PKWvJbk — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) May 8, 2021

The encounter in Plano, Texas, which lies mostly in Collin County, occurred last Sunday when BLM activists protested following the death of black male Marvin Scott in police custody on March 14. While lawful protesting is constitutional and the BLM group received permission for its initial protest, attendees blocked traffic and did not stand in the area police designated as suitable.

In the footage, the man from the held-up vehicle can be seen yelling to police, “You’re the goddamn cop! Get these f-cking people out the way! Get them out of here! They can’t be out here in the middle of the road!” The police officer declined to instruct the activists to disperse or relocate, and the man subsequently confronted the protesters himself.

Around the video’s 30-second mark, one person can be seen pointing an object resembling a handgun at the man. Eventually, the police officer blocked off the altercation, but activists continued to block cars from moving while the officer stood by.

Zach Barrett, president of the Collin County Conservative Republicans, told The Federalist, “If you’re blocking traffic, you’re no longer really protesting to me. You’re causing problems to pursue. It needs to be dealt with accordingly.” Meanwhile, Collin County Judge Chris Hill said the protesters’ activity was “illegal.”

A BLM Activist Pulling A Gun On Bystanders Should Be The Last Straw,"Thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds took to the streets last year in Frisco, Texas — the most suburban of suburbs — to march in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter slogan. Although some people worried the protests would transform into rioting, thankfully, the march remained peaceful. Unfortunately, it also proved to be rather pointless.

Less than a year later, Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets in a neighboring suburb of Plano, Texas to protest the death of Marvin David Scott III, a black man in his mid-20s who recently died in police custody. This time, however, there wasn’t nearly the same level of support from the community. Instead, Plano police were thrust into a tense scene of protesters blocking traffic at a busy intersection.

So, who was Scott? What happened? Nearly two months ago, police took Scott into custody after he was allegedly smoking marijuana behind the outlet mall in Allen, Texas. While detained, officers restrained and pepper-sprayed him, and placed a spit hood over his head. Hours later, he died. According to the medical examiner, the cause of death was a “fatal acute stress response in an individual with previously diagnosed schizophrenia during restraint struggle with law enforcement.”

As with most instances of purported injustice called out by Black Lives Matter activists, the details of Scott’s death provoke several questions. Did he have a criminal record? Did someone report him, or did police merely happen to find him while out on patrol? To what degree did Scott cooperate with the police? Why was he restrained and pepper-sprayed? What do the officers accused of murdering Scott have to say?

Whatever the answers to these questions might be, it should be clear by now that the involvement of Black Lives Matter activists will only exacerbate the problem. After a year of protests and so much media coverage, the official organization Black Lives Matter has mostly succeeded in enriching its highest-ranking members while spreading division and hate in the communities where they organize. The residents of Plano and other communities should take heed and stop enabling them in any way.

Some will object, saying that Black Lives Matter has brought much-needed awareness to the problem of racist law enforcement policies. If it wasn’t for the Black Lives Matter movement, the story goes, most Americans wouldn’t know how so many police departments and other public institutions systematically target and murder poor black Americans, routinely depriving them of justice. Except this isn’t true.

As writers like Heather Mac Donald have repeatedly demonstrated, “This charge of systemic police bias was wrong during the Obama years and remains so today.” While there might be individual instances of racism in law enforcement, it cannot justifiably be classified as “systemic” or even “widespread.”

This is why organizations like Black Lives Matter and its supportive activists and writers have to rely on specific, individual examples of what they can construe as racism instead of real statistics. Even in these cases, the charges of wrongdoing and bigotry are often debatable. Nevertheless, media outlets will do their utmost to present one side and not the other, turning each tragedy into the next political controversy.

True to their Marxist training, the Black Lives Matter organization has effectively applied Vladimir Lenin’s wisdom that “a lie told often enough becomes the truth.” Far from spreading awareness and informing Americans about the criminal justice system, Black Lives Matter’s messaging has done the opposite.

In too many cases, Americans are told to fear police and white supremacists more than actual criminals and terrorists. To make matters worse, contradicting this absurdity will automatically lead to accusations of racism and white privilege.

Black Lives Matter’s activism has brought little in the way of reform and has mostly hurt the communities they purport to defend. Many protests have turned into riots that have precipitated mass looting and arson, resulting in billions of dollars in damages. Additionally, police have been so hamstrung and vilified that they refrain from making arrests, and many police departments now face a shortage of personnel. Consequently, nearly every major American city has seen a surge in crime.

To top it off, Black Lives Matter has collected billions of dollars in donations, little of which has gone to the people or communities in need. From the little that’s known, at least some of their money goes to finance more mansions for founder Patrisse Cullors. As for those neighborhoods and businesses that have been torched by “peaceful protest,” they will have to find another way to pay for repairing the damage.

Fortunately, the protests for Scott have not erupted into an outbreak of mob violence. Yet, a heated confrontation between an angry driver and Black Lives Matter activists — one of whom drew a gun on the driver — should signal to Plano police to stop supporting these demonstrations.

That driver could have easily been shot dead for a grievance that had nothing to do with him or any of the other drivers. It should also be noted that apparently nothing has happened to the activist who threatened to shoot him. Enabling these thug tactics from protesters only emboldens them to become even more disruptive and increases the chance of serious chaos breaking out.

Americans seeking justice for men like Scott should stop depending on corrupt groups like the Black Lives Matter organization. Instead, they should acquaint themselves with the groups that do genuinely good work and with the numerous scholars who give much more accurate accounts of the social ills affecting American cities.

Ultimately, what those who seek answers will find is that much of the ills that plague our society are rooted in culture. This, in turn, suggests the most effective reforms will, likewise, be cultural in nature rather than economic or political.

If we’re to see real, positive change, Americans must stop listening to leftist demagogues and corrupt organizations like Black Lives Matter. Instead, they should focus on giving back to their community, volunteering in local charities, and taking ownership for the well-being of where they call home. It may not be as easy as staging a protest or posting a meme on social media, but it’s much more rewarding.

The Feds Are Trying To Use George Floyd’s Death To End Local Policing,"Last month, when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of second- and third-degree murder, most Americans believed his sentencing would end a year-long national ordeal. Footage of Chauvin restraining George Floyd as he died was widely publicized last summer, with a predictable—and memorable—result.

Although Chauvin was convicted by a jury, that decision was pre-empted by the constant menace of burning cities, gruesome threats of violence, massive corporate marketing campaigns, public statements by members of Congress and the president, and in at least one case, the jurors’ political activism.

Let’s not be naïve. Chauvin’s conviction did not end anything. The monetary and emotional investment that followed Floyd’s death can only signify the beginning of a crusade that will always need new scapegoats for its ongoing show trial.

The antiracism movement’s never-ending quest to remake society, or at least get rich by pretending to do so, is purposefully engineered as a perpetual motion machine. After Chauvin’s conviction, PR firms coached clients to respond with the foreboding catchphrase “more work to be done.”

The first of the “more work” being done is the indictment just announced by a federal grand jury, accusing the other three officers present at Floyd’s arrest of violating his civil rights. Specifically, the grand jury charges the officers as accomplices who brutalized Floyd and denied his Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure. To convict, the Justice Department prosecutor would have to prove that the three officers caused or could have prevented Floyd’s death.

The announcement comes just days after it was revealed by the Minneapolis Star Tribune that federal officers had a secret plan to arrest Chauvin in court for these same civil rights crimes, were he acquitted by the jury. This raises two questions: why indict Chauvin and his fellow officers in spite of the jury’s decision on Chauvin? Further, why would the Justice Department involve itself in a local police matter at all—even convening a grand jury to bring charges?

The trial’s evidence shows that whatever Chauvin and his fellow officers may be, they are not violent racists. Just ask the notorious Democrat operative and Antifa supporter Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, who stated he feels sorry for Chauvin and does not believe he acted out of racial bias.

Yes, the officers failed to adequately diagnose a pre-existing heart condition, compounded by a fentanyl overdose, and applied a restraint that followed Minneapolis Police Department policy. But even if Chauvin and his fellow officers were dirty cops who set out each day to oppress minorities, why not directly investigate them on those grounds? Why should the DOJ convene a grand jury over one cherry-picked instance of alleged excessive force?

This is not blind justice at work, but Attorney General Merrick Garland’s latest sortie in the culture war. The DOJ is abusing civil rights activism to undermine the rule of law, and getting away with it because Americans—even many conservatives—are afraid to speak out.

Libertarians and classical liberals used to defend local jurisdictions against federal overreach, but now line up obediently with the feds’ narrative. The Cato Institute, for example, published a whitepaper in 2004 entitled “A Grand Façade: How the Grand Jury Was Captured by Government,” arguing that grand juries are little more than a rubber stamp for federal prosecutors. So why will Cato not stand up for the civil rights of the Minneapolis officers being railroaded by the DOJ and its grand jury?

Instead, they’ve spent the entire last year helping to prematurely convict Chauvin in the court of public opinion. They want ever-greater powers for DOJ prosecutors to attack local police officers stripped of their last legal defenses. In their haste to comply with corporate media’s narrative about police, the “small government” libertarians at Cato have abandoned their roots to attack local communities at the feds’ behest.

It’s not like this federal power grab over local law enforcement is some new trend. This has been the modus operandi for the DOJ’s civil rights division since the 1960s: vague social justice concerns undermining due process and other constitutional rights.

To accomplish leftists’ utopian goals, federal law enforcement has undergone a dystopian expansion of manpower and authority. Now, along with the military and intelligence agencies’ surveillance of Americans, the FBI, DOJ, and other federal police services devote massive resources to monitoring, prosecuting, and “reforming” local police using tools like consent decrees in service of the latest leftist pursuits.

Sometimes local police are accused of racism; sometimes of gender inequity in hiring; sometimes of misgendering detainees. These are not plaintive tweets by woke journalists, they are official DOJ reports and memos.

This matters because local police are the last obstacle to federal hegemony. This is the unspoken and unsettling agenda behind the leftist mob’s “defund the police” slogan. It is not, as National Review’s Andrew McCarthy believes, simply a misguided replacement of police by gentle, albeit ill-equipped, social workers. It is another step toward federal anarcho-tyranny: the ruthless suppression of politically disfavored activity by federal law enforcement while violent crime is tolerated or endorsed.

Americans have already dealt with anarcho-tyranny in cities like Philadelphia, where COVID restrictions were brutally enforced while the cops pulled back from “peaceful protests” that set the city ablaze. That’s what all of America could look like when local police’s hands are tied and only Washington makes the arrests. The feds don’t do “community-oriented policing.”

Plenty of Americans were disgusted by last year’s riots and especially the weak, politically correct response that left dozens dead, including children. Those same Americans are perturbed that riots and other scare tactics politicized a trial by jury and pushed a conviction despite ambiguous evidence.

But this latest DOJ indictment goes beyond dubious social justice jurisprudence. It’s a bleak reminder that our own federal government is ideologically targeting local police and average citizens more intensely than ever.

McCarthy Leads GOP In Honoring Police After Dems' Defunding Rhetoric,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy gathered with other Republican lawmakers and police officers at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on Thursday morning of National Police Week to recognize the “incredible work our men and women in blue do for us.”

“We all want to show our gratitude for those who protect our communities each and every day, not just during National Police Week, especially when you think about the sacrifice that our law enforcement officers and their loved ones make to the communities to keep us safe,” McCarthy said. “Every year, hundreds of law enforcement officers are killed in the line of duty. Their names are added to the National Police Memorial here in Washington, D.C., as an enduring tribute to the fallen and a place of comfort for those who are left behind.”

This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of the memorial honoring law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty, 394 additional officer names were added to the marble wall. “Pause for one moment and think of that number — 394 more names,” McCarthy said. “Those could be mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, children that are not coming home.”

This has been one of the “deadliest years in history for law enforcement,” said Marcia Ferranto, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, who also made remarks at the wall Thursday. Ferranto added that more than 180 of those deaths were attributed to COVID, as officers “didn’t have the choice to shelter in place, but put their lives on the line to make sure our communities were safe.”

Not only did coronavirus heighten risks for police officers in 2020, but major unrest plagued city streets throughout the country for much of the last year. In response to the death of George Floyd in police custody in May of 2020, for which former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder last month, rioters lashed out, causing billions of dollars in damages and at least 47 fatalities. Up to 95 percent of the 2020 riots were linked to Black Lives Matter, and demonstrators and leftist politicians alike demanded the defunding of police.

“As a former police officer, I know firsthand how dangerous the job is,” said an emotional Rep. Pete Stauber, a former police officer who was shot in the line of duty and is now a Republican member of Congress. “I know what it is like to put on the uniform, kiss your family and kids goodbye, and head to work, uncertain what type of call or situation you will encounter that day. It is a hard job, it is a noble job, and it is an honorable profession.”

Stauber recounted his 23 years with the Duluth, Minnesota Police Department, calling his colleagues there “some of the most compassionate and honorable people I’ve ever had the privilege to meet,” who “became police officers because they love their community, and they want to make a difference.”

“That’s why it absolutely breaks my heart when I hear anti-police rhetoric and calls to defund the police. This kind of rhetoric is demoralizing and dangerous as it puts officers increasingly at risk. This reckless rhetoric cannot be tolerated,” Stauber said. “I will always have your back, and so will my Republican colleagues.”

Republicans recently introduced two pieces of pro-police legislation in the House, including Rep. Don Bacon’s new Back the Blue Act and former Sheriff and now-Rep. John Rutherford’s Protect and Serve Act, which previously passed the House with notable bipartisan support in 2018 with a vote of 382-35. Both bills crack down on perpetrators of violence against police officers with harsher penalties and new federal crimes.

“Now more than ever, Congress must show our gratitude for the service and sacrifice of our fallen heroes,” McCarthy said. “We should not talk about defunding the police. We should talk about providing what they need to protect us. We should not make politics out of security and safety for our communities. We should respect those who risk and give their life.”

“That is why I’m pleased to stand here today with my fellow House Republicans,” McCarthy said. “We know the issue before us, and we are ready and willing to act to support law enforcement, not just today, but every day, and just as we have in the past.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/13/mccarthy-leads-house-gop-in-honoring-fallen-police-after-democrats-spurred-riots-and-defunding-in-2020/,2021-05-13
Nearly 20 Percent Of Seattle Police Force Quits Following Defunding And Black Lives Matter Riots,"After budget cuts and months of Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioting, Seattle’s Police Chief indicated Wednesday that nearly 20 percent of the city’s police officers have left in the past year and a half.

“The support that we had in my generation of policing is no longer there,” veteran Officer Clayton Powell told CBS News, concurring with Interim Police Chief Adrian Diaz’s assessment. More than 260 officers have quit the force since the beginning of last year.

Following the death of George Floyd, protests and riots erupted in Seattle. Amid radicals looting and attacking police, Seattle’s homicide rate spiked to a 26-year high. Nonetheless, the Seattle council attempted to slash the police department’s budget once more, but to no avail. During the particular uptick in crime, the number of deployable officers in the left-wing stronghold was about 1,200. This is the lowest since 1990.

Jason Rantz, a Seattle-based talk show host on KTTH Radio and a frequent guest on Fox News, told The Federalist that “the numbers you’re getting only tell a small part of the picture.”

“You have dozens of officers who are burning their sick and vacation time and will exit the force afterward,” Rantz said. “You have officers who are applying elsewhere and booked to turn in their equipment and uniform, which means they will be gone but haven’t yet been reported as part of the separations yet.”

Diaz was asked by CBS whether the number of officers leaving the force is concerning, to which he said, “It does because we saw our shootings go up. We saw our homicides go up.” Indeed, there was a 61 percent spike in murders in 2020 from a year prior. In a memorandum on Jan. 11, Diaz acknowledged the tremendous spike.

Carmen Best, the former Police Chief, left the force after 28 years in March. She announced her decision in August 2020 as a protest against the $3 million worth of funding that the city slashed. 100 officers were either laid off or could not keep working at the department after the budget cut.

“We will hit close to or exceed 300 separations by the end of this month since the crisis accelerated last year. This is unheard of. Consequently, you have extremely low staffing numbers in this city, at times below minimal staffing numbers,” Rantz told The Federalist.

Philadelphia Rewards Crime With More Votes For Lax District Attorney,"Far-left Democrat incumbent District Attorney Larry Krasner in Philadelphia won the district attorney primary Tuesday evening despite the uptick in violence this past year in his city due to lax law enforcement he’s fomented.

Krasner beat out Carlos Vega, a Democrat supported by law enforcement. Krasner won by 30 points and is thought of as a favorite to win reelection in November in the Democrat stronghold over Republican attorney Charles Peruto Jr. Philadelphia’s Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 fleshed out a lot of money to try and get Krasner out in the primary.

“There is a clear link between Krasner’s election and an uptick in violent crime which has caused certain Philadelphia neighborhoods to descend into shooting galleries reminiscent of the late ’80s as far as crime rates,” Albert Eisenberg, a Philadelphia-based political consultant with knowledge of the Vega campaign, told The Federalist. “Our police chief, a progressive black woman, has said as much — the police are arresting people and confiscating guns in record numbers, yet successful prosecutions of violent crimes and gun charges are plummeting.”

Philadelphia has been marred by a drastic increase in violent crime. Over the past year, there were more than 2,200 shootings, 500 of which ended up being fatal. The National Guard was summoned in October in response to rioting. Back in March, Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney and city officials acknowledged Philadelphia is on pace to have record crime rates.

“It makes me absolutely sick to know that so many Philadelphians have suffered these preventable deaths,” Kenney had said at a press conference. “It’s painfully clear that we must take new approaches.”

Krasner first took office in 2017. He received more than $1.5 million from billionaire leftist George Soros, and his campaign and the Soros Political Action Committee spent close to $2 million. Last summer, Soros dumped money into Black Lives Matter and similar groups aimed at pushing Marxist “racial equity.” The district attorney has sued the police department in Philadelphia 75 times and peddled in “systemic racism” terminology to describe law enforcement.

“In 2020, when Philadelphia was ravished by radical left organizations like Black Lives Matter and criminal opportunists who rioted, looted, and torched police cars, District Attorney Larry Krasner failed to hold the perpetrators accountable,” Montgomery County Republican Commissioner Joe Gale, who is running for governor in the state, told The Federalist previously.

Kenney slashed police budgets last summer as well and got rid of a proposal to provide more funding to police. “We think we can police better and make sure we put the resources in the departments that can affect change and make the situation in our neighborhoods better,” he said at the time. “We want to approach this open-mindedly, but some of these things have to happen.”

Former prosecutors in the city have long been critical of the district attorney. In 2017, 11 individuals who used to work in the district attorney’s office penned a letter referring to Krasner as “a radical candidate with no experience prosecuting crime.”

In 2020, 86 percent of murder victims in the city were black. Krasner prosecuted a mere 49 percent of illegal gun arrests, according to city data. Protect Our Police, a PAC, fought hard to try and get Krasner to lose in the primary. The group made informative videos and took in donations.

“I believe there is a winning coalition to be found in cities among disaffected, mostly working and middle-class people, against policies that are branded as progressive but result in a huge uptick in violent crime,” Eisenberg added.

153 ex-prosecutors signed a letter last month pleading with voters to vote for Vega. The prosecutors said they are “not defined by any political ideology but by a desire to see a better, fairer, safer city, and we hope you agree that it is time for a change.” An estimated 36 of the signees stopped working at the district attorney’s office under Krasner’s leadership, including Vega. Some were terminated by him during his first week.

Ashli Babbitt’s Family Suing Capitol Police For Fatal Jan. 6 Shooting,"Ashli Babbitt’s family is suing the U.S. Capitol Police for more than $10 million for shooting and killing her during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

“Right now, we have no accountability — zero accountability — they give no explanation to justify the shooting and they do not even identify the officer. That is what they do in autocratic countries, not in the United States,” Maryland attorney Terrell N. Roberts III told the Washington Times.

The 35-year-old Air Force veteran was shot with a round from an anonymous officer’s “service pistol” in the Capitol building after she attempted to climb through a broken glass door in the hallway near the Speaker’s Lobby. Babbitt received aid in the Capitol from a Capitol Police emergency response team before she was transported to the Washington Hospital Center where she later died.

The family plans to sue the law enforcement agency under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows for monetary compensation if “a personal injury or death, caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of a Government employee while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.”

The unnamed officer who shot Babbitt but did not receive any charges will also be sued by the family, the Washington Times reported.

“The purpose of the case is to hold the police officer and the Capitol Police accountable for violating Ashli Babbitt’s constitutional right — that is the purpose,” Roberts said, noting that he is “reviewing video of the shooting that was captured by private citizens using their iPhones.”

Roberts also expressed frustration that legislators — including those that voted for the partisan, power-grab Jan. 6 Commission — have not demanded further information or answers from the law enforcement agency.

“If we call ourselves a free people, you would think that Congress would be the first to demand transparency of its own police agency but you don’t hear that,” Roberts explained.

Former Seattle Police Chief: Media Malfeasance Covering 'CHOP' Made Violence Look Peaceful,"Former Seattle police chief Carmen Best said on a podcast this week that the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone during Seattle’s Black Lives Matter uprising was more violent than the media depicted.

Best told Jerry Ratcliffe on his podcast “Reducing Crime” that “destructive behavior” in CHOP was not adequately documented by the media, which resulted in people thinking it was “peaceful.” She continued:

And the other thing that I found very curious during that time frame was that the destructive behavior, for whatever reason, I’m not sure if there’s a political reason or otherwise, did not get the level of publicity or media attention as … I would read stories about the peaceful protests. I go, ‘Well, part of it was peaceful.’ But I was standing 20 feet away from a hail of rocks. I was looking right at them hail down, feet from me.

CHOP, which later became known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), was six blocks long. BLM protestors established the area after the police retreated from its East Precinct. Two people were killed in the area and there were several shootings. Businesses and residents sued the city over the summer for not taking action on the lawless protest ground.

The former chief said there was a great deal of “gaslighting” by the media. National outlets often attempted to conceal the madness inside the autonomous zone. The New York Times defined it as a “homeland for racial justice” in an article with the headline “Free Food, Free Speech, and Free Police.” CNN said conservative media “grossly exaggerated” the violence in Seattle.

In a Seattle Times article titled “Dubbed a ‘lawless state’ by some, the CHAZ or CHOP, Seattle’s newest neighborhood, tries to create its own narrative,” reporter Paul Roberts wrote, “But on this particular afternoon, many of the members of that ‘lawless state’ seemed less focused on defying the establishment than in recreating elements of that establishment in ways that advance the goals of the new community.”

“Indeed, for some conservative commentators and parts of the political establishment, the occupation of this small stretch of Seattle has become the latest symbol of failed progressive politics and the unchecked rise of anarchy and protests,” Roberts said.

In August, Best abruptly resigned after Seattle’s city council decided to cut funding to the police department. Interim Police Chief Adrian Diaz announced last week that nearly 20 percent of Seattle’s police force has left in the past year and a half. The homicide rate increased in the city to a 26-year-high and the number of deployable officers fell to 1,200 — the lowest since 1990.

Jason Rantz, a Seattle-based talk show host on KTTH Radio, told The Federalist that the city’s newspaper and television station “did little more than print propaganda press releases for activists.”

“It was embarrassing. It meant the public was told abject lies about what was happening inside CHOP. A few of us were honest about it and got labeled as liars and propagandists,” he said. “Then two kids were murdered inside CHOP, making it impossible for the media to ignore it. But they still have learned few lessons and so many outlets continue to push fringe activist propaganda because they either believe in it or are too scared to push against it.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/26/former-seattle-police-chief-media-malfeasance-covering-chop-made-violent-activists-look-peaceful/,2021-05-26
Philadelphia Pharmacy Still Standing After BLM Rioters Pillaged It Twice,"PHILADELPHIA, P.A. — A pharmacy in a crime-ridden Philadelphia area was looted upon the death of George Floyd last summer, then once more in October after the death of Walter Wallace.

BLM rioters broke into Nice Pharmacy in West Kensington on May 31. Randal Policare, a pharmacist who is the vice president of a company that oversees the West Kensington store and several others, is no rookie to the menacing culture in Philadelphia. He has been robbed five times in the last 37 years.

“I was on the rooftop with my kids. We were listening to the reports and watching helicopters,” Policare said, discussing the night his store was looted. “We were watching the fires. I was getting calls from customers that have my number. [BLM rioters] were definitely coming in here to get hard drugs. We came in the very next morning and cleaned up. The glass was busted in the front. They destroyed the security gates. Everything was on the floor. The ATM machine was smashed open. The cash register was on the floor. They took computers and destroyed wiring.”

The front of the business was spray-painted “George Floyd.” Policare is still seeking insurance damages for the location, as well as others. The thieves got away with $16,000 worth of narcotics and $7,000 worth of drugs that customers were going to pick up, in addition to everything else.

Policare told me that the company store on 16th Street received funding because it burned down, and says there is a multi-million-dollar insurance claim due to the extensive rioting damage. He cleaned up the day after the riot damage and opened two or three days later. He can’t remember the exact date but says he watched the unrest on the surveillance cameras in the pharmacy.

Riots were a tremendous blow to business after months of coronavirus lockdowns, he said. Customers stopped frequenting the location due to fear of unrest. Counter sales plummeted. He hired a detective to assist in making the insurance claim.

“It was very hard just to get a police report for the insurance company. But I finally had a detective come out,” he said. “As far as getting people arrested, I don’t think they caught anybody. As a matter of fact, a lot of the neighbors stated that the people that did it weren’t even from the neighborhood. They were outsiders.”

The Philadelphia Police Department did not immediately return The Federalist’s request for comment regarding if the looters faced prosecution.

Unrest in the city occurred again in October when the footage went viral of Wallace being shot and killed by police while moving toward officers with a knife. Townhall writer Julio Rosas, who was in attendance for the rioting that followed, noted at the time, “I haven’t seen riots and looting on this scale and this bad since Minneapolis back in May. It’s chaos out here.”

“The second one was well-coordinated,” Policare said about the next wave of looting that took place. “They had mining helmets on, cut the locks, went through the shelves, and knew exactly what they were trying to get. They went for high-priced items.”

The criminals did not discriminate based on product, though. They took garbage bags, Insulin, and even the bags for customers. They arrived in a van and eight individuals unloaded, terrorizing the block.

Policare says looters brought power tools and destroyed a screen in front of a metal bar. Their faces were covered in hoods and they all held knapsacks. While the summer looting was more random and a free-for-all, the businessman says there was a methodical nature to the post-Wallace violence.

Policare is not afraid to call out the looters. He has dealt with violence in Philadelphia since 1984 and does not understand why Democrats seek to defund the police. In his eyes, though, the GOP is doomed in the far-left stronghold. Speaking frankly, he said he sees no way for conservatives to take back the city. He highlighted the fact that there has not been a Republican major since 1952.

“They’re living in a dream world,” Policare said. “It’s just a shame what’s going on. If the henhouse goes unguarded, or whatever the old saying goes, everything goes wild. You need police. And what’s going on — the crime rate in these neighborhoods is no joke. You should see the trash, the trash alone. Like, it just piles up and up, because [police] is not writing tickets. They’re not enforcing laws at all, they just don’t have the manpower.”

Philadelphia has embraced the movement to defund police. While the city initially put forth a $19 million increase for the department, the effort was thrown out during the riots in 2020. The city instead settled on a $727 annual budget for fiscal year 2020-21, a 4.3 percent overall reduction for the police department.

More than a third of the city’s pharmacies were looted in the summer of rage. Minority-owned businesses were hit hard, particularly in the more dangerous parts of West Philadelphia. Two immigrant owners whose stores were looted described their profound difficulties to The Federalist on Tuesday.

“We’re still feeling the effects of this,” Policare said. “Nothing has changed. It’s hanging over our heads and could happen again any day now. Nothing is going to change.”

Yet, the pharmacist will remain strong in the face of evil. “I’m not going to let them win,” he added.

The Left's Insane Call To 'Defund The Police' Led To Murder And Mayhem,"It’s been one year since last summer’s George Floyd demonstrations took over America’s cities, and in these last 12 months, police officers have left those respective cities’ police forces in droves. Some were forced out due to budget cuts while others are voluntarily retiring or moving to neighboring police departments. The city of Seattle has lost more than 260 officers in the last 18 months, nearly 20 percent of the entire force.

Not surprisingly, the exodus of police officers has corresponded with a surge in crime. In 2020, Seattle diverted almost 20 percent from its police budget and saw a 61 percent increase in homicides, the highest number in 26 years.

This correlation is certainly not limited to the Rain City. Major cities across the country, where feckless mayors and extremist city councils have hacked away at police budgets, have experienced increases in violent crime and soaring 911 response times. The far left’s “defund the police” agenda is doing nothing to combat so-called systemic racism and is instead endangering cities, with the most devastating effects among minority communities in inner-city neighborhoods. The White House is blaming guns for the uptick in violence, sidelining Democrats’ responsibility for their anti-police rhetoric and refusal to oppose leftist political violence in the past year.

Seattle’s war on its police force erupted out of nowhere last June. In 2018, the mayor’s office praised the Seattle Police Department as “one of the leading departments in our nation” with “advanced best practices in crisis intervention and tactical de-escalation.” In August that year, the Seattle Council unanimously confirmed Carmen Best as police chief, making her the first black woman in Seattle’s history to serve in the role.

Ahead of the 2019 holiday season, Best and Mayor Jenny Durkan jointly announced a 20 percent increase in winter patrols to “enhance public safety for Seattle residents and visitors.” As recently as February 2020, Durkan lauded Seattle’s Police Department as having “hired the highest percentage of people of color in its history.”

Then within days of Floyd’s death, Durkan and leftist council members were already turning the tables on their own police department. Weeks of riots and clashes with police resulted in the expulsion of the Seattle Police Department from the East Precinct at the direction of Durkan herself, the barricading of a six-block area of the downtown Capitol Hill neighborhood, and the establishment of the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (“CHAZ”, subsequently renamed “CHOP”).

Durkan humiliated herself by insisting that the unlawful occupation was really just a “block party” and that the occupiers were in fact patriots. When President Trump justifiably called on both Gov. Jay Inslee and the mayor to stand up to the anarchists and restore law and order, Durkan ludicrously tweeted that Seattle was “fine” and not to be “so afraid of democracy.”

As Durkan’s “summer of love” unfolded, her warped view of the democratic process entailed multiple shootings, two homicides (both victims were black teenagers), one attempted rape of a deaf woman, and extensive property damage within CHOP. Black Lives Matter thugs spent weeks holding the city hostage to an egregious list of demands by marauding neighborhoods, intimidating residents and public officer holders, and defacing public property. Residents in the police chief’s own neighborhood were targeted by aggressive demonstrators.

Amidst this pressure, and due to the total lack of consultation that preceded police department budget cuts, Best resigned, the first of many police officers to protest the city’s lack of support. Most disturbing is the frustration expressed by Best, and conveyed in the interview with CBS, that city leaders are interfering with the police department’s responsibility to provide for adequate public safety.

In addition to the spike in murders and a 36 percent increase in shooting victims, three-quarters of whom were people of color, 911 response times are revealing a disturbing trend. Average response time for priority 1 and 2 emergencies, including homicides, robberies, and assaults, more than doubled last summer.

Although response times fell somewhat for the remainder of 2020, they have been steadily climbing during the first quarter of 2021. Median response times across all five police precincts for both priority 1 and 2 emergencies remain above those reported in 2019. Residents inconvenienced by break-ins have had to wait even longer.

Outside of Seattle, the call to defund, reimagine, and abolish the police is having a similarly disastrous impact. The data is overwhelming in cities where leftist councils caved to social and political pressure and arbitrarily defunded police departments.

The Minneapolis City Council kicked things off by cutting almost $8 million from the policing budget, an improvement on its original unanimously approved proposal to eliminate the city’s police department. Minneapolis saw a 105 percent increase in shootings, a 70 percent increase in homicides, a 537 percent increase in violent carjackings, and lagging emergency response times in 2020. Within a few months the city decided to cough up $6.4 million to hire more police officers.

New York City slashed a massive $1 billion from its police budget and saw a 97 percent increase in shootings. Portland took a $16 million slice out of its police budget and so far in 2021 has seen the homicide rate soar by a whopping 1,900 percent compared with the same period in 2020. Portlanders have become increasingly frustrated by slow and unreliable responses to 911 calls.

Despite the “anti-racism” rhetoric, defunding the police mostly hurts black and minority Americans in vulnerable, urban neighborhoods, where criminal violence is already the main problem. Black Americans between the ages of ten and 43 die of homicide at 13 times the rate of white Americans. Carving out millions from police budgets means fewer officers, less police presence, longer wait times, and less training.

Not surprisingly then, defunding the police lacks popular support among minorities. A Gallup poll found that 81 percent of black people and 83 percent of Hispanics want to retain or increase local police presence. A Huffington Post survey similarly found that defunding the police has poor public support across all demographics.

Presumably, Americans of all ages, races, and political persuasions are not on board with local law enforcement being outsourced to private security firms, rival gangs, and domestic terror groups, which is inevitably what happens when the government cannot or will not perform the crucial function of safeguarding the safety of its citizens.

Every day people implicitly understand what German sociologist Max Weber was getting at when he identified the state as claiming the “monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force.” If not, the state cannot play its role as enforcer of law and order, which impedes basic public services as well as the regulation of economic activity. The condition that emerges is anarchy.

Certainly, it seems extraordinary that Democrats at all levels of government would persist in undermining law enforcement when these radical and unpopular policies are ruining cities, exacerbating violent crime, facilitating Bolshevik-style terror and destruction, and worsening conditions for blacks and minorities. Whatever their motives, mayors and city councils in places like Seattle that continue their ideological war on police are ruining iconic cities and betraying the residents they were elected to serve and protect.

The Biden-Harris Migration ‘Fix’ Would Throw Good Billions After Bad,"The journey of Central American migrants to the U.S. border — a perilous trip across thousands of miles of mountains and deserts — starts in places like the dry corridor in western Honduras.

Many of the region’s 1 million small farmers still live in adobe huts with no running water and suffer acts of humans and nature. Corrupt Honduran officials have invested too little in stabilizing or modernizing the region, allowing violent gangs to extort families. Recent droughts and hurricanes have created widespread hunger.

“It’s been one crisis after another,” says Conor Walsh, the Honduras representative for Catholic Relief Services in Tegucigalpa, the capital. “Many people have already migrated and others are evaluating whether they can stay on their farms.”

These longstanding problems throughout Central America are driving the current crisis on the southern U.S. border, where more than 170,000 migrants arrived in March in search of jobs and asylum. As the Biden administration grapples with this mounting surge, it’s also proposing a $4 billion long-term plan to attack the root causes of migration — corruption, violence, and poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

The initiative is as ambitious as it is familiar. Presidents as far back as John F. Kennedy have pursued similar aims only to come up short. Joe Biden himself ran the troubled Central America initiative during the Obama administration. It encountered the same obstacles that have stymied past U.S. efforts — governmental leaders and business elites who resist good governance and anti-corruption reforms to protect their own interests, according to a study by the Wilson Center, a policy research group in Washington.

‘You Have to Create a System of Accountability’

Consider Honduras, a showcase of government criminality. President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s election in 2017 was tainted by fraud. He is now under investigation by U.S. prosecutors who have brought a string of cocaine smuggling cases against prominent Hondurans. Members of the National Congress in Tegucigalpa have a habit of embezzlement, thereby robbing citizens of funding for health care, education, and jobs.

Nonetheless, U.S.-funded programs have struggled to make a difference in a nation in which government is a big part of the problem. Catholic Relief Services, for one, has helped boost the corn and bean yields and income of thousands of subsistence farmers in the Honduran dry corridor, offering a glimmer of hope. But a lack of roads, electricity, and credit for farmers means that only a sliver of them benefit from the technical aid. As a result, an unprecedented 47 percent of families in the dry corridor that stretches across Central America are moderately to severely food-deprived, according to an alarming 2017 United Nations study.

Now comes Biden’s crack at the region. He’s tweaking the U.S. aid playbook in hopes of a better outcome. The administration says fighting corruption is now the top priority since nothing will change until elected officials stop stealing and the governments become more accountable to citizens. Countries will have to meet stricter conditions, such as adopting governance reforms, before receiving aid, and officials face the threat of financial sanctions and revoked visas. The proposed $4 billion strategy, the biggest ever for the region, gives the administration some added leverage.

Vice President Kamala Harris heads the strategy team, which includes White House aide Juan Gonzalez and Ricardo Zuniga, the special envoy to the region. Zuniga was born in Honduras and both men worked on Western Hemispheric affairs in the Obama White House. In March, they traveled to the region and had “very frank discussions” with leaders about transparency, good governance, and anti-corruption, said one administration official.

The Treasury Department followed up those talks with sanctions in late April against Felipe Alejos Lorenzana, a Guatemalan Congressman, and Gustavo Adolfo Alejos Cambara, a former official. They reportedly facilitated payments to lawmakers and judges to try to interfere with the appointment of magistrates and protect against corruption prosecutions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“You have to create a system of accountability that goes after the very corrupt elements within these governments,” added Steven Dudley, co-founder of InSight Crime, which investigates organized crime in Latin America. “The people Biden put in place have the experience and ideas, but the bridge between that and actually doing something is long.”

Failures of the Past

The get-tough diplomacy is already hitting resistance. In early April, Zuniga visited El Salvador to press the case against corruption. But President Nayib Bukele, miffed over criticism from a State Department official about his commitment to the rule of law, refused to meet with the envoy.

The snub would be familiar to a long line of presidents who have stumbled in the region. Since 1960 administrations have strategically deployed about $24 billion in foreign aid to Central America and the Caribbean.

During the Cold War years, aid was meant to reduce poverty to build support against leftist movements in El Salvador and its neighbors. It didn’t work. When the decades-long civil wars in the region finally ended in the 1990s, peace did usher in a long stretch of economic growth and declining poverty rates. In the ensuing decade, as drug trafficking and gang violence soared, the George W. Bush administration took its turn in Central America. It sent assistance to combat crime. But the programs lacked coordination and had a limited impact, according to another Wilson Center report.

The Obama administration had bigger ambitions. It expanded on Bush’s security initiative by adding governance and economic programs. The $2.4 billion “strategy for engagement” for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras began in 2014 and included 370 projects to make local officials more accountable, reduce crime and create jobs. In an op-ed supporting the strategy, Vice President Biden praised the nations’ commitment to reform and even met with President Hernandez at the White House in 2015 — an endorsement that proved too bullish.

After five years, the Government Accounting Office was blunt in its assessment of the projects that were mostly run by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Those reviewed by GAO achieved only 40 percent to 70 percent of their own technical targets, such as the number of police officers trained. Officials didn’t even bother to evaluate most of the projects or whether they helped improve governance, security, and economic opportunity.

When the biggest wave of migrants in more than a decade hit the U.S. border in 2019, the Trump administration pulled the plug on the Obama root cause strategy. USAID, now run by Samantha Power, a former envoy to the U.N. under President Obama, didn’t provide a spokesperson to comment for this story despite several requests.

Honduras: Corruption Juggernaut

Biden, who now has a second chance to get it right, faces his biggest test in Honduras. Its economy, which was once dominated by exports of coffee and bananas to the United States, has produced a number of ultra-wealthy clans resistant to the idea of cleaning up corruption.

Miguel Facusse, whose nephew served as president of Honduras, became rich from palm oil production and consumer products. But his legacy is tainted by accusations from human rights investigations that his security forces were involved in deadly clashes with small farmers over their claim to land in the region where his plantations operate.

As the economy became more service-oriented, former Vice President Jaime Rosenthal made a family fortune estimated in 2015 at $690 million from banking, telecommunications, and other businesses. But before his death two years ago, Rosenthal was indicted by U.S. prosecutors for participating in a money-laundering scheme with Honduran drug traffickers.

Honduras emerged as a cocaine transshipment point between South America and the United States a few decades ago. The 2009 coup in Honduras that ousted President Manuel Zelaya opened the door to more trafficking. Zelaya, a Liberal Party politician, had raised the minimum wage by 60 percent and defended the land rights of small farmers. Even more worrisome to business leaders like Facusse was that Zelaya had become cozy with leftist despots in the region and pushed to amend the constitution in an apparent attempt to extend his own presidency.

Zelaya’s ouster by the military led to a period of internal tumult, forcing the National Police to focus on restoring order, often violently cracking down on protesters. By 2015, 90 percent of cocaine coming to the United States passed through Central America, with Honduras as the major hub. More recently Hondurans have developed labs to produce cocaine, extending its tentacles in the economy, according to a report by InSight Crime.

Harnessing the Experience of Nonprofit Groups

Today, President Hernandez tops a list of Honduran politicians, military, and police officers who are under investigation or have been convicted of operating what seems like a state-sponsored drug cartel, according to the U.S. prosecutors. They say in 2013 Hernandez, who was then in Congress and campaigning for the presidency, got access to millions of dollars in cocaine from a murderous trafficker. In return, the politician allegedly told the trafficker, who was convicted in a U.S. court in March, that the military and attorney general would protect his operation. The president has repeatedly denied any involvement in trafficking.

The president’s brother, former congressman Tony Hernandez, was involved in every aspect of the cocaine trade. The end game was political power. He funneled millions of dollars in profits into National Party campaigns for three presidential elections, including the two his brother won in 2013 and 2017, prosecutors say. Tony Hernandez was handed a life prison sentence in March.

The Biden administration points to the silver linings in the dark clouds of the region’s recent history. In the last five years, an effort to root out political corruption made remarkable progress before it was quashed. In 2016, large street demonstrations over the looting of at least $300 million from the public health care system — a small amount of which found its way into Hernandez’s first presidential campaign — forced the president to set up an anti-corruption commission in partnership with the Organization of American States. The United States embraced the move with funding and political support.

The commission’s quasi-independence — it was led by Peruvian prosecutor Ana Maria Calderon Boy and others from outside Honduras — keyed its initial success. The commission set up a new unit of vetted prosecutors within the national government. It went on to reveal an embezzlement scam that later allegedly implicated more than 350 politicians, including President Hernandez, according to the Wilson report. Amid the scandal, he essentially disbanded the commission last year — a decision that brought condemnation from a bipartisan group of U.S. House leaders.

The Biden administration now aims to set up a new anti-corruption group as its main weapon. This time even more independence will be crucial if it’s to work. Zuniga, the special envoy, had discussions with nonprofits in Central America that want to form a U.S.-backed civil society commission. It would draw on the expertise of these groups in exposing corruption and operate outside the reach of national governments to shut it down. But local prosecutors would still have to pursue the cases.

“Instead of creating another commission that the governments can kick out, the United States can support nonprofits that have years of experience doing this work,” says Kurt Ver Beek, co-founder of the Association for a More Just Society in Honduras, who joined the talks with Zuniga. “We will make the corruption cases public and, along with the United States, pressure the governments to bring charges.”

Purging the Police

The U.S.-backed effort to reform the National Police also got off to a promising start five years ago. The police served as a tool for cocaine smugglers, who easily exploited lowly paid officers with payoffs for dirty work. “Officers hijacked cars from citizens, dealt drugs for gangs, and lent out their services as hitmen,” according to a 2016 report by Ver Beek’s ASJ, the Christian nonprofit, which received funding from the State Department.

The revelation in 2016 that top police officials organized the assassination of Honduran’s anti-drug czar finally forced President Hernandez and Congress to set up another commission. Two ASJ leaders joined the group, which moved quickly to purge a remarkable 5,000 tainted and inexperienced beat cops and top officials — including six generals — equaling a third of the entire force.

The purge was a watershed moment showing that Hondurans could topple a fortress of criminality. But four years later drug smugglers are beginning to penetrate the police again, forcing good officers to choose whether to take a bribe or a bullet. “Traffickers tell cops, ‘I’ll kill you if you don’t help me, or take a bunch of money,’” says Ver Beek, a Cornell University-trained sociologist. “So they take the money.”

American agencies funded other projects such as community policing to reduce crime in Honduras, which a decade ago had the highest murder rate in the world. In her congressional confirmation hearing, Power, Biden’s new USAID administrator, pointed to the agency’s record of crime-fighting in the country as a bright spot to build on. “In districts where USAID had programming aimed at curbing violence, there was a drop in homicide rates,” she told senators in March. “That is encouraging.”

However, extortion of businesses by criminal gangs — a major driver of migration — may be getting worse. Gang members approach small businesses, such as barbers, food merchants and taxi drivers, and demand a small monthly payment that keeps going up until the owner can no longer pay it and flees. Hondurans refer to extortion as a “war tax,” which victimizes as many as half of all small businesses, Ver Beek estimates.

Struggling to Create Jobs

While officials pilfer public funds and gangs drive businesses to close, it’s no wonder that half of the Honduran population remains almost locked in poverty. The high rate hasn’t improved much over the last decade and is twice the level of neighboring El Salvador. As the Obama administration learned, foreign aid alone can’t do much to help kids escape this poverty trap.

USAID’s Future Employment program had ambitions in 2016 to train 7,500 at-risk youth in Honduras and place half of them in jobs to lure them away from gangs. The program struggled to find enough recruits in tough neighborhoods and enough employers willing to take a chance and hire them. Then the Trump administration cut off funding for projects across the three countries. By the end of 2019, fewer than 1,000 participants had found some employment, mostly in retail, in the year following training, according to a USAID evaluation.

While they certainly benefited from a job in the short term, their prospects of upward mobility are dim without more support from the Honduran government. For instance, the country has a federal minimum wage law that’s set above the poverty line and could help close the inequality gap. But almost half of employers ignore it and the government does little to enforce it, academic studies show.

“We have not produced the same kind of results that I’ve pointed to when it comes to physical security and crime,” Power said of USAID’s economic programs. “Hopefully we can begin to make a dent.”

Power could start by changing the way her agency runs projects in places like Honduras, nonprofit veterans believe. Aid experts have criticized the agency for hiring U.S. and international contractors to administer most of the program funding. The setup marginalizes local organizations that better understand on-the-ground issues and misses an opportunity to develop local advocates to push for reforms, says Sarah Bermeo, who specializes in foreign aid in Central America at Duke University.

“U.S. contractors are certainly overused compared to their ability to deliver results,” Bermeo says. “There is certainly room to improve outcomes by increasing the involvement of local groups in the design and implementation of AID-financed efforts.”

Meanwhile, migrants from Central America are streaming to the U.S. border. The increase that began a year ago has accelerated under Biden, threatening to top 1 million this year, the highest total in more than a decade. Biden’s root-cause strategy won’t change anything at the border in the short run. Advocates say progress will be incremental at best and measured in decades, not years.

“It’s going to be difficult but not impossible for the administration,” says Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. “The U.S. investment has to occur over decades for there to be a real change.”

Texas Group Launches Petition To Fight Austin's Defund Police Movement,"A bipartisan nonprofit group in Austin, Texas, is in the process of obtaining petition signatures for an ordinance that would push back on the City Council’s vote last year to slash up to $150 million from the police department. It immediately cut $20 million and has continued to reallocate money.

After taking part in the effort to pass Proposition B — a law that reinstated a camping ban downtown and in surrounding areas — Save Austin Now seeks to address the city’s lurch toward lawlessness and disorder. The Council voted unanimously to cut the budget last August amid the Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots that plagued the country.

Since 2015, Austin has witnessed a 124 percent increase in gun-related crimes. As of two months ago, Interim Police Chief Joseph Chacon said the city could be on track for the most homicides ever in a year. “We haven’t seen these types of homicide rates since the 1990s, and if we continue at this rate there is potential that we could have the most murders that we have ever seen in our city,” said Chacon. “That is not a statistic that we want to see happening.”

“Austin has never been less safe than it is today and we must make Austin safer for everyone who lives here,” Save Austin Now’s co-founders Matt Mackowiak and Cleo Petricek told The Federalist in a joint statement. “The unconscionable 11-0 city council vote in September 2020 cut up to one-third of the police budget ($150 million) and it is having disastrous effects on our city. Homicides are on track to double last year’s all-time record. Our current police staffing level is equal to 2008, when Austin was 45% as large as it is today. Attrition is harming readiness and response times. Police morale is at an all-time low. We cannot recruit, retain, or pay overtime. Thankfully, we can fix this. Mayor Steve Adler and the City Council have once again made our city less safe and they refuse to admit it. We will again clean up their mess.”

The proposed ordinance would require a minimum of two police officers per 1,000 population and a 35 percent community response time. Mackowiak estimated that the current police officer rate per capita is somewhere around 1.2 people.

Texas Municipal Police Association is one group that has partnered to back the petition. Kevin Lawrence, the executive director, did not take part in crafting the petition but told The Federalist that “there’s all kinds of tricks cities can pull to manipulate numbers.” When asked if perhaps there should be more officers on duty per 1,000 people than two, Lawrence said, “I don’t know if that is the right number.”

Save Austin Now aims to require another 40 hours of post-cadet class training hours each year after the Council canceled classes and redirected funds to COVID-19 response and family shelters, among other items. Just as the U.S. Armed Forces grants awards to servicemen who display excellence, eligible officers could receive a “Good Conduct Medal.”

In order to boost hiring and incentives, the ordinance would also offer compensation for officers proficient in multiple languages. Another provision seeks to encourage the placement of officers in areas of similar cultural and racial backgrounds.

Mackowiak pushed back on the idea that this would involve racial quotas and claimed several police organizations agree one way to “build trust” in communities during this racially divisive time is to “lower the temperature” and “rebuild the bonds of trust, to ensure that you have as much demographic alignment and diversity alignment in specific neighborhoods as possible.”

Lawrence said the city is aware that the budget-cutting backfired and is quietly trying to adjust its position. “They reversed course, but they didn’t do it publicly,” Lawrence said. “They announced that they were going to trim a third of the police department budget. They started laying off officers, losing officers, and then they figured out real fast it was a bad idea. Plus there were a couple of polls that came out that showed the people didn’t agree with it. They reversed course but they’ve been very quiet about it. They haven’t recovered from it.”

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill on June 1 to penalize cities that enact police budget defunding. The law says any municipality with a population of 250,000 or more that cuts budgets would be banned from increasing property taxes or utility fees, as well as forfeit sales tax funding to the state. A second bill Abbott signed requires counties with 1 million or more people to hold elections prior to defunding police, and counties that do not do so would receive a freeze on property tax revenue.

Save Austin Now’s petition must obtain 20,000 certified signatures by Aug. 3 to get on the November 2021 ballot. Its goal is to break a city record and reach 50,000 signatures.

Other groups that back the petition include SafeHorns, Austin Police Association, Texas Police Association, Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, Austin Retired Police Officers Association, United Hispanic Contractors Association, and Amigos en Azul.

NYC Pride To LGBT Cops: You’re Not Welcome At Our Parade,"Like a bullied kid befriending his tormentor, the NYPD continues to appease Heritage of Pride (NYC Pride). The department thanked all LGBT folks for their “inspiring drive towards equality” — despite NYC Pride recently announcing it would not allow uniformed officers to participate in any events until 2025 at the earliest.

As NYPD thanked Pride NYC for its bravery and courage, Twitter respondents accused officers of brutality against LGBT people and called for police defunding.

NYC Pride issued a statement in May that it will “take steps to keep police officers at least one city block away from event perimeter areas where possible. Although NYC Pride has no legal authority to prohibit officers from performing law enforcement duties, the group is attempting to minimize NYPD’s presence by replacing the department’s officers with private security and community volunteers.

“NYPD will provide first response and security only when absolutely necessary as mandated by city officials,” the group said, citing undefined “excessive force” and “violence against marginalized groups” as a reason for the ban.

Supporters reacted enthusiastically to the May announcement, saying cops “should not be here,” a sentiment that contradicts the Pride movement’s purported pushes for inclusivity.

Along with taking steps to lessen police presence for security, NYC Pride banned any LGBT officers from participating in events while in uniform. The Gay Officers Action League (GOAL), which prides itself on its work to enact “police reform and policy revision touching on the LGBTQIA+ community in New York City,” will not be allowed to attend the parade to show its support. GOAL typically marches in an effort to bridge relations between law enforcement and LGBT folks.

GOAL said it was “disheartened” by the news of the police ban. “Heritage of Pride (NYC Pride) has long been a valued partner of our organization and its abrupt about-face in order to placate some of the activists in our community is shameful,” GOAL said in a statement.

Ravi Satkalmi, a gay police officer, wrote an opinion for the New York Daily News about his disappointment in an organization that had promised acceptance and inclusion. “The move makes absolutely clear that one has to choose between being gay or being in law enforcement, recreating for queer officers the unconscionable conundrum that we have fought decades to banish,” the officer wrote. “For a new gay officer or recruit who is struggling with whether to come out, the message is unmistakable: The LGBTQIA+ community will not support you.”

While the NYPD has criticized NYC Pride for trying to ban it from events and still plans to fulfill its law enforcement duties, the attempted exclusion isn’t stopping the police department from celebrating Pride month.

The NYPD’s “Happy #Pride” tweet raises quite a cultural question: How can Pride be congratulated for its “drive towards equality” despite banning an entire group of people based on what they do for a living?

Corrupt Media Smears IG After He Debunks Their Bogus Trump Narrative,"Members of the corrupt corporate media are smearing the inspector general of the U.S. Department of the Interior after his most recent report debunked their bogus narrative that former President Donald Trump ordered law enforcement to clear protesters so he could pose for a photo during last year’s summer of rage.

News broke this week that an investigation by the inspector general indicated U.S. Park Police did not clear Lafayette Park early last June to accommodate Trump. The report completely shattered the corporate media and Democrats’ prolific but false theory that Trump directed law enforcement officers to forcefully expel peaceful protesters away from the area so he could pose for a photo in front of St. John’s Church.

SUPERCUT: A look back at how cable news went all in on the debunked narrative that President Trump gassed peaceful protesters for a ""photo op."" pic.twitter.com/4pS4aQ8hpc — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 9, 2021

He's using the American military against the American people. He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets. For a photo. For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9Nz — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 2, 2020

Even though the report and Inspector General Mark Greenblatt indicate that “the [U.S. Park Police] cleared the park to allow a contractor to safely install antiscale fencing in response to the destruction of federal property and injury to officers that occurred on May 30 and May 31,” some reporters and anchors couldn’t let go of the lies they held onto for more than a year.

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough used his TV time on Thursday morning to claim that “the headlines from some of our friends and the panting and heavy breathing after this report came out is laughable” and that “the IG himself said this report is not dispositive.”

“If it makes you feel better seizing onto a report that doesn’t cover the entire event and completely ignoring what [Bill Barr] said, you go with that,” Scarborough said. “But that’s awfully thin gruel, if that’s what you’re relying on, awfully thin gruel. Good luck with that.”

CNN’s Jim Acosta took doubting the report one step further and accused Greenblatt of sucking up to Trump.

“As I read the report you wondered if [the IG] was auditioning to become inspector general at Mar-a-Lago. This was almost a whitewash,” he said.

Acosta also continued to push the debunked tear gas narrative by pretending the White House was involved in the Metropolitan Police Department’s decision to use the chemical munition, even though it is a completely different law enforcement agency than Park Police.

“You could hear the Park Police and other federal forces, D.C. police clearing that park — they were violently pummeling protesters, tear-gassing protesters. Remember at the time the White House was telling us, ‘Oh, we didn’t use tear gas.’ The D.C. police were using tear gas,” Acosta said.

As noted by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway last June, the corrupt corporate media “spun a tale of violent, jack-booted cops running rampant through the streets over innocent docile protesters, using tear gas to clear the area.”

“It turns out none of that was true,” she explained. “Every single major media outlet falsely reported that Park Police were unprovoked when they used ‘tear gas’ to clear the area. If any of that were true, it might mark the first time in history that cops without gas masks launched tear gas in an area that the president of the United States easily walked through minutes later.”

New Video Shows Capitol Police Letting Jan. 6 Rioters Inside — And Ron Johnson Demands Answers,"Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is pressuring Capitol law enforcement officials to answer questions about Jan. 6 and why Capitol Police were not prepared to stop people from entering the building.

In a letter to Acting Chief of U.S. Capitol Police Yogananda Pittman, Johnson explained that his team’s review of the video footage from the Capitol riot raised some questions about how law enforcement chose to handle the situation.

First, Johnson explained that more than 300 people appeared to enter the building through the upper west terrace door after it was left ajar by a group exiting the building under the supervision of a Capitol Police officer. Just one minute later, Johnson said the footage shows that the officer, “who was in the vicinity of this door one minute earlier, walked into another hallway away from this door and out of the view of the security camera” while people poured in.

“At 2:35 p.m., five police officers who were not wearing riot gear or carrying any protective equipment, such as shields, arrived at this doorway,” Johnson said, noting that these officers were “blocking people from continuing to enter the building at this location.” “About a minute later, four unauthorized individuals, including two people wearing helmets, pushed past the officers’ line and a surge of people entered the building walking past the officers. These police officers did not appear to take any further action to stop or block people entering the building until a few minutes later.”

Minutes later, the officers formed another line and then engaged in discussion with the group near the door. This conversation was not recorded because the security system did not pick up audio, but Johnson said no one in the group appeared “aggressive or violent.” The officers, however, eventually began to “slowly retreat from the doorway, allowing a surge of people to, once again, enter the building.”

“Security footage then showed an increase of law enforcement officers outside of the building directly in front of this doorway. At 2:47 p.m., law enforcement closed these doors. Over the span of this 14-minute period, it appeared that approximately 309 unauthorized individuals entered the Capitol through the upper west terrace doors. USCP estimated at least 800 unauthorized individuals entered the Capitol on January 6. If that estimate is accurate, it appears this doorway was the entry point for as much as 38 percent of that total,” Johnson wrote.

Not only did Johnson ask if Pittman believes her office’s assessment of the events at those particular doors is correct, but he demanded that Capitol Police answer questions about their actions during the short time period.

“In order to fully understand what happened at the upper west terrace doorway, it is important to hear from the officers that were present at that location. Have these officers filed detailed reports of this incident? Has USCP conducted transcribed interviews with them? If so, I request copies of these reports and transcribed interviews. If not, I respectfully ask for the opportunity to interview these officers,” Johnson said.

He also asked if Capitol police know why the left door to the entrance didn’t appear to be working at first but eventually opened later. “Does USCP know why at approximately 2:26 p.m. an individual could not open the left door at the upper west terrace entrance, but seven minutes later, at 2:33 p.m., another individual could open that same door?” Johnson asked. “Does USCP have any indication that this door was locked at 2:26 p.m. and then unlocked by 2:33 p.m.?”

Lastly, Johnson requested the “security footage of the interior and exterior cameras located near the upper west terrace doors from 2:20 p.m. to 2:50 p.m.” to better assess the situation.

“The American people deserve an accurate and complete understanding of what happened on January 6. To provide that historical record, it is important that all aspects of that day — from the peaceful protests on the Ellipse to the acts of violence in and around the Capitol — are fully and fairly examined,” Johnson explained.

"New Reports Reveal Democrat Mayor, Not Trump, Teargassed Protesters","The first speaker former actress Eva Longoria introduced at the Democratic National Convention in August 2020 was Muriel Bowser, the Democrat mayor of Washington, D.C. Longoria referenced the clearing of a street in front of the White House earlier that summer, an operation the media had repeatedly falsely characterized as the violent removal of peaceful protesters with tear gas for the sole purpose of a photo opportunity for President Donald Trump.

“When peaceful protesters were teargassed across from the White House, our next speaker stood up, stood strong and turned that place into the Black Lives Matter Plaza in their honor. Please welcome Mayor Muriel Bowser,” Longoria said.

Amazingly, new reports confirm it was Bowser — not Trump — who teargassed the protesters a few blocks away from the White House on the evening in question, that the protests had repeatedly devolved into violence and arson, and that the clearing was done for major security concerns and not a photo opportunity. For more than a year, Bowser allowed Trump to take the blame for what her police forces had done.

In her nationally broadcast speech, Bowser inaccurately called the violent riots — marked by widespread looting, arson of historic buildings, arson of White House buildings, and assaults on scores of police officers — safe and peaceful. Then she blamed Trump for her own police force’s teargassing of protesters.

“[W]hile we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting. He stood in front of one of our most treasured houses of worship and held a Bible for a photo op. He sent troops in camouflage into our streets. He sent tear gas into the air and federal helicopters too. I knew if he did this to DC, he would do it to your city or your town, and that’s when I said enough,” she said.

But it was Bowser who “did this to DC,” not Trump.

“We determined, and the [Metropolitan Police Department] confirmed, that the MPD used CS gas on 17th Street on June 1. As discussed above, the MPD was not a part of nor under the control or direction of the USPP’s and the Secret Service’s unified command structure,” the Inspector General said in the report in the section headlined, “The USPP Did Not Use CS Gas on June 1, 2020, But The MPD Did.”

For what it’s worth, the Metropolitan Police Department Bowser oversees claimed it teargassed rioters who had injured cops by throwing an incendiary device at them.

The reports come more than a year after the corporate press, other Democrats, and even some anti-Trump Republicans had filled news cycles with outrage over Trump allegedly teargassing peaceful protesters for a photo op. For example:

The hysterical reaction from anti-Trump forces contributed to a widespread breakdown in law and order throughout the summer, as some government officials feared media pushback to actions that might limit looting, arson, assault, and murder. If protecting the White House from violent mobs was considered unacceptable, what hope did small business owners in mid-size cities have that their lives and property might be protected from destruction?

Other government officials, such as Bowser, demanded there be no federal law enforcement or military presence in their cities.

Bowser, who received accolades and prominent attention for her role in perpetuating the false claim that Trump — not her own police — had teargassed protesters, would continue to play a role in the breakdown of law and order. One day before a mob of Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, Bowser emphasized in a letter to the Department of Justice that she was in control of the situation and did not want assistance from federal law enforcement.

“To be clear, the District of Columbia is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional deployment without immediate notification to, and consultation with, MPD if such plans are underway,” Bowser wrote in a letter to acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, and Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy.

A Senate report on the policing failures on the day of the riot at the U.S. Capitol specifically cited public pushback against military and federal law enforcement’s role in quelling riots in summer 2020. The Army had previously noted the “considerable scrutiny” it had received for flying medical evacuation helicopters near crowds of protesters.

“McCarthy noted that the concern about the perception of troops on American streets was discussed during the summer of 2020 by all key decision makers, including the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Army Chief of Staff, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the General Counsels,” according to the Senate report.

According to an Army report, following the June riot response in D.C., Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and McCarthy “determined that any future requests from civil authorities for [DC National Guard] support during planned protests required thorough scrutiny by both of them to ensure that the use of the National Guard was necessary; and that if so, the mission was narrowly tailored and appropriate for military forces.”

Another issue that led to policing and security delays and failures, according to the Senate report, was a letter orchestrated by former House Conference Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman from Wyoming. She secretly organized the signing by ten former secretaries of defense, including her father, of a letter headlined “All 10 living former defense secretaries: Involving the military in election disputes would cross into dangerous territory.”

“Mr. McCarthy explained that “[the] hyperbole . . . about martial law and [the] 10 Sec Def letter” were “discussed in the entire Pentagon,” according to the Senate report explaining the Pentagon’s response in January. Worries about the public arguments advanced by Bowser and Cheney’s group made quick response to a deteriorating condition more difficult, according to the report.

Former Trump aide Stephen Miller wrote, “Now that the IG report has thoroughly debunked the Lafayette Lie, one must ask: how many riots subsequently spiraled out of control elsewhere because local authorities embraced the Left’s Lafayette narrative—and did not deploy the rapid initial force necessary to assert control?”

It’s a sobering but important question to answer about the dangerous propaganda spewed by the corrupt press and other Democrats after billions of dollars in destruction, dozens of killings, a ripping of the fabric of society, and a general breakdown of law and order.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/14/flashback-dc-mayor-honored-at-dnc-for-riot-response-new-reports-reveal-she-not-trump-teargassed-protesters/,2021-06-14
"To Prompt Less Policing, Black Communities Need More Married Fathers","Father’s Day is a time to appreciate the role fathers play in training the next generation, and then-presidential candidate Barack Obama used his national platform to do so in a memorable speech 13 years ago.

“Of all the rocks upon which we build our lives, we are reminded today that family is the most important,” Obama said. “And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation.”

In the speech, Obama also addressed poverty, crime, incarceration, and poor educational achievement in the black community — and looked to the home for both the root cause of those issues as well as the solution.

He presented statistics that children who grow up without a father are “five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of school, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.” Obama challenged black men to live up to the responsibilities of fatherhood and demonstrate examples of excellence and hard work within an intact family unit.

But just a few years after Obama’s speech, the predominant narrative is that pushed by the proudly Marxist Black Lives Matter organization with its shameless antipathy towards the traditional family and especially fathers.

“We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement,” a now-removed page on the Black Lives Matter website said, “by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.” It’s painfully obvious that any mention of fathers is missing.

The family unit — father included — is the basic building block of society, providing the primary method for teaching children moral values, self-control, and responsible adult behavior. It’s also the long-term solution to preventing crime far more effectively than BLM’s plan to abolish the police.

To solve the crises of crime, incarceration, poverty, and education, we must rebuild the “rock of the family” with strong fathers, as Obama called for. America needs a rebirth of family values and responsible fatherhood.

But instead, Black Lives Matter minimizes black fathers. Rather than look to families for social change, BLM calls for the murder of police officers, justifies looting as slavery reparations, and is linked with most of the more than 600 riots that caused an estimated $2 billion in property damage last year. Its goals and those of its affiliate organizations include abolishing the police and prisons, ending capitalism, and disrupting the Western nuclear family.

The destructive influence of Black Lives Matter has made things worse, not better. Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities implementing BLM’s “defund the police” agenda and where police departments have retreated before rioting mobs. In 2020, the number of black homicide victims increased by more than 1,100.

The real violence epidemic in black communities is not systemic police racism — as BLM would have you believe — but crime. In 2018, police shot and killed 996 people, of whom 209 were black. The same year, there were 14,123 murders in the United States. Over half, or 7,407, of those were black victims. Of single-victim, single-offender situations, at least 89 percent of black victims were killed by black assailants.

In 2020, 15 unarmed people killed by police were black and 21 were white. Those 15 deaths of unarmed black people by police equal only 0.17 percent of the estimated 8,600 deaths of black people by homicide in the same year. Police actually prevent the deaths of black Americans — the reason 81 percent of black Americans want the same number or more police in their communities.

Black Americans, particularly young men, commit violent crime at a rate much higher than their proportion of the population. The black population of the United States is 13 percent, but black offenders committed 52 percent of all homicides between 1980 and 2008.

Obama identified the right source, of both the problem and the solution. Black communities not only have some of the highest rates of violent crime, they also have the highest rate of children born to unmarried mothers — 69 percent overall, and higher in many inner-city neighborhoods.

The crisis of fatherless families is not unique to the black community. The out-of-wedlock birth rate is 52 percent among Hispanic Americans. At 28 percent, the illegitimacy rate among white Americans is higher than what Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed among black families in 1965 when he predicted catastrophic social consequences.

As Obama noted, the effects of fatherlessness on children is devastating. Eighty-five percent of youth inmates, 71 percent of all high school dropouts, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children did not have a father at home. If we truly believe black lives matter, we must separate myth from reality and speak the truth about why so many are being lost.

Portland's 'Protest Response Unit' Police Officers Resign En Masse,"After one of their own colleagues was indicted, approximately 50 Portland police officers, sergeants, and detectives resigned en masse from the Portland Police Bureau’s protest response unit on Wednesday. This resignation is unprecedented.

The Oregonian notes that police feel abandoned by City Hall and the district attorney, after dealing with over 100 consecutive nights of protest coverage. The indictment of one of their own team members was the final straw.

The unit, which existed to “provide public safety at crowd events when there was a threat of harm to the community,” consisted of approximately 50 voluntary employees, who served on the unit “in addition to their regular duties.”

After a tenuous year confronting violent rioters and extreme, unprecedented circumstances, members of the now-disbanded protest response unit simply refuse to volunteer any longer. They still serve on duty and complete regular assignments, but the protest response unit no longer exists.

In October, Former President of the Police Union, and Presiding Executive Director, Daryl Turner emphasized that “members [of the protest response unit] do not volunteer to have Molotov cocktails, fireworks, explosives, rocks, bottles, urine, feces and other dangerous objects thrown at them.” He added that members of the unit volunteer without receiving any specialty pay. They do it to protect their communities.

Turner continued: “Nor do they volunteer to have threats of rape, murder, and assaults on their families hurled at them. They do not volunteer to suffer serious injuries, to be subjected to warrantless criticism and face allegations by elected officials, or to suffer through baseless complaints and lengthy investigations devoid of due process.” He lamented that “These officers find themselves in a no-win situation.”

The resignations, and ensuing unit dismantlement, follow the indictment of Portland police officer Corey Budworth, who served on the unit. Budworth was charged “in connection with an alleged assault during a confrontation with protestors demonstrating against George Floyd’s murder last year.” He “allegedly [struck] a woman in the head” with a baton.

The police union has criticized the prosecution as politically motivated, arguing that Budworth’s baton strike was an accident, not a criminal act.

The Oregonian also notes that “[t]he Portland Police Association issued a statement earlier this week, saying [the district attorney] needs to prosecute ‘the real criminals who are perpetrating vandalism, arson, gun violence, and other violent crimes in [the] community,’ and not go after officers attempting to do their jobs with little support.”

Meanwhile, Democrat Mayor Ted Wheeler conceded that the past year has been difficult for officers: “I want to acknowledge the toll this past year has taken on them and their families — they have worked long hours under difficult conditions. I personally heard from some of them today, and I appreciate their willingness to share their concerns about managing the many public gatherings that often were violent and destructive.”

Yet, Wheeler’s comments are insufficient in convincing officers to resume their former duties on Portland’s disbanded protest unit. And Portland continues to be an epicenter of violence.

In March, over 50 rioters burned and vandalized Portland’s Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse. In December, Portland’s (shortly-lived) Antifa autonomous zone sported messages calling for the murder of police officers. Portland also burned following the November presidential election. And all of this follows a summer of violent anarchy.

Meanwhile, just last month, a march on the anniversary of George Floyd’s death became violent and five individuals were arrested. The Portland police department faces “an exodus” of demoralized officers.

Obama Policing Task Force Member Blames Cops For Democrat-Induced Crime Surges,"MSNBC contributor Brittany Packnett Cunningham, who was appointed in 2015 to serve on President Barack Obama’s “Task Force on 21st Century Policing” and is a major defund-the-police activist, claimed on-air that the crime surge is “the fault of the police.”

“Defunding the police is not just about taking money out of an institution that continues to prove ineffective,” Cunningham said. “It’s also about refunding the people.”

“The police haven’t been defunded,” Cunningham continued. “You actually look at the 50 largest cities, law enforcement spending as a share of the general expenditure in each of those cities actually rose slightly from 13.6 percent to 13.7 percent, and many of the cities that have talked about removing that money, like Minneapolis and Seattle, they’ve actually paused or slowed how they were thinking about moving that money. … So this rising crime is not the fault of the movement, it’s actually the fault of the police.”

Cunningham’s claim that law enforcement has not been defunded is false. Dozens of cities moved to slash budgets after the death of George Floyd last year, leading to lawlessness and disorder. Minneapolis, for instance, cut $8 million from its budget in December, and New York voted in August to pull $1 billion from its budget.

In fact, the 50 largest cities in America slashed budgets by more than 5 percent this year. While it is true that many cities have reversed course, such as Seattle and New York, damage had already been done as anti-police rhetoric dominated Democrat talking points, with left-wing leaders, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, even condoning lawlessness. Preliminary 2020 FBI data indicates homicides increased by 25 percent. In Chicago, homicides increased by 56 percent and in Atlanta by 58 percent.

As the Wall Street Journal noted in a May report, after the rise in crime, “In the nation’s 20 largest local law-enforcement agencies, city and county leaders want funding increases for nine of the 12 departments where next year’s budgets already have been proposed. The increases range from 1% to nearly 6%.”

“In Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed, the city cut $8 million from the department last year, only to restore $6.4 million to hire new officers amid mass retirements and rising crime,” the report also stated.

Cunningham has been a major advocate for defunding police. She claimed on MSNBC a few weeks ago that cutting budgets is “giving us the opportunity to reenvision and reimagine what public safety looks like in our communities.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/22/obama-policing-task-force-member-blames-cops-for-democrat-induced-crime-surges/,2021-06-22
Colorado Police Officer Killed 'Because He Was Wearing A Uniform And A Badge',"On Monday, Colorado police officer Gordon Beesley was ambushed and shot by 59-year old Ronald Troyke, who had “expressed hatred of police officers,” according to Arvada Police Department Chief Link Strate. Forty-year-old John Hurley, who confronted the gunman, was also fatally shot.

According to the department, police were notified of a disturbance near Arvada Library in Olde Town Square around 1:15 p.m. on Monday. About 15 minutes after Beesley responded to the call, the department received reports that multiple shots had been fired and an officer was hit. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene.

While not much is known about the confirmed gunman, Strate said the shooting was fueled by disdain for police officers.

“I can tell you that Gordon was targeted because he was wearing an Arvada police uniform and a badge,” he said.

“Communities need to understand and know what they ask of their police officers — the sacrifices they make, the cost to them to protect your safety. This was a deliberate act of violence,” Strate said.

Strate identified the second victim John Hurley as a “good Samaritan” who “likely disrupted what could have been a larger loss of life.”

Hurley was shopping at the Arvada Army Navy Surplus store where eyewitness Bill Troyanos works, Denver7 reported. Troyanos said when gunshots rang from outside, Hurley pulled his concealed carry-on gun from its holster and ran toward them.

“He did not hesitate; he didn’t stand there and think about it. He totally heard the gunfire, went to the door, saw the shooter, and immediately ran in that direction,” Troyanos said. “I just want to make sure his family knows how heroic he was.”

According to more eyewitness reports, Hurley urged bystanders to safety. Although police have not released information on who shot Hurley or the gunman, Troyanos said he witnessed Hurley confront and shoot the gunman.

According to Hurley’s friend Brian Romero, who organized a GoFundMe for the Hurley family, Hurley is survived by his loving parents and sister.

“[John’s] story is not making national news as the officer involved was a 19 year veteran and beloved community member,” Romero wrote. “Johnny was also a victim of senseless violence all too prevalent in today’s society.”

The APD is conducting an ongoing criminal investigation to monitor the case, but authorities said the shooting appears to be an isolated incident.

“My thoughts are with the family and friends of the officer who was tragically killed in the line of duty while swiftly and bravely responding to protect civilians in the area,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

Dem Mayor Tells Portland Police To Stop Doing Their Job Because 'Equity',"Democrat Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced on Tuesday that law enforcement will not be doing much enforcing at all.

Police officers in Portland have been told to stand down when it comes to low-level classified traffic infractions, which include broken headlights and expired plates, unless officers have determined a threat. When an officer pulls over a civilian, the policeman is now required to capture a video of consent prior to searching the vehicle, and the person may refuse.

“I know we have a lot more work to do, but these changes constitute significant progress in our work to reimagine our public safety system for the better and to continue operationalizing our city core values of anti-racism, communication, collaboration, equity, transparency, and fiscal responsibility,” Wheeler said. “The goal of these two changes is to make our safety safer and more equitable.”

Portland Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell participated in the conference with Wheeler, which took place over video. Lovell said the department is operating on “limited resources and we’re trying to direct those resources most appropriately,” a result of failed Democrat policies that have led to shorthanded precincts and unfettered crime.

Portland emerged as one of the first cities nationwide to defund the police, slashing the budget by $16 million in June 2020. Riots ravaged Portland for 100 days straight, as Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets.

“But given the resources that we have and the limited time officers have to do this type of enforcement, I’m directing our sworn personnel to focus on safety violations and enforcement and high crash corridors,” Wheeler said. “Stops of nonmoving violations or lower-level infractions are still allowed, but with an emphasis on safety and have actionable investigative factor to them.”

Dru Draper, communications director for the Oregon Senate GOP, told The Federalist Wheeler is going against basic data. He also indicated Democrats in the legislature are gearing up to pass a budget that only bolsters the number of Oregon State Police Troopers by 28 officers.

“These traffic stops often lead to stopping larger crimes,” Draper said. “Over the weekend, Oregon State Police made a traffic stop and found nearly 60 pounds of methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl — which are poisoning our communities. Democrats will stop at nothing to dismantle the police and render them completely ineffective at keeping Oregonians safe. They deserve better.”

Since July 1, 2020, at least 130 officers have ceased to work at the department, 75 of which resigned, according to The Oregonian. While the department can employ a total of 916 officers, it now has only 812. Lovell said last week that “it’s tough to move forward when you’re really dealing with a lot of setbacks,” though he seems to have given into Wheeler’s politically motivated move to target police.

“This insane assault on cops’ ability to do their jobs has got to stop,” Nate Hochman, a Publius Fellow at the Claremont Institute and a Portland native told The Federalist. “The Portland riots, the breakdown of order, the burgeoning homelessness crisis, and the refusal from city leaders like Ted Wheeler to enforce basic laws in the city has done serious, lasting damage to the community.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/23/oregon-democrat-mayor-instructs-portland-police-to-stop-doing-their-job-because-equity/,2021-06-23
"White House Says Republicans, Not Democrats, Tried To Defund Police","Unfortunately for White House staff, the rest of the country isn’t as amnesic as their bossman Joe Biden, which is why when press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday tried to pretend it was actually Republicans, not Democrats, who attempted to defund the police, it was easy to call hogwash.

The pants-on-fire moment came in response to a question from Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy, who asked about Biden’s new “comprehensive strategy to combat violent crime and gun violence” that includes a “whole-of-government approach” to hamper the flow of firearms, provide federal support for local law enforcement, and expand summer programming and job opportunities for young people.

Is the idea that criminals are going to stop committing crimes if they have a summer job? Doocy wanted to know.

Psaki’s response gets a handful of Pinocchios:

Part of [Biden’s] announcement is also ensuring there’s specific guidance to communities across the countries to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American Jobs Plan that was voted into law by Democrats just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police — I’ll let others say that, but that’s a piece.

The press secretary’s wink and nod with her “some might say” language was a clever attempt to put distance between herself and her own claims, but Psaki’s suggestion was clear: Republicans were “for defunding the police.”

In case anybody is having a Bidenesque brain fart and has lost track of which party was actually calling for police defunding, remember that while then-President Donald Trump was tweeting “LAW & ORDER,” Democrats were decrying the deployment of law enforcement officers to combat the left’s summer of rage.

While conservatives were calling for funding and defending understaffed and overwhelmed police departments, “defund the police” became a majority position among Democrats, with polling revealing 55 percent supporting defunding (not to be confused with diverting resources; that was a separate poll question).

Even Democrats acknowledged their errors, with Biden saying in a leaked December call with civil rights leaders that his party’s “defund the police” rhetoric was how Republicans “beat the living hell out of us across the country.”

“[If] we are going to run on Medicare for All, defund the police, socialized medicine, we’re not going to win,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, said on a different call in November, with Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia adding that if their party couldn’t reevaluate the platforms they relied on for the 2020 election, they would lose in a landslide in the 2022 midterms.

“No one should say ‘defund the police’ ever again,” Spanberger said. “Nobody should be talking about socialism.”

These panicked PR campaigns by Democrats were a direct result of their radicalizing party falling out of favor with Americans who were boarding up their windows as Democratic leaders insisted “Policing in our country is inherently & intentionally racist,” “no more policing,” and that defunded police “looks like a suburb.”

‘Defunding The Police’ Is Ridiculous. Here’s How To Do Real Police Reform,"By the time I heard a local activist leader shout that he had brought a group of protesters outside my house to make my children, wife, and neighbors “uncomfortable,” I had mostly given up on the idea that meaningful systemic changes would come out of the movement sparked by the brutal murder of George Floyd.

I am an African American man who grew up in rough neighborhoods in Dallas during the most violent period of our nation’s history. Before I became mayor, I had successfully pushed for police accountability measures and expanded educational opportunities during my nine years in the Texas legislature. I was raising two black boys in America (and have added a daughter since then). I was horrified by the death of George Floyd. And Eric Garner. And Philando Castile. And Tamir Rice. And Michael Brown. And on and on.

But like many of my fellow mayors across the country, I had become the enemy because I didn’t believe in slashing the budget of our police department — which had already shrunk by hundreds of officers during the previous five years — amid staggering increases in violent crime in Dallas.

The movement, which began with bipartisan support and captured hearts and minds across the country in a way I had never before seen, was hijacked by elitist and extremist talk of “defunding” or “dismantling.” The loudest voices eschewed common ground and common sense, opting for sloganeering and an air of insatiability that repelled rather than persuaded. Many positive changes, including better use-of-force policies, came out of the movement, but many other opportunities have been squandered.

It didn’t have to be that way. And it still doesn’t.

Cities and states can implement programs now that provide for equity, improve policing, and make us less reliant on law enforcement to solve every social ill. And the federal government could support these ideas through a 21st-century crime bill. Whereas the 1994 Crime Bill centered on punishment, a new plan could focus on prevention and policing.

Now is the time to take action in a comprehensive way. Violent crime is up across the country, and underserved communities and minorities are disproportionately the victims. They deserve safety and justice. During the pandemic, I was a member of the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice, and we collected data that showed aggravated assault rates in the United States increased 7 percent, gun assault rates went up by 22 percent, and homicides spiked by 24 percent. In Dallas, the numbers were even higher.

Police can help stop violent crime and bring criminals to justice. Over and over, defunding activists claimed that police only show up after a crime is committed — an absurd notion that suggests all crimes are just one-offs and that there is no such thing as repeat offenders and no need for detectives.

There are bad people in this world. Maybe some people could have been saved and still can be once they are in the criminal justice system. But once they victimize someone, they must be stopped. That’s why we need police, and why defunding — whatever it means — is a mistake. We also need solutions that reduce our dependence on law enforcement and prevent crimes from occurring in the first place.

Here is how we can fight crime and make our police departments better and more responsive.

Demand and develop crime reduction plans. Every city’s police chief should have an annual strategic plan to reduce violent crime and to engage the community. This may seem simple, but when I became mayor in June 2019, it became apparent that the police brass of the ninth-largest city in the country simply didn’t have a comprehensive crime-reduction plan. I had to demand one.

That also meant that policymakers had nothing on which they could base resource allocation decisions and had no real way to assess accountability or let their constituents know what steps were being taken or why. Accountability must start at the top.

Offer competitive pay for police. Simply put, you get what you pay for. Policing poses many potential dangers for both suspects and the police, and the pay isn’t always commensurate with the risks and skills required to do the job.

In 2019, we supported market-based pay increases in Dallas after years of losing some of our best young officers, whom we paid to train, to growing suburban cities with salaries that were $10,000-$15,000 a year more than what we offered. If we want good community policing, we must set high standards and pay accordingly.

Improve accountability measures. Those who can’t meet those expectations need to find other work. The stakes are too high. A civilian police oversight board can be an important way to hold our police officers accountable.

We have enhanced ours in Dallas and hired a monitor to help review cases and recommend policy changes in line with evolving community expectations. We also need to double down on body cameras, which have allowed prosecutors, grand juries, juries, and the public to cut through the noise and see issues more clearly.

Expand training for police officers. Those cameras also give police something that has been used for decades in sports: game film. Video is an important training tool. And training must be intensive.

Police are expected to think like lawyers, criminologists, psychologists, and athletes. No police department worth its salt should be adhering to only the minimum prescribed state standards as they exist now. Boost the requirements, give the best available training, and correct mistakes.

Address environmental factors that cause crime. In August 2019, I formed the Mayor’s Task Force on Safe Communities to make recommendations for policies that could reduce crime without the involvement of law enforcement. After reviewing policies in some other cities, the Task Force recommended improving lighting and remediating blight in high-crime areas.

Crime tends to exist where criminals believe no one is watching and that no one cares. We need to eliminate havens for violence. We have begun implementing these recommendations through our newly formed Office of Integrated Public Safety Solutions, and the early returns have been promising. Cities should move swiftly on place-based crime reduction strategies that don’t involve law enforcement.

Provide counseling services, early and often. My Task Force on Safe Communities also recommended two policies aimed at changing behaviors: implementing social and emotional learning (SEL) curriculum in schools and employing violence interrupters in targeted neighborhoods. Both programs are meant to help people learn to deal with conflict in nonviolent ways.

We recently hired Youth Advocate Programs to run a violence interrupter program, and other cities have started similar programs. And Dallas ISD has expanded its SEL program, which has produced positive results.

Handle mental health calls the right way. Police are not equipped well enough to deal with mental health emergencies. In Dallas, we have created and expanded our RIGHT (Rapid Integrated Group Healthcare Team) Care program, which deploys mental health professionals to calls, accompanied by police. Other cities have similar programs. They are worth the cost and help cities deal with their most vulnerable residents in a caring and understanding way.

Create and expand summer jobs programs. These programs are primarily meant to give young people some money and teach them life and job skills. But they also help reduce crime. One federally funded 2017 study showed that New York City’s Summer Youth Employment program participants were 17 percent less likely to be arrested during the summer and 23 percent less likely to be arrested for a felony. In Dallas, we are scaling up my summer jobs program for youth called Dallas Works and hope to see similar results.

These are real solutions that do not require defunding or dismantling anything. They are about building for a better future.

They also reflect the on-the-ground reality that mayors deal with every day. We know very well that public safety is our residents’ top priority. We know that our residents must feel safe to thrive and that they want to be able to call 911 and get an appropriate response when they’re in a crisis. We can’t expect people to strive for the American dream if they can’t sleep safely and comfortably. And we can’t expect people to feel safe if they don’t have trust in our police officers to correctly respond to difficult situations.

The status quo isn’t working for many people. It’s not working for crime victims or for the victims of police brutality. We can and must do better for them and for our children. And in this country that has seen too many divisions, we must do it in a way that brings people together.

The White House Know Its Police And Border Policies Are About To Crash,"Something strange is afoot in the party of Jefferson. With the Democrats still spinning after the collapse of their election bill — and progressives furious with the White House’s seeming lack of commitment to that effort — the president has already pivoted, announcing a plan to tackle the violent crime wave besetting American cities.

And the vice president? She’s on her way to the border, 91 days, two countries, and countless laughs after it was first assigned by the boss.

Some might notice that cracking down on rampant crime and tackling a crisis at the border were not topics of discussion when now-President Joe Biden and now-Vice President Kamala (briefly) shared a debate stage two years ago. In fact, it was quite the opposite, littered with jabs and brags about who was more anti-cop or more open-border. So what gives?

If you get your news from Democrats or their palace guards in corporate media, you might think the White House was forced into this by wicked Republicans and dastardly conservative media.

“Republicans, led by former President Donald Trump, are… attempting to pin the rash of violence on the White House, even though increases in gun violence happened during the previous administration,” Politico claimed, as if their readers can’t remember a full year of Democratic defund-the-police schemes.

“Conservative media outlets are carrying a steady stream of foreboding headlines highlighting the rise of year-over-year shootings and homicides,” they added, for good measure.

“Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to the U.S.-Mexico border this week,” Politico opened another article, “amid an unrelenting chorus of criticism from Republicans over her failure to visit there.”

“Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki even said during Wednesday’s press conference, citing the GOP’s pushback on a Democratic social-workers bill.

Of course, none of the above scribes actually think Republican Party pressure is the reason for this about-face, and even Psaki is smart enough to look embarrassed to try the talking point, nearly walking it back right away.

They all know that the only real reason a political party shifts focus so dramatically from its goals to issues it wishes it could avoid is terrible internal polling: numbers coming back predicting election disasters, battleground states looking dicey, voters across the country responding negatively.

People don’t admit it when this is the reason (unless they’re Don Lemon, who leaked CNN’s internal polling and is a special person), but it’s the same thing we saw when Democrats reversed course on last summer’s deadly riots and the ongoing lockdowns.

And we saw it in real time in New York City, the liberal capital of the East, when on Tuesday a former New York Police Department captain who promised to tackle crime and put more cops on the streets came in first place in the mayoral election and is likely on the path to victory.

How’d he pull it off? “His message,” the Intelligencer reports, “almost singularly emphasized fighting crime (the top issue among all Democratic voters)… He campaigned on increasing the NYPD’s budget and presence on the streets after many candidates initially embraced ‘defund the police’ rhetoric following citywide protests against the police last summer.”

Primary elections are about as trustworthy a poll as you can get, and Democrats are finally listening. But here’s their quagmire: They don’t have a single solution. Both the crisis at the border and the crisis in the cities are the direct results of their policies of dropping enforcement of crime in both places, and what do Biden and Harris want to do in response? Crack down on gun-store owners and fix the economies of Central America.

Lofty goals, both, but it wasn’t a gun-store owner who dragged two young parents from their car and executed them in the street over the weekend or shot 52 other people in the city of Chicago alone. Unless there’s been the largest single one-year increase in gun store owners illegally selling handguns since the country started keeping such records in the 20th century, it doesn’t explain what The Washington Post called “the largest single one-year increase in homicides since the country started keeping such records in the 20th century.” Bullets don’t fall from the sky, and undermining and punishing and demoralizing police isn’t consequence-free.

While grueling poverty once trapped Central Americans in Central America, with increased wealth came increased access to internet, cell phones, and the money needed to pay criminal cartels to smuggle humans. While a roaring economy would undoubtedly severely curtail illegal immigration, Harris’s ability to create one here or there approaches zero, despite her best efforts, leaving enforcement of America’s border laws the only immediate salve.

The Democratic Party is careening for a collision with reality, and voters are catching on. Their ability to reverse several planks of the new left and avoid the crash, however, looks near-impossible.

BLM May Now Have To Admit What Really Happened In Lafayette Park,"A federal judge on Monday dismissed all but two of the claims Black Lives Matter and several individual demonstrators brought against Donald Trump, William Barr, and others in the sprawling lawsuit filed after the clearing of Lafayette Square on June 1, 2020.

Bigger than this legal defeat, however, was the report from the inspector general of the Department of the Interior disproving many of the substantive allegations in the plaintiffs’ complaint — all of which the court had accepted as true in its 50-page opinion.

Attorneys for BLM and the demonstrators now face the unpleasant choice of reframing their case, and thus acknowledging the falsity of their initial allegations, or risking sanctions for alleging facts without evidentiary support.

Court Assumed BLM Complaints Were True

In an opinion issued earlier this week, Judge Dabney Friedrich analyzed the claims Black Lives Matter and several individual plaintiffs brought against a bevy of defendants, including former President Trump, former Attorney General Barr, the U.S. Park Police, the D.C. National Guard, the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Arlington County Police Department, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as well as individual officers working for the various agencies.

Before delving into the various constitutional and statutory claims, Friedrich made clear he “must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint” at this stage of the litigation. This governing standard created an interesting dynamic because the complaints (which were amended three times before the court addressed the defendants’ motions to dismiss) and the corresponding oral argument predated the report from the inspector general. Released earlier this month, that report undermined the prevailing narratives about the clearing of Lafayette Park.

So, in deciding the defendants’ motions to dismiss — a procedure used to quickly toss out a case because the alleged facts fail to support a legal claim — the court cited the falsehoods or half-truths of the complaint. “Peaceful protesters assembled in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House,” the court quoted, when “officials, wielding batons, sprayed the crowd with tear gas, flash-bang grenades, smoke bombs, and rubber bullets.”

According to the complaint, law enforcement did this “to clear the area to permit the President to walk to a photo opportunity at a nearby church.” The plaintiffs further alleged (and the opinion recounted) “the Department of Justice has officially acknowledged that Defendant Barr ordered Lafayette Square cleared minutes before the assault started.” Some of the plaintiffs alleged — in addition to Arlington County Police Department officers, Secret Service agents, and Park Police — officers from D.C. Metropolitan Police Department had assisted in the clearing of Lafayette Square.

Claims Contradicted by Inspector General’s Report

During oral argument last month, the plaintiffs’ lawyers hammered these same points, with attorney Randy Mastro proclaiming “Attorney General Barr incredibly shows up himself to survey the scene, looks at the assembled crowd, and then gives the order, ‘Clear the park.’”

“Several minutes later,” according to Mastro, “law enforcement advanced on the peaceful protesters, spraying them with tear gas, pelleting them with rubber bullets, dropping smoke bombs and incendiary grenades, and using their shields and batons like weapons.” He further stressed this was all so “the president could cross a cleared path to do a photo op in front of a church.”

The American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing BLM, Scott Michelman, also pushed many of these allegations, and even brought up newspaper articles to support them. “These articles,” Michelman explained to the court, “are only in here to establish that as unbelievable as these events are to most of us and as shocked as we were to learn about them, they are corroborated not only by the eyewitness accounts that we give in the complaint but also by other news articles to show the court that we’re not making these things up.”

What articles exactly did Michelman cite in the complaint? Among others, they included the Washington Post’s “Inside the Push to Teargas Protesters Ahead of a Trump Photo Op,” and a Reuters YouTube video entitled “Peaceful Protesters Fired at with Tear Gas, Rubber Bullets by U.S. Military Police.”

[scribd id=512911279 key=key-plyLUsrndaGhhJ1VDKgb mode=scroll]

But the inspector general’s report, released just more than a week after the court heard arguments on the motion to dismiss, disproved many of the plaintiffs’ allegations. For instance, the report refuted the spin that the protests were peaceful, noting the two days prior saw 49 Park Service officers injured and federal and private property vandalized.

More significantly, the inspector general concluded the Park Police “cleared the park to allow the contractor to safely install the anti-scale fencing in response to destruction of property and injury to officers” that had occurred the days before. It was not cleared “to allow the President to survey the damage and walk to St. John’s Church.”

Further, the Metropolitan Police had not participated in the clearing of Lafayette Square. However, it appears to be the only law enforcement entity that used CS gas (known colloquially as tear gas) on protesters outside of the park.

Most of BLM’s Claims Dismissed

In Monday’s opinion, while the district court noted there is “some dispute about whether the D.C. defendants were personally involved in clearing Lafayette Square,” the judge made no mention of the inspector general’s report nor its findings that the park was not cleared for a photo op. But even accepting the plaintiffs’ numerous allegations (many of which the report contradicted), the court nonetheless dismissed all but two of the claims.

Of the two claims that weren’t dismissed, the court first held the plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently stated First Amendment claims against the D.C. and Arlington County law enforcement officers. According to the complaints, those officials used force to disperse “a crowd of peaceful protestors who were exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Second, the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim against the federal government, seeking injunctive relief, survived because it “challenged the continued restrictions on access to Lafayette Square.” Significantly, though, it is the Biden administration that must answer for these purported infringements on the plaintiffs’ free speech rights.

In litigating these remaining claims, the plaintiffs must now decide how to handle the inspector general’s report, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Rule 11 provides that a lawyer, when “signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating,” a position, is certifying “to the best of [his] knowledge, information, and belief … the factual contentions have evidentiary support or … will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.”

Given the inspector general’s investigation and report, a lawyer would be hard-pressed to keep arguing many of the complaint’s original allegations. Should the plaintiffs’ attorneys do so, they could be subject to sanctions. But pivoting from the “Trump tear-gassed protesters for a photo op” angle will prove challenging — the corrupt media couldn’t bring themselves to do so.

Will Black Lives Matter be able to? We should know soon when the group responds to the court’s Monday ruling.

How Turning Over Cops To The Federal Government Backfired On Seattle,"When Seattle’s City Council voted unanimously to cut millions of dollars from its police budget amid the uproar over the murder of George Floyd, it ran into an unlikely roadblock: the federal government. U.S. District Judge James Robart ruled that the city couldn’t defund its own police department without his permission.

The judge was acting under the mandate granted him by a 2012 consent decree put in place after John T. Williams, a native American woodcarver, was shot four times by a Seattle police officer in 2010. The killing was ruled unjustified. The consent decree — a sort of civil plea bargain — was one of several with police departments across the country arranged under pressure from the Obama Justice Department as it sought to end alleged civil rights abuses by police in cities from Baltimore to Cleveland to Ferguson, Mo.

And now, after being sharply curtailed by the Trump administration, consent decrees are back. In one of his first major actions as President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland in April rescinded the Trump policy limiting them. Days later he announced an investigation into Floyd’s death, which is expected to result in a consent decree with Minneapolis.

That raises the question: Do consent decrees work? Do they help or hinder police in providing public safety? Do they protect citizens from abusive police practices?

The Surrender of Local Control

The answer is necessarily subjective, in part because it’s hard to isolate the factors affecting crime and policing. Still, it seems clear that the record of consent decrees is mixed at best, and the surrender of local control, as in Seattle, may have a good deal to do with it.

Seattle has seen a marked increase in violent crime between 2013, the first full year its cop shop came under consent decree, and 2020. There were 52 homicides in 2020, compared with 19 in 2013. The total number of violent crimes rose by nearly 25% over that time. The increase in violent crime holds even accounting for the growth in Seattle’s population over the last decade.

Los Angeles, on the other hand, showed improvement, according to researchers from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. After nearly a decade under a pre-Obama consent decree, according to the researchers, “The quality of service to residents is higher, the perception of the LAPD as fair has risen, and the use of force is down.” The LA consent decree was finally lifted in 2013.

The judge overseeing the Ferguson decree — imposed after the 2014 police killing of a young black man, Michael Brown — said at a “status conference” last year that “things have not gone as quickly as we had hoped and as the Consent Decree anticipated, but I believe that great progress has been made.”

A study of the Baltimore police by the American Civil Liberties Union was less positive about results of the decree imposed after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in police custody. Aggressive cops “get caught and they pretend to go into reform mode,” said one lawyer interviewed for the report. Soon “people forget about it and they do it again.”

This month, the head of Cleveland’s police union blamed that city’s consent decree for growing gun crime and other lawlessness. “The homicide rate is up crazy,” union president Jeff Follmer said. “[H]ow about let the police do their job and maybe some of these numbers go down?”

Follmer might be onto something: The loss of local control, a defining characteristic of consent decrees, means that one of the fundamental responsibilities of local government is handled at a distance. Do police departments improve under federal control? Do citizens get the sort of policing they think is best for their communities? One might consider the recent experience of the Seattle Police Department, as effectively presided over by Judge — and de facto Police Commissioner — Robart.

Critics of consent decrees say the court-governed agreements hinder reform by taking responsibility away from democratically elected officials, whether a given decree has to do with law enforcement or any other issue, such as environmental regulations or the provision of special education. With authority in the hands of unelected, unaccountable judges, monitors, and commissions, change can take years, even decades — if there is change at all.

A Seattle Case Study

Seattle’s consent decree did indeed establish a Community Police Commission, whose membership was supposed to be “representative of the many and diverse communities in Seattle, including members from each precinct of the City, police officer unions, faith communities, minority, ethnic, and other community organizations, and student or youth organizations.”

But it turns out that diverse membership does not a democracy make. Community representatives do not bear the same burdens as elected leaders. And their power relative to the judge is still limited, which may be an understatement. “The Commission’s reports and recommendations,” the consent decree promises, “will be posted to the City’s Website.”

David Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School, and co-author of the book “Democracy by Decree,” an influential critique of “What Happens When Courts Run Government,” argues that authority must be tied to representation. “The way democracy is supposed to work,” he told RealClearInvestigations, “is for key policies to be made by elected officials. They are responsible.”

Advocates for consent decrees, by contrast, argue that “local police departments can’t reform themselves,” as Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law, put it in the Los Angeles Times. “Bring on the feds.”

Bring on the feds they did in Seattle, but in practice, the feds may well halt reform — cementing long-standing police practices, and hindering lawmakers’ ability to make timely changes.

The federal investigation into Seattle’s policing that resulted in its consent decree was led by a U.S. attorney, Jenny Durkan. She came from a prominent political family in Washington state described as West Coast Kennedys. Durkan’s federal Department of Justice experience and political ambitions came together when she successfully ran for mayor of Seattle in 2017, trumpeting her role in putting the Seattle Police Department (SPD) under the consent decree. “Durkan’s tenure as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington,” the Seattle Times wrote in an election season profile, “is the cornerstone of her campaign.”

But the city arguably paid a price for the consent decree Durkan helped secure, and then ran on – the city lost control of its ability to respond to crises involving its police department. Years of training in “Use of Force Principles,” and “Weapon-Specific Policies” mandated by the decree left law enforcement unprepared for the protests and riots of last summer. Local officials were appalled at the SPD’s use of tear gas, “blast balls” and other crowd-control weapons, and last July the Seattle City Council voted 9-0 to ban them.

The council also took up the call to “defund the police,” voting to shift millions of dollars out of the police budget. Mayor Durkan opposed the action, but the lawmakers overruled her veto. And yet, they were stonewalled. It was not police who found themselves hobbled by federal oversight. Instead, the uniformly liberal city council was. It was repeatedly blocked in its efforts to defund the police and limit the weapons that could be used for crowd control as a consequence of the consent decree.

When Seattle copped to a consent decree rather than fight the DOJ’s determination that its policing was discriminatory, violent, and unconstitutional, its police department found itself answering to Judge Robart. (Judge Robart would become nationally known for halting President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending immigration from terrorism-linked countries.)

Judge Robart declared Seattle couldn’t make changes to policing in the city without his permission, even though he admitted he might not have been an infallible expert on the issues: “I can’t tell you today if blast balls are a good idea or a bad idea,” Robart said in July 2020, “but I know that sometime a long time ago I approved them.” This matter of expertise alone is one of the problems with consent decrees.

“Last summer we asked the court to maintain the consent decree in the face of outsized police response to mostly peaceful protests,” councilmember Lisa Herbold recently wrote in a newsletter to her constituents. Now “we are faced with a consent decree that is a barrier to passage of policy regulating the use of weapons like blast balls and tear gas.” The consent decree had also become a barrier, Herbold said, “to the Council fulfilling our commitment to reduce [the Seattle Police Department’s] budget to hold them accountable.”

Judge Robart went still further. He not only blocked lawmakers from implementing policy reforms, but dressed them down for not recognizing his authority. “I have some rather harsh words for the City Council over the last six months or so,” Robart declared this past February. “I think they have lost sight of the fact that the 100 paragraphs in the consent decree are not 100 paragraphs. They are not even commitments. They are obligations, orders from this court of things that will be done,” Robart said. “And when they decide to take matters into their own hands in contravention of the Consent Decree, then they drag me into a situation that I don’t want to be in, which is telling them, ‘No, you can’t do that.’”

RealClearInvestigation submitted questions to Judge Robart about his control over Seattle police operations. A clerk replied: “Judge Robart does not respond to media inquiries on active matters before the court.” That may be a reasonable judicial policy, but it also means an individual governing a big city police department might go years without taking questions on how he’s doing the job.

According to Seattle’s consent decree monitor, Antonio Oftelie, the important thing is that local governments abide by the terms of their commitments. If “budget cuts erode the ability of the City to meet its basic obligations, the city may fall out of compliance with the consent decree,” Oftelie told RealClearInvestigations.

Adrian Diaz, who became Seattle’s new police chief in September, made it clear he embraces the consent decree. In February, Diaz declared that the SPD had collaborated in developing the ongoing monitoring plan under which the department’s adherence to the consent decree would be judged. He made it clear that he answered to federal authorities: “This plan formalizes SPD deliverables.”

Not Consent of the Governed but of the Government

But where does federal authority leave room for local lawmakers’ preferred policies to be tested? “Defunding” the police may be a good idea; it may be a terrible idea. But without responsibility for the outcome, legislators don’t have to answer for their role in the policy chosen. With judges dictating policy, Schoenbrod says, accountability is lost. Elected officials can say “The court made us do it.”

Michael Morley, professor at Florida State University College of Law, contends that — consistent with Seattle’s experience — consent decrees tend to entrench one or another set of policies and stifle change, rather than spur reforms. Such decrees in effect represent the consent not of the governed, but of the government.

Morley told RealClearInvestigation that state and local “government entities enthusiastically embrace decrees because the decrees guarantee spending.” Rather than being punitive, consent decrees often lead cities to increase the budgets of problem departments, spending millions on training and new technologies. The targets of consent decrees, Morley said, regularly use the agreements to secure and protect resources.

As for Seattle Mayor Durkan, her tenure having been a muddle, she announced she will not seek reelection in November. But she doesn’t blame her lame duck status on her entanglement with the consent decree. While Mayor Durkan’s office did not answer questions from RealClearInvestigations, she applauded, in an open letter to the Attorney General, his decision “to rescind the Trump Administration’s limits on consent decrees”. Even though the decree she had imposed on Seattle thwarted democratic decision-making and accountability in the city, Durkan declared such decrees had been “critical to creating new policies, more training, new investigative oversight, new civilian oversight, and more transparency in data and reporting.”

But not more democracy.

Portland Police Try To Fend Off Angry Mob By Disclosing The Man They Shot Is White,"The Portland Police Bureau tried to fend off an angry mob of rioters on Thursday by disclosing that a man shot in an officer confrontation was white.

“There is erroneous information being circulated on social media regarding in the officer involved shooting in the Lloyd district. We can confirm that the subject involved is an adult white male. No one else was injured,” Portland Police tweeted on Thursday night.

Chief of Police Chuck Lovell said that “preliminary information suggests officer encountered a very difficult and dynamic situation that no officer wants to face,” but that did not stop a crowd of protestors from forming at the scene shortly after the man who was shot was taken to the hospital.

As the night went on, reports suggest that the crowd went from protesting to rioting.

“Police said people in the crowd threw objects and that someone grabbed an officer’s baton. Another officer intervened and was sprayed with a chemical,” a local news outlet reported.

The unrest sparked a response from the city’s police department which has struggled to manage riots over the last year and recently experienced a mass exodus of officers over a fellow officer’s indictment and “dangerous” mob situations.

An Oregon newspaper used the same attention-shifting tactic in April when it included the race of a white man who was fatally shot by police in its coverage. The Oregonian later clarified that they included the man’s race because it was important “in light of social unrest prompted by police shootings of Black people.”

“Recent shootings include Daunte Wright, who was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb earlier this week, and two killings in Clark County in recent months,” the publication explained, nodding to the fact that those fatal shootings sparked rioting, looting, and other destruction.

"Amid Surging Crime Rates And Murders, Oakland City Council Votes To Defund Police","Despite recently receiving $190 million from the Biden Administration, the City Council of Oakland, California voted Thursday to defund their police department by almost $18 million. The city’s crime rates have skyrocketed, seeing a 90 percent increase in murders, 88 percent increase in carjackings, and 70 percent increase in shootings all in the last year.

Sixty-five lives have been lost, and 1,300 robberies have been recorded, yet, the city redirected police funds toward the Department of Violence Prevention, “with the intention of improving public safety” via alternate means.

On Monday, the Department of Violence Prevention’s chief was interrupted during an on-camera interview by an attempted armed robbery. The department’s chief was being interviewed on the steps of Oakland City Hall, when they were attacked. The suspects remain outstanding.

Rather than help police officers confront Oakland’s growing crisis, the city plans to fund the employment of “violence interrupters” and “community ambassadors.” This redirection of funds will increase police vacancies, leading to slower emergency response times.

Despite receiving $190 million from the Biden admin, Oakland’s city council voted last week to cut $18 million from the police. In March, Oakland’s Democrat mayor praised the Defund the Police movement while touting new federal funds. There goes @PressSec‘s new talking point! — Chad Gilmartin (@ChadGilmartinCA) June 29, 2021

The Anti Police-Terror Project applauded the city’s reallocation of funds, but Oakland Mayor Libby Shaaf pushed back.

“[The new budget],” she said, “cuts 50 police officers who respond to Oaklanders’ 911 calls and enforce traffic safety. It also cuts much-needed future academies, which will significantly reduce police staffing and delay response to Oaklanders in their time of crisis.” Shaaf added that the budget “will force [Oakland police] officers to work even more overtime shifts, which are expensive and unsafe for officers and residents alike.”

Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong strongly condemned the new budget. “Today we find ourselves in a crisis,” he said. “[C]rime is out of control in the city.” It doesn’t make sense to defund the police, he argued.

“[One of our city leaders] referred to [the crime surge] as a ‘bump in the road,’ a ‘speed bump’” Armstrong said. “[W]ell for me, those speed bumps are 65 lives so far this year, victims who have suffered at the hands of violence, whether it’s shootings, robberies, carjackings, [or] sexual assault. All of these crimes are not speed bumps. These are people.”

“Far too often in these meetings, we are talking about numbers, we are talking about money and cost,” Armstrong continued. “I don’t know what the cost of a life is, but I know not having resources makes our city less safe. It concerns me that we would ever consider that to be a bump in the road.”

Armstrong pleaded for City Council to take the suffering of Oakland’s residents seriously. “[T]hese are true people,” he reminded them. “These are people who lost their lives in this city. […] When I go to scenes and I meet with mothers and family members, they’re not talking about numbers, they’re talking about their children.”

Armstrong soon became so overtaken by grief that he fell into silence. Breathing heavily, he tried to prepare himself to continue. “Saturday night, I went out to a scene of a young man that lost his life. And a lady yelled out the window, ‘Do something about it!’” he recalled. Armstrong desperately wants to “do something” about his city’s crime surge, but he says that he and his colleagues aren’t being given the support they need.

“Without the resources, it makes it challenging to make Oakland safe, and more families find themselves dealing with trauma,” Armstrong argued.

"After Slashing Police Budget, Majority Of San Francisco Residents Now Want More Police","A new poll shows a majority of San Francisco residents think it is time to increase police presence in areas affected by high rates of crime.

The annual San Francisco Chamber of Commerce report found 76 percent of residents want more police in high-crime areas, and 80 percent believe crime has accelerated. Polling was done by EMC Research from May 25 to 31, and respondents affirmed this sentiment “across gender, age, ethnicity, party affiliation, and neighborhood, and homeownership status.”

250 registered voters were polled. 60 percent of respondents agreed the city ought to keep funding law enforcement academies and 88 percent indicated homelessness has grown worse. The city had the sixth-highest number of homeless residents in 2020.

San Francisco, a reliably left-wing stronghold, has been gripped by the “defund the police” movement. Democrat Mayor London Breed announced a plan last summer to slash $120 million from the police and sheriff’s department budget.

However, after a major crime surge last year that resulted in a 36.7 percent increase in killings and a 753 percent increase in car break-ins at the police department’s primary station, Breed seemed to regret her decision. The mayor unveiled a plan in May to increase police in high-crime neighborhoods.

“To sustain the Community Ambassadors’ efforts for the longer-term, the Mayor is including funding in her two-year budget proposal, including $5 million in the first year and $3.8 million in the second year, while UC Hastings has dedicated $3 million in State funding,” a city press release stated. “Working together in partnership with the Mayor’s administration, UC Hastings has sought and received the support of Governor Newsom, who has included in his May Revision budget proposal an allocation of $3 million over three years to fund Urban Alchemy’s services contiguous to its campus.”

Still, the money approved to be cut from the budget will go toward the “underserved Black community,” a broad term to be understood as taking the form of police being instructed not to respond to non-criminal complaints and conduct “anti-bias” training.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/29/less-than-a-year-after-slashing-police-budget-majority-of-san-francisco-residents-now-want-more-police-presence/,2021-06-29
"'Defund The Police' Was Always A Democrat Goal, Not A Republican One","White House press secretary Jen Psaki continues to perpetuate the lie that Republicans were the political party set on defunding the police. The White House spin machine appears to be working overtime to ensure this false narrative takes off, but evidence shows that Democrats, not Republicans, are the ones who always wanted to defund the police.

Ever since calls of “all cops are b-stards” and “defund the police” made their way to center stage during the summer of rage in 2020, Democrat-led city councils in Austin, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Minneapolis voted to divert funds away from law enforcement. Despite the recent national and local crime surge in murders, carjackings, and shootings, the City Council of Oakland, California voted last week to defund their police department by almost $18 million.

Other Democrat-led cities that chose to slash their policing budgets last summer, such as San Francisco, are now struggling to meet residents’ demands for higher police presence at the police department’s primary station amid a 36.7 percent increase in killings and a 753 percent increase in car break-ins. Now, Democrat Mayor London Breed has plans to increase policing in high-crime areas less than a year after proudly proposing a $120 million cut from the police and sheriff’s department budget.

Countless Democrat politicians and candidates have also used “defund the police” as part of their brand and platform. Just last week, progressive activist India Walton ousted longtime Democrat Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown after focusing her socialist-endorsed campaign on pulling funds from law enforcement.

If we want real public safety we need to invest in our communities, not keep throwing more police at the problem. pic.twitter.com/ulacgKUUS4 — India Walton From Buffalo (@Indiawaltonbflo) May 18, 2021

Other sitting politicians such as “squad” members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib have egged on demands to defund the police and offered their own extreme statements about law enforcement.

“Defunding police means defunding police. It does not mean budget tricks or funny math,” AOC said in June 2020.

“Policing in our country is inherently & intentionally racist,” Tlaib tweeted in April. “Daunte Wright was met with aggression & violence. I am done with those who condone government funded murder. No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can’t be reformed.”

It wasn't an accident. Policing in our country is inherently & intentionally racist. Daunte Wright was met with aggression & violence. I am done with those who condone government funded murder. No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can't be reformed. — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) April 12, 2021

The informal progressive coalition’s comments do not stand alone. New York Democrat Rep. Jamaal Bowman often calls for defunding law enforcement, which he claims is “more concerned with protecting white supremacy than serving the communities that pay their salaries.”

Too many police in our country are more concerned with protecting white supremacy than serving the communities that pay their salaries. https://t.co/yDdUuw0GRv — Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) March 17, 2021

The accusations don’t end there. According to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s senior adviser, Capitol Police are “white supremacists” and deserve to be defunded. The same committee’s technology office alleged that police are the “modern day slave patrol.”

"Cops Killed Unarmed Hunter Brittain. Unfortunately For His Family, He's White","Chances are you haven’t yet heard about 17-year-old Hunter Brittain who, despite being unarmed, was shot dead by police during a traffic stop. It’s not that this isn’t a shocking and tragic story, but there has been a complete national media blackout on the incident because, unfortunately for Brittain’s family, they’re all white.

Brittain was pulled over in the middle of the night last week in Cabot, Arkansas, for reasons that remain unclear. According to 16-year-old Jordan King, who was in the vehicle with Brittain, the truck was having gear trouble and would not remain in park, so Brittain exited to place a container behind a tire in order to keep it from backing up into the squad car.

That’s when the deputy fired at Brittain, striking him in the neck. King said he never heard the officer command Brittain to halt or return inside the truck. An investigation is underway.

Despite this being one of those “unarmed police shooting deaths” that so often arouse the media, neither the New York Times nor the Washington Post has done a single piece of reporting on the incident. Nothing from CNN nor MSNBC.

Just two days after Brittain’s death, 23-year-old Dimitri Lanahan was also shot dead by police near Fairbanks, Alaska, after brandishing a fake gun. He was white too, so you likely hadn’t heard about that one either.

At least seven other unarmed white people have been killed by police this year, according to a Washington Post database. (A database that users have to search through should not be confused with reporting on, writing on, and giving sustained attention to individual incidents.) Those lives apparently don’t matter as much.

Admittedly, all of the facts aren’t yet known around the circumstances of Brittain’s death. Did he charge at the officer? Did the officer hold a reasonable belief that his safety or the safety of others was at risk? Maybe we’ll find that out when the investigation is complete.

But since when have all the facts mattered? Immediately after Andrew Brown was killed earlier this year, the media were hyping up his case as proof of their complete myth that cops are targeting innocent black people. It turned out Brown had an arrest warrant for dealing cocaine and fentanyl-laced heroin. When police arrived at his home to detain him, body camera footage showed he tried evading the cops in his car, nearly plowing into one of the officers on the scene.

That doesn’t mean he or any one of these people deserved to die, but at minimum, it dramatically changes the degree to which race was a relevant factor, if a factor at all.

Hunter Brittain’s life mattered just as much as Andrew Brown’s. Say his name, even though he’s white.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/30/unarmed-hunter-brittain-was-killed-by-police-but-unfortunately-for-his-family-hes-white/,2021-06-30
Bard College Offers Class Called 'Abolishing Prisons And The Police',"Bard College, a liberal arts institution in upstate New York that was funneled $500 million from billionaire George Soros this year, is offering a course this upcoming Fall instructing students on how to parrot talking points for abolishing prisons and police.

The course “Abolishing Prisons and the Police” aims to teach undergraduates how to “sell abolition to the masses and design a multi-media ad campaign to make prison abolition go viral.” The course description states:

This course explores what’s to be gained, lost and what we can’t imagine about a world without prisons. Through the figure of abolition (a phenomenon we will explore via movements to end slavery, the death penalty, abortion, gay conversion therapy and more) we will explore how and why groups of Americans have sought to bring an absolute end to sources of human suffering. In turn, we will explore a history of the punitive impulse in American social policy and seek to discern means of intervening against it. Finally, on the specific question of prison abolition, we will think through how to ‘sell’ abolition to the masses and design a multi-media ad campaign to make prison abolition go viral.

Bard launched its Hate Studies Initiative in 2018, which is the umbrella the course is operating under. Other courses taught under the Hate Studies Initiative have included “Queer Cinema,” “Capitalism and Slavery,” and “Sanctuary: Engaging State and Local Government for Human Rights.”

The initiative is run by Kenneth S. Stern, who writes for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today. The website says that “Hate studies is defined as ‘Inquiries into the human capacity to define, and then dehumanize or demonize, an ‘other,’ and the processes which inform and give expression to, or can curtail, control, or combat, that capacity.” According to this definition, Bard is openly defining the rule of law as inherently dehumanizing and demonizing.

Kwame Holmes, a Human Rights Project scholar at Bard, is set to teach the fall class. Holmes has a history of calling for the abolition of law enforcement, notably writing an op-ed last year called “Why Abolish the Police?”

Other schools have taught courses on defunding police, such as Indiana University.

Yet Another UChicago Student Was Brutally Murdered By A Stray Bullet,"One of my University of Chicago peers was viciously murdered on Thursday by a stray bullet on a Chicago Green Line CTA elevated train. Like countless other UChicago students, Max Lewis was traveling home after his summer internship downtown, when a bullet came through the train window and struck him in the neck. Lewis passed away after being taken off life support on Sunday. He was 20 years old.

As a rising junior at the University of Chicago, Lewis was excelling. Reading about Lewis’s life, he sounds like the type of person we all hope to be—full of joy, surrounded by friends, and excited for his promising future. He was living in Chicago for the summer to complete a prestigious investment banking internship.

Lewis didn’t have to work in person, but he was such a friendly, dedicated individual that he chose to make the trek downtown. His young life was senselessly cut short when his train ride home was interrupted by yet another Chicago shooting.

According to the police, Lewis was not the intended target of the attack. The case is still being investigated, and no arrests have been made.

""We were crying with the families of other victims of gun violence a the hospital. This is another senseless loss."" University of Chicago student Max Lewis was shot and killed by a stray bullet on the CTA Green Line. More from his loved ones at 5 &6 @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/DOfV560tNk — Megan Hickey (@MeganHickeyTV) July 5, 2021

""He loved working hard for other people because he was so damn selfless. And he never wanted people to thank him for what he did,"" said one friend of Max Lewis. https://t.co/PvQwOoJRA8 — Chicago Sun-Times (@Suntimes) July 6, 2021

“Max was a talented student and beloved campus leader and friend who will be greatly missed,” UChicago stated in a university-wide email. “He was pursuing a double major in economics and computer science, treasurer of the Promontory Investment Research RSO, president of the fraternity AEPi, and actively involved in the student community on campus.”

When reflecting on the loss of his friend and fraternity brother, Zachary Cogan rightly slammed Chicago’s inexcusable violence. “This happens all the time in Chicago,” he emphasized to the Chicago Sun-Times. “It needs to end.”

Cogan wasn’t exaggerating. Lewis is the second UChicago student this year to have his bright future cut short by a deadly shooting in Lightfoot’s lawless city. After receiving a bachelor’s degree at Peking University and a master’s at the University of Cambridge, Yiran Fan was a fourth-year Ph.D. at UChicago. He’d spent his life traveling the world to pursue academics, only to be gunned down in a South Side parking garage in January. He was 30 years old.

Chicago Violence Is Out Of Control

Violence consumes Chicago. During the Fourth of July weekend, more than 90 people were shot in the city, including a 6-year-old girl and her mother, two police officers, and a group of six individuals. Between late Friday afternoon and Monday evening, at least 16 people were murdered in shootings, while two were “fatally stabbed.”

The list of victims is long. A member of the National Guard was murdered in Chicago while leaving a house party. At a mere 19 years old, he was on temporary leave from his basic training, before he was murdered in cold blood. “He was fighting for our country,” his sister said. “He comes to Chicago, and he gets killed in the streets.”

Four children under the age of 14 were also injured in shootings. A 67-year-old man died after being stabbed on a CTA bus. Meanwhile, the city became even more volatile, as “hundreds of young people and Chicago police officers flooded the Loop on Sunday, sometimes clashing while fireworks exploded and some dumpsters caught fire.”

Lightfoot’s city is falling to pieces, but she refuses to effectively address the problem. During a recent press conference, she made the absurd assertion that Chicago “crime is on the decline.”

“All of our major indices show a decline in our crime, and our homicides and our shootings year over year are down,” she claimed. This is such a blatant lie that it’s offensive Lightfoot thinks her fellow Chicagoans are dumb enough to fall for it. We aren’t.

According to NBC News, Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown says “Homicides are up by 5 percent and shootings are up by 17 percent this year compared to the same period last year.” As of mid-June, the Chicago Sun Times reports that 195 more people have been shot in Chicago in 2021 than in 2020, reaching a total of 1,587. This count doesn’t include the 90-plus victims like Lewis who have been viciously attacked since then.

Brown also says criminals are being released and—wait for it—committing more crimes. Imagine that: when Lightfoot fails to hold criminals accountable, they’re emboldened to keep terrorizing her city.

My Leftist Peers Still Want to Abolish the Police

As if leftist radicals’ response to Chicago’s surging crime rates couldn’t get any dumber, members of my university’s incoming student government plan to “work toward the disarming, defunding, and abolition of [the University of Chicago’s Police Department (UCPD)] by amplifying the work of groups such as CareNotCops.”

As a majority black and Hispanic police force, the University of Chicago’s Police Department (UCPD) is the “primary police agency” on UChicago’s campus. If it weren’t for the bravery and dedication of the UCPD, I wouldn’t be safe crossing campus, and my parents wouldn’t allow me to live in the city.

CareNotCops, in contrast, is an extremist campaign dedicated to eradicating the UCPD. Among other endeavors, it’s self-described as “demand[ing] that UChicago end their continued harm on the South Side of Chicago by abolishing the UCPD.”

Last August, CareNotCops staged a week-long occupation outside Provost Ka Yee Lee’s house. Using a megaphone, one of the occupation’s organizers led a group chant, shouting “racist -ss cops.” CareNotCops also organized a January teach-in to discuss eradicating the police. And the campaign continues to promote hatred toward law enforcement. During a May retreat, more than 200 students and community members gathered to “creat[e] art.” Such “art” included a large sign that said, “Cops off campus, cops off earth.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CPY1StchBh4/

Unsurprisingly, the CareNotCops social media accounts are active, but they’ve failed to mention Lewis’s death. Apparently, our peer’s demise doesn’t fit their narrative.

Chicagoans Deserve Better

The tragedy, of course, is that Chicago isn’t just Lightfoot’s city. Nor is it the playground for another CHAZ-inspired fairytale gone wrong. Chicago is home to almost three million Chicagoans, including me.

This home is jeopardized when our incompetent mayor fails to keep criminals off the streets and lies to her constituents. “CareNotCops” exacerbates the problem by prioritizing hateful, childish sloganeering over law and order.

I’ve ridden the CTA countless times. When my friends and I board the train, we shouldn’t fear that we’ll be murdered by stray bullets. When we sit down on the bus, we shouldn’t worry that we’ll be knifed to death. That’s absurd.

Thanks to the incompetence of Lightfoot, this lunacy has become a reality. And if CareNotCops and my incoming student government representatives succeed in defunding the UCPD, the violence will continue to soar.

Beyond my parents and younger brother, UChicago is the only community in which I’ve ever felt truly at home. But, a home is not a home when you’re terrified for your life. Lightfoot and the CareNotCops organizers should be ashamed of themselves. Our city deserves so much better.

In Lewis’s honor, his fraternity launched a GoFundMe to raise money to transport his friends to the funeral in his hometown of Denver, Colorado. The remainder of the funds will go toward charity.

“Max was an intelligent, caring, compassionate member of the UChicago community and a dear friend to many,” the GoFundMe page reads. “He is known amongst friends, peers, and classmates for his kindness, goofiness, grit, impeccable work ethic, and most importantly, his unfailingly genuine soul.” Speaking for the entire community, the page says Lewis “will be sorely missed.”

WATCH: Anti-Police Protesters Disrupt Families Mourning Victims Of Violent Crima,"Video footage shows white, police-hating protesters disrupting black families mourning their dead at a police-sponsored “Stand up for a Safe Oakland” rally in Oakland, California on Saturday. According to the clips, the mourners were infuriated at being infiltrated by radical outsiders.

Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong organized the “Stand up for a Safe Oakland” rally in response to Oakland’s surging crime, because he and his community “cannot sit silent anymore.” During the rally, Oakland residents gathered at Lake Merritt’s Amphitheater to mourn lost community members, as well as to demand an end to the city’s rising violence.

Rather than join Armstrong’s rally, the “Anti-Police Terror Project” held a separate event with community groups on Saturday (though the group claims it made its plans prior to learning of Armstrong’s).

Meanwhile, protesters simultaneously disrupted the event organized by Armstrong. Lee Fang and AntifaWatch say these protesters were members of Antifa, though a spokesman for the Oakland Police Department was unable to confirm whether this was the case or not.

“Surreal moment in Oakland. About 200 mostly black families rally with police to call for an end to the epidemic of gun violence. Mothers at the stage mourning recently murdered children. In the back, less than a dozen mostly white antifa protesters assembled to jeer them,” Investigative journalist at the Intercept, Lee Fang, tweeted.

AntifaWatch reported that “Several #Antifa, who appear to be all white, showed up to ‘protest’ by drowning out mostly black speakers who were naming and remembering homicide victims.”

The protesters held signs with messages like “F-ck OCP” and “Quit your job, kkkop!,” as they shouted with local community members who were gathered to mourn their lost neighbors.

“A white privilege is standing here! You think you have a right to be here — you don’t have a right to be here!” an Oakland resident shouted at the protesters. “Not when black children are dying in the street everyday!” a second woman agreed.

Supporters of the event vehemently pushed back against the protesters’ suggestions that police are the villains. The mourners didn’t want to condemn police officers. They wanted to promote law and order.

“We’re talking about right now. What do you have against safety in Oakland? What do you have against stopping the violence?” a mourning Oakland resident asked the protesters.

“Why are you trying to disrupt something that’s trying to be positive? […] We’re trying to save our people!” the same Oakland resident continued. “We’re trying to save our people!” he repeated. “You are not our people! Get the f-ck out!”

""Black children are dying in the street every day."" ANTIFA: ""Yeah, at the hands of the police."" ""NO!"" ""That's a lie. There are not hundreds of people dead at the hands of police this year."" ""We're trying to save our people. You are not our people. Get the f*ck out!"" https://t.co/bXFgq3sRPf — Vince Coglianese (@VinceCoglianese) July 12, 2021

Armstrong’s event came as crime in Oakland continues to surge. Armstrong himself recently reported that his city is experiencing an approximately 90 percent increase in murders, 70 percent increase in shootings, and 88 percent increase in carjackings.

His goal in facilitating the event was to inspire a multi-pronged approach to fighting crime. Attendees marched from the amphitheater to the location where eight individuals were shot on Juneteenth. And the event included a coffin display with 71 white flowers, representative of the 71 members of the Oakland community who have been murdered in Oakland so far this year. Most of the attendees also wore white t-shirts with the phrase “#SAFEOAKLAND.”

“We continue to see shootings every night in the city,” Armstrong said. “It is time we come together and we unite behind reducing gun violence in the city of Oakland.”

“There are people in our community who don’t feel safe. There are seniors in our community who cannot come out at night. There are young, African-American men and Latino men that are at risk in our city. We have to come together; this is not about politics, this is about saving lives,” Armstrong continued.

Armstrong recently made headlines when he slammed Oakland’s City Council for defunding the police department by nearly $18 million. Since money has been diverted from the police budget to “social services aimed at violence prevention,” he says the community needs to become more actively involved in crime reduction.

Oakland resident Carol Wyatt agreed, saying her city “cannot move past the burials, the memorials and the wakes.” “Gun violence is our community’s longtime pandemic,” she lamented.

“We need your help — we need everyone’s help — because we want this to be the safest Oakland that we can possibly make it,” Brenda Grisham said. Her 17-year-old son was shot and murdered in Oakland in 2010. Grisham says “It’s on all of us to build a safer city.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/12/anti-police-protesters-disrupt-black-families-mourning-victims-of-violent-crime-in-oakland/,2021-07-12
"Democrats Are Fleeing 'Defund The Police,' But Can They Shift Course?","The Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City launched a blitz on his party’s leadership Monday, heading first to the White House and then to a meeting with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to bring his pro-law-and-order, anti-Defund-the-Police message to party leadership.

The meetings capped a week of constant fire for the Defund the Police wing of the left — a movement that rose from radical street activists to Congress with the rise of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her band of followers, before blasting into orbit — and policy — after the death of George Floyd.

The past week kicked off with the certified nomination of Eric Adams, who is now the favorite to succeed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. His win follows a 50 percent increase in murders between May 2019 and May 2021. Shootings are up 166 percent; rape, 53 percent. Although some in the New York Police Department have long regarded Eric Adams as a career politician rather than “a cop’s cop,” his campaign focused heavily on law and order and the deadly impact of anti-police activist plans everywhere, and especially in boroughs such as his own.

New York is not alone. “It’s a combustible fire that is getting ready to explode,” Malik Evans said more than 300 miles up the state, in Rochester, where he had defeated the incumbent for the Democrats’ mayoral nomination.

Across the country in Oakland, California, Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong was momentarily silenced by emotion as he pleaded in late June with an obstinate city council for resources to fight a 90 percent spike in murders, 88 percent increase in car-jackings, and a 70 percent rise in shootings. “These are true people,” he said. “These are people who lost their lives in this city.”

The story is the same everywhere you look, anywhere in the country that chased the “defund” theory.

Democratic Whip James Clyburn lent his voice to the fray Thursday, arguing with an MSNBC host who pushed the left-wing claim that Democratic leadership, rather than “defund,” is to blame for sharp spikes in crime. “That’s absolute poppycock,” the top South Carolina Democrat said. “I’m out here with the voters every day. I did a town hall meeting last night in Jasper County, South Carolina, and I can tell you, ‘defund the police’ is a non-starter, even with black people.”

“And if you don’t think that’s true,” he continued, “then look at the results of what just happened in New York City’s election. So the proof is in the pudding. I know what I’m talking about. I talk to people every day, and ‘defund the police’ is a chokehold around the Democratic Party.”

Back in Oakland, the southern Democrat’s claims rang true Saturday. That day, mostly black voters mourning their community’s murder victims at a “Stand Up For A Safe Oakland” rally organized by Armstrong clashed with mostly white Antifa radicals, who attempted to shout them down. “Not when black children are dying in the street everyday!” one woman yelled at the hecklers.

Clyburn is a big deal to President Joe Biden. After losing the Iowa and Nevada caucuses, and getting shut out in the New Hampshire primary, things were looking bad for a visibly aged and mentally wandering Biden before Clyburn’s endorsement, combined with a concentrated pro-Biden corporate media and Democrat National Convention campaign, pushed the former vice president to victory in South Carolina, followed by a slew of further wins and the eventual nomination. When the South Carolina congressman speaks, the White House should listen.

But their first set of solutions, meekly offered after Adams’s first-round primary win (and near-certain internal polling results), don’t quite satisfy. “Those priorities really were misplaced,” Adams told CNN Sunday, referring to a larger Democrat focus on AR rifles but still praising the president. “The numbers of those who are killed by handguns are astronomical and if we don’t start having real federal legislation, matched with states and cities, we’re never going to get this crisis under control.”

“You’re seeing a Democratic Party, basically they’ve thrown up their hands,” Adams told “CBS This Morning” on Sunday. “We’re continuing to see the same problems in our inner cities.”

But aside from the call to hire more police, the White House has no solutions that aren’t doomed, and the party’s allowance — and outright fostering — of the radical left have forced Democratic leadership into a bind. While hiring more police seems a good idea, with the Defund movement the question was never money, President Joe Biden’s stated fix. Awash in $190 million in federal funds and beset by a murderous crime spike, Oakland, for example, pushed ahead with an $18 million cut to its police less than three weeks ago.

“[One of our city leaders] referred to [the crime surge] as a ‘bump in the road,’ a ‘speed bump,'” Chief Armstrong said just after. “[W]ell for me, those speed bumps are 65 lives so far this year, victims who have suffered at the hands of violence, whether it’s shootings, robberies, car-jackings, [or] sexual assault. All of these crimes are not speed bumps — these are people.”

Back in New York, every move Adams makes is sure to provoke Ocasio-Cortez, whose voter base is in the Bronx. Back in D.C., her fan club is sure to turn the screws on Clyburn, Pelosi, and any other progressive who crosses them.

If murdered children, raped sisters, and frightened mothers in their own districts and cities won’t change their minds, how can Biden?

Joy Reid Finds A Police Shooting Of Unarmed Person She Can Support,"Every time a black person is shot by police, leftists immediately adopt a blank stare and start acting like there is absolutely no need for a cop to ever draw his weapon unless he’s sure that the suspect has a bomb that’s about to detonate.

He was unarmed! He was trying to escape! The reasonable thing would have been to let him go!

But now we’re talking about 35-year-old white woman Ashli Babbitt, the only person to have died by direct violence at the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and, well, there are apparently some instances where it actually is okay for a cop to fire his weapon on a criminal.

Just as one example, MSNBC Joy Reid said in May that she felt “sick” watching the police body camera footage of the attempted arrest of Andrew Brown in Elizabeth City, N.C., which ended in a shooting and Brown’s death. “Just sitting here at home watching American police descend into a residential neighborhood, armed up like a military unit like it’s a war zone and blow a man away in his car … to affect a … drugs arrest,” she tweeted. “And the [district attorney] is saying this is all fine. I feel sick.”

By “drugs arrest,” what Reid is referring to is the warrant against Brown for dealing cocaine and fentanyl-laced heroin in the neighborhood. Brown had a litany of previous convictions, 12 of which were drug-related. An autopsy also turned up a baggy of what appeared to be crystal meth inside his mouth. (But remember, this is just a “drugs arrest.”)

When police arrived at Brown’s home to detain him, body camera footage showed he tried evading the cops in his car, nearly plowing into one of the officers on the scene.

Now let’s compare that to what Reid said this week about the shooting death of Babbitt.

On her show Tuesday night, Reid referred to the widely seen video recording of the moment Babbitt was shot in the upper chest by an officer who was guarding the House floor. Reid said that Babbitt was “part of the violent mob trying to force their way into the House chamber” and that, “Police had their guns drawn but Babbitt ignored their warnings.”

Babbitt had tried climbing through a broken door window, and that’s when she was fired upon. She bled out right there.

Reid continued, “As the video clearly shows, that officer did what was necessary under difficult and unpredictable circumstances.”

Fascinating! On the one hand, it makes her “sick” to see officers fire upon a man resisting arrest as he attempts to speed off toward the direction of houses in a residential neighborhood. On the other, she sees the necessity to shoot an unarmed woman climbing through a window because those were “difficult and unpredictable circumstances.”

The shooting of Babbitt appears justified. The circumstances really were difficult and unpredictable.

But the same is true for the shooting of Brown and most of the other shootings of unarmed suspects that gain media attention because of some racial component. Resisting arrest and, even worse, attempting to flee is not always, and perhaps not usually, a harmless act. It has the potential to put the lives of pedestrians, passersby, neighbors, and of course the arresting officers at risk.

Reid apparently has the capacity to grasp the concept. But only under very specific circumstances of race.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/15/joy-reid-finally-finds-a-police-shooting-death-of-an-unarmed-person-she-can-support/,2021-07-15
"Terry McAuliffe Accepts Pro-Abortion, Anti-Police Group Endorsement","Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe accepted an endorsement this week from NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, a pro-abortion advocacy group that has called for defunding the police.

“I’m proud to be endorsed by @NARALVirginia,” McAuliffe said in a recent tweet. “With a right-wing Supreme Court ready to hack away at the right to choose and Glenn Youngkin promising to ban abortion, reproductive freedom is at stake in this race. I’ll always fight to protect the right to choose.” The former governor has publicly supported legislation that would legalize abortion up until the moment of birth.

I’m proud to be endorsed by @NARALVirginia. With a right-wing Supreme Court ready to hack away at the right to choose and Glenn Youngkin promising to ban abortion, reproductive freedom is at stake in this race. I’ll always fight to protect the right to choose. pic.twitter.com/bySHCdytge — Terry McAuliffe (@TerryMcAuliffe) July 19, 2021

While abortion remains NARAL Virginia’s primary cause, the organization has waded into additional political issues in recent years. Following the death of George Floyd last year and the protests and riots that followed, the advocacy group came out in favor of defunding the police in June 2020.

“ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,” it said. “Defund the police. Invest in Black communities. Tell Donald Trump to resign.”

The organization’s national arm, NARAL Pro-Choice America, has also repeatedly called for defunding law enforcement, claiming police have refused to deal with the “systemic racism” in their profession.

“It’s past time to defund the police,” the group said in April 2021. “After multiple failed attempts to change the culture of policing, it’s clear that police have not succeeded in reckoning with the generations of systemic racism, oppression, and state violence it has engaged in.”

It’s past time to defund the police. After multiple failed attempts to change the culture of policing, it’s clear that police have not succeeded in reckoning with the generations of systemic racism, oppression, and state violence it has engaged in. We must continue to do better. — NARAL (@NARAL) April 20, 2021

We have to meet this moment by dismantling the systems of oppression that are still so entrenched in society. We have to defund the police. We have to achieve racial justice. We have to end the Black maternal mortality crisis. Reproductive freedom won't be possible until we do. — NARAL (@NARAL) April 18, 2021

Being forced to live in constant fear of state violence is a risk to every fundamental freedom we hold dear. It’s clear that there will never be reproductive freedom until we have the freedom to live without the threat of racist violence. It’s time to defund the police. — NARAL (@NARAL) April 16, 2021

Since announcing his candidacy for governor in December 2020, McAuliffe has seemingly taken an antagonistic position toward law enforcement. During a Democrat primary debate in May, the former governor came out in support of ending qualified immunity for police officers. Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects government officials, such as law enforcement, from liability unless they violate clearly established statutory or constitutional law.

When asked whether McAuliffe agrees with NARAL’s position on defunding police, his campaign did not return The Federalist’s request for comment.

Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin was quick to criticize the former governor, with a campaign spokeswoman blasting McAuliffe for accepting the endorsement.

“Terry McAuliffe proudly accepted the endorsement of an extreme organization which supports taxpayer-funded abortion, supports late-term abortions, and wants to defund the police,” Youngkin press secretary Macaulay Porter told The Federalist. “The majority of Virginians do not support McAuliffe’s extreme pro-abortion and anti-police agenda.”

Why Is Violent Crime In DC Soaring? The Reason Is One Muriel Bowser,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Our town’s baseball team made national news this weekend — but it wasn’t for a win. Video, aired across the country, showed players and fans running for cover and diving into dugouts with their friends and families.

Gunshots, we quickly learned, had been fired outside, wounding three, including a fan. At that moment, they had echoed throughout the stadium and seemed to some to have come from inside.

As fans streaked out, a man in a sportscar took advantage of the situation, doing donuts in the middle of the busy intersection. Police were nowhere to be seen.

We need serious help down here. As if the shooting wasn’t enough, this idiot is doing doughnuts down in @TheYardsDC , with police mere blocks away. #anc6d07 #navyyard @DCPoliceDept @charlesallen pic.twitter.com/Y41h8OlsvZ — Edward Daniels (@EdwardDaniels) July 18, 2021

It was a national embarrassment for Mayor Muriel Bowser, the most progressive mayor in the District of Columbia’s history and, relatedly, the person who has overseen the total reversal of our hard-fought, declining crime rate.

The Nationals’ game was by far the most widely seen incident, but it was not remotely the saddest day of our city’s weekend. The night before, a shooting in a poor and largely black neighborhood just across the river, Congressional Heights, left a six-year-old girl dead. She’d been walking home with her parents and her older sister when people passing by in a car opened fire. When it was over, her mother lay wounded next to her daughter, along with three others.

Pictures posted by her family show a big, broad smile and braided hair just like her grandmother’s. It’s near impossible to hold back tears when you see her beautiful, innocent, young face.

Crime in this neighborhood has exploded as well. The overgrown and neglected park nearby was no longer a family-friendly place, and playing children had been replaced by drug users and other criminals. Pleas to the city to clean up the neighborhood had gone unheeded. The morning after the shooting, all that changed, and a local woman recorded truck after truck of city crews descending on the park to clean it up for the news cameras.

“So the city wants to act like they’re doing something when the cameras are about to come to the neighborhood?” she asked, narrating the video. “They have dump trucks, they have all the city people cleaning up the park. We’ve been asking for going to clean up this park this whole time and they want to send somebody now because the news is coming.”

I walked up to the site where the 6 year old was murdered and I saw the @USDOI @NationalMallNPS cleaning up the park ONLY because the Mayor and tv cameras are coming!!! @MayorBowser THIS IS ALL UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP!! Y’all! We need to hold them accountable!! Vote her out!!! pic.twitter.com/zzAyHxXEcu — Dougie Fresh ⚜️ (@IrshQtip) July 17, 2021

“Let [Bowser] do her press conference in the filth we live in everyday!!!” a local member of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission tweeted.

Just as in other Democratic cities across the country, violent crime in the nation’s capital is rising dramatically. The trends, worrisome to begin with, have accelerated as progressive voters and politicians have decriminalized drugs, abided public camping, done away with bail, closed public schools, and launched a concentrated attack on their own police officers.

The combination has thoroughly crushed cop morale, and today D.C. police complain of accelerated retirements and terrible recruiting leading to grueling overtime and undermanned shifts and patrols. One neighborhood police officer told us the city council had actually refused to open positions at the police academy.

And why would someone join the force right now? Why wouldn’t officers retire early? Ask nearly any cop you know from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and they’ll tell you don’t do it. “I told my son not to follow in my footsteps,” one longtime Cape Cod drug officer told me. “I couldn’t wait to retire.”

Meanwhile, the corporate media that worked to get these progressive politicians elected and then cheered their “police reforms” is completely perplexed. “Mayors,” The Washington Post claims, “see few options for regaining control.” Really?

That’s a lie, of course: It’s obvious how to regain control. There hasn’t been a spike in bad guys who own gun stores, as President Joe Biden claims, and bullets don’t fall from the sky anyway. There are causes, and one that adds to everything else going wrong is the refusal of politicians and woke U.S. attorneys to prosecute criminals.

This spring, for example, the city in its wisdom decided to empty a women’s shelter in Chinatown and replace it with a shelter for men. Obviously, crime increased dramatically while public sanitation plummeted. When the local community complained, police made arrests and order returned. But then a surprising advocate for criminals and public disorder hit the scene: U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Channing D. Phillips.

“At a local ANC meeting this past month, police representatives informed us that despite their success in arresting those who have been dealing hard narcotics to the homeless men at the shelter, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. is refusing to prosecute the cases for lack of resources/evidence,” Father Vincent De Rosa, a local Catholic priest and advocate for the poor, wrote to parishioners.

Further, it was suggested that lack of political will among our local D.C. leaders makes it impossible for the [D.C. police] to activate necessary resources to build stronger cases against the dealers with evidence that even the federal authorities cannot ignore. I hope you will prayerfully consider writing to the US Attorney’s Office for D.C., urging them the prosecute those who would prey on the weakest and most needy among us. Our city’s Herculean efforts to improve housing and reduce homelessness should not be hampered by the presence of narcotics among the homeless.

The story checks out. While riots rocked D.C. for the entirety of Donald Trump’s presidency, starting on his first day in office, hundreds and hundreds of violent participants were let go by prosecutors unwilling to do their duty.

Instead of prosecuting, this summer the mayor dedicated the public road in front of the White House — some of the most valuable and visible commercial real estate in the world — to Black Lives Matter, the organization responsible for much of the 2020 rioting. Unsurprisingly, businesses suffered as the square became a squalid home for garbage and drugs. Completely expectedly, order suffered as the square became a launching pad for riots against the White House and its guests.

Lafayette Park is not alone. Public homeless tent encampments are everywhere in D.C., filling our parks and making a mockery of our public green spaces. Union Station is overrun with junkies and violently insane people.

In D.C. today, women passing these camps have been especially targeted with harassment. It’s common now for our college-aged interns to report screams, swears, and projectiles hurled their way just outside their dorm — on a main thoroughfare of the city, mere blocks from the Capitol.

It’s not just drug addicts and rioters who escape prosecution. Earlier this month, three teenage girls tased a man in an attempted car-jacking. One of the girls was 12, one was 14 and one was 16. The police are only pursuing charges against the 12-year-old (who used the Taser) over the violent attack and invasion. The older girls, who almost undoubtedly put the child up to it and who took part in the crime, walked away.

They almost might as well have. Even when D.C. claims to “throw the book” at violent juvenile criminals, it’s a joke. When two teenage girls brutally murdered an elderly immigrant trying to feed his family, crushing his head against a pole while stealing the car he used for his livelihood (and showing more concern for their missing phone than the murdered man), they got “the maximum sentence.”

Want to know what that was? They’ll be released when they’re 21.

“Welcome to Washington, D.C. where violent crime permeates everything.” the city’s police union tweeted Sunday morning. “It is a tragedy that elected officials won’t let us do our jobs.”

In response, the city’s chapter of Black Lives Matter called the head of the union “a raging right wing extremist leading a campaign to fight for cops to keep brutalizing and killing black people and then blaming it those black people while being unable to stop the violence they fuel.”

And on July 12 — the same day the city and its prosecutor decided not to pursue charges against those 14 and 16-year-old car-jackers — Mayor Muriel Bowser went to the White House to ask the president for his help in solving violent crime in D.C.

Really? We’re to believe “mayors see few options for regaining control” of the cities they run?

Her voters might think differently.

DC Police Chief Goes Off On City Crime: Can't 'Coddle Violent Criminals’,"D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee slammed his community’s “unacceptable” violence during a lengthy impromptu speech on Friday, following two men being shot near restaurants on Thursday night in a popular area of northwest D.C.

Amid gunshots, diners had to flee their tables for safety, after which two shooting victims were taken to the hospital. Contee emphasized that such violence is becoming the norm in the nation’s capital.

The suspects and vehicle, described as an older black sedan, were captured by a nearby camera and can be seen in video here. pic.twitter.com/n8P2gR5ps9 — DC Police Department (@DCPoliceDept) July 23, 2021

“What happened out here last night …was unacceptable. It’s unacceptable in any community. The reality is, we have situations that happen like this … all across our city, and it’s been happening for a long time,” Contee said. “Last year, we had over 922 people shot in our city. Last year, 198 people [were] murdered in our city.”

“This should be shocking to the conscience of every person in our city,” Contee continued. “I don’t care where you live.”

108 murders in DC in the first six months of 2021, and they're almost all ignored. One shooting happens in an upscale NW DC neighborhood that CNN and HuffPost journalists love and it's a national news story. https://t.co/MT9nj51Swl — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) July 23, 2021

Contee noted that D.C.’s lawlessness began receiving extra attention after a Saturday baseball game at Nationals Park was violently interrupted by a shooting outside the stadium. Three people were wounded as fans cowered in the dugouts.

Contee condemned his city’s crime rate, saying communities have been suffering across D.C. for a long time. Not all crimes are high-profile, but Contee said they deserve attention too.

According to Contee, he and his colleagues keep recovering firearms, while criminals demonstrate a brazen disregard for the law. “We have a vicious cycle of bad actors who do things with no accountability and they end up back in [the] community … and I guarantee you, when we lock up whoever did this, they will be no stranger to us. I promise you that,” Contee noted.

He encouraged his neighbors to start reclaiming their city because “enough is enough.” In a long monologue, he made it clear he wants violent criminals to be held accountable:

“[T]he way that we’re going and the things that we’re trying to do, we want to help people, yes we should. But you cannot coddle violent criminals, you cannot. You cannot treat violent criminals who are out here making communities unsafe for you, for your loved ones, for me, for my loved ones. They might not want a job, they might not, they might not need services. What they may require is to be off of our streets because they’re making it unsafe for us. And if that’s what it requires, then that’s what it requires. And we have to own that. We have to own it, because if not, we see more of this. We see more of this in our communities and then what happens? When someone is shot … people are outraged by it. I’m outraged every time. …Those 922, a lot of those 198 [who] died … I stood over many of [the bodies].”

Contee went silent in thought. “[We need to] have honest conversations with the people, the leadership, be it the police chief, be it council members, be it courts, be it whoever,” he added. “The police department, we’re an easy target. You could easily focus on the police department, about what the police department did and didn’t do. That’s easy. I’m challenging you to look at the entire system.”

“The laws that are in place for people who carry guns in our community, who do things to people in [the] community, violent acts … are those things acceptable?” Contee asked. “Whatever you say is acceptable, it’s my responsibility to enforce that. That’s my job, to respond to those things that the community say[s] … is … the standard. … If some people knew what the standard is, what the outcome is on the other end of some of these cases, it would blow your mind.”

“The recidivism rate for violent offenders is the highest that we’ve seen anywhere — 87 percent, I think, in that area, for people who carry guns. They use them. I’m mad as hell about this, and I hope y’all are too,” Contee added. “Look at the system. How are we holding people accountable? What does that accountability look like, and is it okay with you?”

Contee’s comments come as crime continues to surge across America’s Democrat-run cities.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/24/dc-police-chief-unleashes-on-capitals-lawlessness-you-cannot-coddle-violent-criminals/,2021-07-24
"Former Sen. Barbara Boxer Assaulted, Robbed In Crime-Ridden Oakland","Amid an uptick in crime rates and a decision to defund the city’s police department by nearly $18 million, a former senator was assaulted and robbed in Oakland, California, according to a Twitter post on her account. The attack came an hour after police representatives said in a news conference they would take a hard stance against worsening crime.

Former California Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer, 80, was allegedly pushed in the back and had her cell phone snatched on Monday in the Jack London Square area of Oakland. The neighborhood is located about six miles from where the city’s professional baseball team plays, as reported by The Hill.

“Earlier today former Senator Barbara Boxer was assaulted in the Jack London Square neighborhood of Oakland,” the post reads. “The assailant pushed her in the back, stole her cell phone and jumped in a waiting car. She is thankful that she was not seriously injured.”

Oakland Police confirmed there was a robbery on the 300 block of 3rd Street at close to 1:15 p.m. but have not named Boxer directly yet. The police said the victim was “approached by a suspect” who “forcefully took loss from the victim, and fled in a nearby waiting vehicle.”

The Oakland Police Department’s robbery section is taking up the investigation, and authorities are offering up to $2,000 for any intel that would lead to an arrest. Oakland law enforcement said in the conference just prior to the assault that the city’s criminals are “ruthless” and “aggressive.”

In June, the City Council of Oakland voted to slash its police budget by nearly $18 million after the Biden administration sent the city $190 million in COVID-19 relief dollars. Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong recently indicated there has been a 90 percent increase in homicides, 88 percent increase in carjackings, and 70 percent increase in shootings in the last year.

“Without the resources, it makes it challenging to make Oakland safe, and more families find themselves dealing with trauma,” Armstrong said in a June press conference.

Armstrong organized a crime victims rally in early July that brought together hundreds of black families. Videos that circulated on social media, however, showed alleged Antifa members crashing the protest and clutching signs reading “F-ck OCP” and “Quit your job, kkkop!”

“We are seeing far too many people being arrested by our officers, going jail, and coming right back out and committing those same crimes in our community. There has to be some level of accountability,” Armstrong said on Monday.

Boxer announced in 2015 that she would not run for reelection. She was first elected to Congress in 1983.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/27/former-sen-barbara-boxer-assaulted-and-robbed-in-oakland-after-police-vow-to-crack-down-on-surging-crime/,2021-07-27
New York Is A Cautionary Tale About The Dangers of Progressivism,"Perhaps the best argument a conservative can make when defending his political views is to simply point to the failings of any blue state. By any metric, these states generally do poorly, which has led to residents in these states migrating to red states like Texas and Florida.

Seeing that no progressive leader campaigns on the promise to limit people’s freedoms, bankrupt the government, and fail to deliver basic social services, it’s not altogether clear why this seems to constantly happen when leftists are in charge. It has something to do with progressivism, sure, but it becomes necessary to delve into details for a comprehensive explanation.

Fortunately, Seth Barron gives this explanation with his new book, The Last Days of New York: A Reporter’s True Tale. With great detail and a wry sense of humor, he charts the downward course of New York City from a world-class city that could thrive even after suffering one of the worst terrorist acts in history to a dysfunctional concrete jungle that is quickly deteriorating into a crime-infested ghost town.

The protagonist of this story is Mayor Bill de Blasio, an embodiment of mediocrity and hypocrisy. Barron notes that “Bill de Blasio was flower, fruit, and fragrance” of New York’s progressive political culture.

He is the son of two Ivy League-educated parents, both with connections to elites in media and government, as well as the Communist Party. After his father committed suicide, de Blasio eventually changed his name from Warren Wilhelm to Bill de Blasio, his mother’s maiden name. He attended Greenwich college and then Columbia, earning a graduate degree in Latin American politics, which he put to use by working for a pro-Sandinista nonprofit organization and engaging in Marxist advocacy.

In 1994, de Blasio married the black one-time lesbian activist Chirlane McCray and had his honeymoon in Castro’s Cuba. They had two children who have also become activists. As Barron reports, the couple was “aggressive about using their children as props, highlighting Chiara’s depression and substance abuse in pushing McCray’s mental-wellness initiatives and Dante’s experiences as a young black man dealing with the police.”

In his professional life, de Blasio worked on various campaigns, was a consultant for a health-care workers union, and eventually was elected to the city council. After pandering to every constituency in the city, he was elected mayor and resumed his activist platform, promoting socialism, denouncing police, defending violent criminals and terrorists, combatting illusory racism—all while letting his city fall into neglect.

De Blasio’s Ascendency

The first thing to go upon de Blasio’s ascendency to the office of mayor was law and order. Right before this, the city was the model for urban law enforcement because of the broken-windows and hotspot policing of Rudy Giuliani and the continued resilience of Mike Bloomberg, who introduced stop, question, and frisk (SQF) to crack down on illegally owned firearms.

In line with his leftist ideals, de Blasio instead declared war on the police and dismantled the protections they enjoyed under previous administrations. He determined that strategies like SFQ and broken-windows policing were racist and let them fall into disuse or actively blocked them. He then hired on race-hustler Al Sharpton as a consultant for law enforcement while alienating his police force.

Sensing a tacit endorsement with the new mayor, anti-police protesters (pre-Black Lives Matter) took action and openly assaulted police during a march on Brooklyn Bridge in 2013. A few weeks later, two policemen were murdered in cold blood by a deranged man inspired by anti-police rhetoric. Adjusting to the new reality, police started holding back in their duties. De Blasio and the city council went even further by instituting the “Right to Know Act” which, as Barron explains, “makes basic police work impossible by forcing cops to act as impromptu legal aid interpreters for the suspects they are trying to investigate.”

As he undermined his police department, de Blasio took up the cause of illegal immigrants in his city. Even though previous administrations largely protected them, they apparently did wrong by cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to address aliens who also committed violent crimes. De Blasio ended this relationship, evidently preferring violent criminals living in his city illegally over their victims.

Barron draws a straight line between this decision and the horrific crime in which 21-year-old illegal immigrant Reeaz Khan raped and murdered 92-year-old Maria Fuertes. Predictably, de Blasio took no responsibility and blamed ICE, Donald Trump, and racism for the crime. This kind of attitude led to a series of decriminalization efforts that were meant to combat the supposed evils of xenophobia and racism, even as they effectively made New Yorkers less safe.

De Blasio paired decriminalization with bail reduction and decarceration. Barron notes these movements are nearly all based on simplistic narratives and partial truths.

For example, leftists will take a story like that of Kalief Browder, who committed suicide after serving three years in jail for stealing a backpack, who was too poor to post bail. Barron corrects this line by pointing out that Bowder did much more than steal a backpack (he assaulted and robbed a Mexican immigrant, violating his probation for stealing and crashing a bakery truck) and was thus ineligible for bail. He doesn’t give these details as proof that Browder should have suffered as he did, but to show how leftist leaders like de Blasio ignore facts that complicate their misleading narratives.

In a similarly obtuse fashion, de Blasio took on the city’s economic inequality, blithely asserting in his 2019 “state of the city” address, “Brothers and sisters, there’s plenty of money in the world. There’s plenty of money in this city. It’s just in the wrong hands.”

To rectify this, he blew out the city’s budget on paying off interest groups like the United Federation of Teachers, useless initiatives like “New York Works” and “Renewal Schools” programs, hiring more unionized city workers, and filing ridiculous lawsuits against all major oil producers. Despite this spending, the city’s businesses have fled the city, leaving its finances in a more precarious position than ever.

Moreover, as the city grew poorer and laxer with law enforcement, homelessness became a bigger problem. By now the pattern for de Blasio’s leftist “reforms” had become familiar: misjudge the problem and let it fester while spending tons of taxpayer money on useless programs. As such, to deal with the homelessness, de Blasio cited the lack of affordable housing as the culprit for homelessness and paid more than $1 billion for substandard homeless shelters and rehabilitation programs, all while refusing to address the vagrants and junkies harassing people in public parks and libraries.

In the following chapter, Barron shows how the same leftist logic played out with helping the mentally ill. De Blasio’s wife ran a series of initiatives under the banner “Thrive NYC,” emphasizing prevention, destigmatizing mental illness, and additional counseling. Predictably, the program was a bust since stigma against seeking treatment hardly exists and most people with mental illness require far more than counseling to function. As a result, thousands of mentally ill people continued to go untreated and posed a daily threat to other residents.

Meanwhile, New York’s youth continue to languish in inferior schools (that is, when lockdown don’t force them to languish at home) run by corrupt teacher unions and radical leftist district leaders, even as the city spends more than $25,000 per student each year. As usual, when called to account, those in charge blame racism and inequality.

De Blasio’s remedy was to provide universal pre-kindergarten, which ended up being funded by taxpayers across the state. His district superintendents Carmen Farina and Richard Carrazana remedied other problems by removing screening admission tests, ignoring testing data, and implementing critical race theory training for teachers.

The Cycle of Corruption

In his second to last chapter, Barron wraps up by discussing how New York City’s dysfunction originates from parasitic leftist organizations that perpetuate a cycle of corruption: “Much of the problem—unsurprisingly—lies in New York’s interlinked networks of donors, party bosses, unions, and consultants, who choose candidates, fund them, and essentially control them once they’re in office.” Barron does yeoman’s work connecting the many dots between so many groups, like the WFT, CONY, ACORN, AKPD, NWRO, and several more.

This corrupt web leaves little hope for new leadership to come clean up the mess. After all, incompetent activists and consultants are drafted into government positions, then use their authority to enrich the groups they left. They take businesses for granted because they’ve never worked for a business. They think government spending is the solution for everything because they themselves are the beneficiaries of government largess.

Even if an outsider sees de Blasio as a total failure of a mayor, there’s little reason to think that someone better will replace him. As Barron puts it, “If you are a city employee, he expanded your workforce, rewarded you with good contracts, and protected your job. If you run a political consultancy, he enriched you. If you work for an activist nonprofit organization, he supported you. If you are a hard-left activist or aspiring politician, he gave you a pivot to swing the city further left, because he didn’t.” Consequently, anyone who doesn’t do all these things and more will not win elections.

While Barron concedes that NYC is not quite a hellscape yet, it’s far from its former greatness. “All this may not amount to ‘anarchy’ in a purist’s sense of the word, but it isn’t the New York City that Bill de Blasio inherited either,” he writes. His book ends with a disturbing account of a man who aimed a crossbow at him while he was walking his dog. After discovering that the man had a long criminal history, Barron reported the incident and the police took the man in custody for a brief time before… releasing him.

Overall, The Last Days of New York is a valuable and fascinating case study on the effects of leftist leadership. Although frequently dispiriting, it upholds the analysis and predictions of those who resist the currents of leftism. It isn’t sustainable, it ushers in widespread corruption, and it’s destructive.

It’s a shame that the residents of America’s greatest city have to suffer from their poor selection of leaders. But it would be even more shameful the rest of the country fails to heed the lessons in Barron’s book and suffers the same fate as de Blasio’s New York.

"German Police Brawl With Anti-Lockdown Protesters, Amid Growing Opposition To COVID Mandates","Thousands of German civilians protested new government COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine passports across 13 separate demonstrations in Berlin on Sunday. Local authorities had banned such weekend protests, but countless Germans refused to be forced into silence and proceeded to demonstrate anyways, causing German authorities to deploy approximately 2,000 police officers onto Berlin’s streets in riot gear.

Over a year into lockdowns, Germany requires that individuals show vaccine passports, proof of recovery from COVID-19 or proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test, in order to dine indoors or book a hotel room, among other activities.

According to video footage obtained on Twitter, Berlin police officers brawled with anti-lockdown civilians, who have grown tired of tyrannical rules, throughout Berlin’s streets.

Police told the press that they were “harassed and attacked,” while protesters allegedly ignored roadblocks. Video footage shows both law enforcement and civilians initiating confrontations, which many establishment media outlets omitted.

Police detained protesters, but the crowds kept marching from Berlin’s Charlottenburg neighborhood toward Brandenburg Gate. Around 600 protesters were detained in total, while the police used irritants and batons to try to quell the crowds.

In one instance, a 49-year-old man collapsed and died, shortly after breaking through a street barrier. According to The Guardian, his cause of death is still unknown.

Is Germany Spying on Anti-Lockdown Groups?

Among other demonstrations, local authorities preemptively banned the Querdenker movement, the “most visible anti-lockdown movement in Germany,” according the Associated Press, from organizing a protest over the weekend. The movement has gathered thousands of Germans from across the political spectrum to challenge the government’s mandates. They view the government’s response to COVID as being fascistic and condemn vaccine mandates as a modern form of apartheid.

The German government sees the Querdenker movement as a threat to its power. Not only has Germany limited its citizens’ speech when it comes to protesting COVID-19 mandates, but the BBC recently reported that Germany’s domestic intelligence service is spying on members of the Querdenker movement, “amid concerns [that] they may be trying to delegitimize the state” and that their opinions could be dangerous to the status quo.

AP reports the movement includes “those opposing vaccinations, coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists.” However, the Querdenker movement’s founder, Michael Ballweg, vehemently rejects this portrayal of his group, arguing that “[he and his colleagues] are a peaceful movement and not a political party.”

Members of the German elite nonetheless find Ballweg’s movement threatening. Germany’s Parliament President Wolfgang Schäuble recently mouthed off about protesters, suggesting they should let the experts do all the thinking.

“If practically all experts worldwide say the coronavirus is dangerous and vaccination helps, then who actually has the right to say, ‘Actually, I’m smarter than that?’” Schäuble asked. “To me, that is an almost unbearable level of arrogance.”

Schäuble’s rhetoric does not appear to have put his people at ease, and more demonstrations in Germany are planned.

Global Opposition to COVID-19 Mandates

The German people aren’t the only ones to challenge their government’s COVID policies. For the third weekend in a row of protests, over 200,000 individuals gathered in France on Saturday to challenge their country’s vaccine mandates. The weekend prior, over 80,000 frustrated civilians similarly protested in Italy.

Such protests have persisted for weeks. As Federalist intern Shawn Fleetwood recently reported, civilians have challenged forced lockdowns and vaccine passports everywhere from Australia and France, to Italy and the United Kingdom.

Protesters in Sydney, Australia recently chanted “freedom,” while holding signs with quotations like “unmask the truth” and “no forced vaccines, no vax passports.” In France, tens of thousands of protesters gathered on July 24, with some of them shouting “Liberty! Liberty!” on Bastille plaza. Italian citizens recently gathered across Italy to protest the country’s vaccine passports, with many of them chanting “Freedom” and “Down with the dictatorship.”

One U.K. protester recently told Breitbart News that, “The vaccine passport system is the final straw, it’s the thin edge of the wedge. …Deaths have dropped, people are getting vaccinated, and in theory, that’s supposed to protect us, and here we still are.”

“I see no end to it, they are never going to let go of the powers that they have stolen, they are loving it too much,” she lamented.

The people of Slovakia, Ireland, and Greece, among others, have also pushed back strongly against vaccine passports.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/02/german-police-brawl-with-anti-lockdown-protesters-amid-growing-opposition-to-covid-mandates-across-europe/,2021-08-02
"Washington's New Laws Handcuffing Police Will Increase Crime, Chaos","Washington state just reimagined policing with sweeping so-called “police accountability” bills that went into effect this week. Led by anti-police activists enabled by allies in the Democrat-controlled legislature, the consequences of these dramatic changes will be worse than you can imagine. And Democrats don’t seem to care.

Police use of force is now strictly limited. Car chases and tear gas are almost entirely banned. Chokeholds are now forbidden, requiring officers to use more lethal tools at their disposal. Some bills even conflict with others.

“The challenge is — I’m going to be very frank — the laws were written very poorly, and the combination of them all at the same time has led to there being conflicts in clarity and in what was intended versus what was written,” Kent Police Chief Rafael Padilla told ABC News.

New Restrictions on Use of Force and Vehicle Pursuit

HB 1310 dictates only three scenarios where officers may use force. The most significant shift mandates officers can only use force when “probable cause” exists for an arrest.

Before the changes, “reasonable suspicion” was the standard. That is, police lack concrete evidence for an arrest but there is a reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain the suspect because officers think they committed a crime. The bar for probable cause is much higher because it requires some kind of concrete evidence (eyewitness affirmation, a confession, discovery of a warrant if the suspect gives his name, etc.).

The instances when police can use force are now to make an arrest, prevent an escape, or protect against an imminent threat of bodily injury to the peace officer, another person, or the person against whom force is being used.

HB 1054 severely restricts vehicle pursuits. Police cannot pursue suspects in vehicles unless there’s probable cause to believe that the suspect “committed or is committing a violent offense or sex offense.” That means if officers spot a car with a driver matching the description of a bank robbery suspect, they wouldn’t be able to pursue or make an arrest. There’s no probable cause yet.

That’s not all. The suspect must pose an imminent threat at the time, the pursuit must be necessary to apprehend the suspect, and the officer has to have a supervisor’s approval. Imagine checking off all those boxes before the suspect drives away and escapes.

Police Hesitate to Engage with the Mentally Ill

There have already been real-world consequences. In Chelan County, a man in a yellow dress who had just been discharged from a mental hospital allegedly stole a bus. Sheriff’s deputies made contact with the man, but he refused to pull over.

Police had reasonable suspicion that the man stole the bus, but that wouldn’t satisfy the higher bar for probable cause. So the deputies stopped their pursuit. Hours later, the man was accused of driving heavy construction equipment into the home of his estranged wife.

These new rules also affect the way police assist in mental health or drug crisis calls. Sometimes, officers have to use force during involuntary commitments that get people off the streets before they hurt themselves or others.

But probable cause wouldn’t exist for an arrest: running around partially naked and causing a scene isn’t a crime. And unless that person has a weapon in his hand, there’s no imminent threat.

This exact scenario occurred in the city of Sedro-Wooley. Officers responded to two calls within hours of each other but didn’t do anything because they interpreted the law to prohibit them from laying a hand on the man in crisis. They could only get involved after a suspect committed a crime or if the suspect acquired a weapon.

It’s easy to see why police chiefs and sheriffs are sounding the alarm. It’s why some have flatly said they will no longer respond to specific calls.

Ban on Other Weapons Makes Firearm Use More Likely

Not only do these laws make police officers’ jobs nearly impossible, they also make communities less safe. And residents have reasonable expectations that police will handle these incidents when they call 9-1-1 to report them.

Other new laws make the work of the police more dangerous. They will likely lead to more suspects being injured — the exact opposite of what Democrats said they intended.

HB 1054 prohibits police from using certain weapons. Democrats based their ban on caliber size, intending to stop police from using “military equipment” weapons that they didn’t even use. They defined the military equipment as “.50 caliber or greater.” By the letter of the law, this bans non-lethal bean bag guns, which would force officers to use more lethal tools like their firearms.

The bill’s sponsor claims the intent wasn’t to ban the non-lethal weapons and told ABC News that he expects the state’s attorney general to clarify the intent officially. Until then, given the anti-police sentiment in the legislature and leftist-controlled cities, officers are reticent to risk losing their certification in case it does contradict the new law.

In circumstances like a riot, a bean bag gun can come in handy. Police might also use tear gas to disperse violent crowds, but that has been seemingly banned too. Law enforcement agencies can still use tear gas to address a riot, barricaded subject, or a hostage situation. But before deploying this tool, they must first “exhaust alternatives to the use of tear gas that are available and appropriate under the circumstances.”

But during a riot outside of a prison – such as the one that occurred in downtown Seattle after the George Floyd death – officers must adhere to vague mandates like “whether the present circumstances warrant the use of tear gas” and allowing “sufficient time and space for the subject or subjects to comply with the officer’s or employee’s directives.”

In Seattle especially, activists want to ban the use of tear gas entirely, so they never deem circumstances warrant its use. And how do officers determine if sufficient time has passed before deploying the tear gas? Before or after a third building is ransacked or set ablaze?

More worrisome and controversial is that the law mandates agencies seek authorization from the highest elected official in the jurisdiction before using tear gas in these circumstances.

Depending on the agency and jurisdiction, that could mean a mayor, county executive, or governor – although not an elected sheriff or an appointed police chief, who actually have law enforcement expertise. In this scenario, you may end up seeking permission from a leftist official who supports the ban on the non-lethal tool. Without tear gas, officers just go into a riotous crowd with their lethal weapons. That puts everyone at risk.

Unclear Laws Won’t Be Clarified Soon

What’s worse, the laws reimagining policing are currently in effect. But the mandated model policy that would help clarify the intent of some of the laws isn’t due until mid-2022.

“There’s a lot of angst [from] an officer’s perspective in that we don’t have a model policy, and now we’re asked to go out and still do our best with trying to understand what the legislation is asking of us. And if we don’t do it right, we potentially could be decertified,” Seattle Police Interim Chief Adrian Diaz explained on my Seattle-based talk show on KTTH Radio.

All of these changes couldn’t have come at a worse time. Washington state saw a 47 percent rise in homicides last year, almost double the nationwide average.

Seattle is on pace to surpass 2020’s 26-year-high homicide rate record. Tacoma is seeing a similar surge. On the east side of the state, after a 186 percent increase in homicides last year, Spokane continues to see a spike in crime, with 12 drive-by shootings and 44 other shootings this calendar year through May.

Democrats Say Pushback Just Due to ‘Paradigm Shift’

With police statewide hamstrung, how do Democrats think this will end? They don’t seem to care. In a masterclass of gaslighting, the architect of these bills downplays issues, pretending the police were responsible for the violence.

“We have to create new policies because what we were doing before was not working,” Rep. Jesse Johnson (D-Federal Way) told ABC News. “What we wanted to do with these bills is set an expectation that officers de-escalate and that there’s less lethal enforcement of the law. A lot of the pushback we’re getting is because it’s a paradigm shift.”

The pushback they’re getting is because the laws make policing less effective and more dangerous for everyone involved.

Legislators didn’t think these changes through. They exploited the defund police movement that escalated after Floyd died in Minneapolis. They purposefully ignored law enforcement groups and lawmakers with police backgrounds as they warned of what their laws would mean.

Democrats’ goal was to dismantle and reimagine the police. And that’s exactly what they did. Now we wait for its deadly consequences.

"Cori Bush Justifies Her Private Security, Then Calls To Defund The Police","In a live interview with CBS News on Wednesday, Democrat Rep. Cori Bush justified her outrageously expensive private security and in the next breath said, “We need to defund the police.”

“I’m going to make sure I have security because I know I have had attempts on my life, and I have too much work to do. There are too many people that need help right now for me to allow that,” said Bush.

If she ends up spending $200,00o or $10 more dollars on security, it doesn’t matter, she said, because she “get[s] to be here to do the work, so suck it up.”

“And defunding the police has to happen,” were the next words out of Bush’s mouth. “We need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets.”

Bush came under fire last month after her campaign filings revealed she spent nearly $70,000 on private security over the past three months.

Federal Election Commission records show that between April 15 and June 28, her campaign sent $54,120.92 in payments for “security services” to New York-based firm RS&T Security Consulting.

Fox News reported that RS&T has “a mysterious online presence.” Its website is no longer active, “but a cached version of its now-defunct website shows that the group provides ‘executive protection agents’ that provide ‘first class executive protection and security for national and international figures.’”

Bush’s campaign paid an additional $15,000 to Nathaniel Davis for “security services” over the same time period. Oddly, Davis’s reported address in the filings is the same as Bush’s campaign headquarters.

The FEC records show that the $69,120 in security payments add up to more than a third of Bush’s $197,000 in campaign expenditures during the second quarter. They are also nearly double what her campaign spent on private security during the first quarter of 2021.

Her recent security payments are not the first she had made. During the first three months of the year, Bush’s committee paid $35,000 for security from RS&T, Davis, and Whole Armor Executive Protection, a Maryland-based firm.

Bush has also used taxpayer funds for her security. The Daily Caller reported in June that Bush’s congressional office had spent $880 on a day of protection with RS&T as the firm was simultaneously collecting checks from her campaign.

Bush is not the only member of “the squad” to pay for a private security detail, but hers is by far the most expensive. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York spent just over $4,000, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota paid $2,800, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts dished out $3,500 for protection. All of the women have concurrently been advocating to defund the police.

As Bush said Wednesday, she and her socialist pals in the squad are pushing to drastically cut local police budgets and allocate money instead to social programs. In the cities where police budgets were cut in response to massive Black Lives Matter protests, however, crime has skyrocketed and communities have become less safe.

As cities like San Francisco and Portland have devolved into chaos and utter lawlessness, the popularity of the “defund the police” movement has plummeted. In San Francisco, about 76 percent of surveyed citizens said they want more police presence in high-crime neighborhoods. A different poll similarly found that the majority of Portland residents reject the “defund the police” movement.

The results of Bush’s “defund the police” policies have only harmed the very communities she claims to be helping. But while she seeks to strip law enforcers out of vulnerable communities, she ramps up protection for herself. The message is clear: safety for me but not for thee.

Video From Fairfax Public Schools: ‘I Feel Safe When There Are No Police’,"A summer “Learning Guide” published by Fairfax County Public Schools in Northern Virginia is teaching anti-police rhetoric to second graders. According to a whistleblower’s copy published by Parents Defending Education, this year’s guide promotes a video from “Woke Kindergarten” that claims, “I feel safe when there are no police.”

Under a list of “suggested texts,” the six-page document recommends YouTube videos by Ki, the creator of “Woke Kindergarten.” The first “suggested” video is entitled “Safe by Ki (Woke Kindergarten 60 second text).” It starts by saying, “We all deserve to feel safe.” However, the video quickly becomes political.

“I feel safe when I’m with my dogs. I feel safe when I’m with my partner. I feel safe when I’m with my friends. I feel safe when people listen to my feelings. I feel safe when there are no police,” the video says. It attempts to normalize anti-police rhetoric, by telling impressionable young children that it’s just as reasonable to feel safe around dogs as it is to feel “unsafe” around police.

“It’s no one’s job to tell me how I feel,” the video concludes. “But it’s everyone’s job to make sure that people who are being treated unfairly feel safe too.”

As the narrator speaks, the video shows young protesters holding signs that say, “Racism Isn’t Born, It’s Taught” and “Black Lives Matter,” a reference to the leftist organization connected to rioters who attacked and destroyed businesses across America last summer.

Fairfax County Public Schools’ summer learning guide also suggests a second video, called “Good Trouble by Ki (Woke Kindergarten 60 second text).” This video tells young children, “Sometimes it’s good to get into trouble. It’s good when you are protecting your friends. It’s good when you are showing that you care about people’s lives.”

It also displays an image of anti-gun rights “March For Our Lives” protestors, implying that it’s okay for kids to break the law if they’re supporting left-wing movements. The video invokes the legacy of civil rights leader John Lewis, in an attempt to suggest that the civil rights movement of the 1960s is analogous to today’s left-wing politicking.

“…Necessary change has to happen, in order for Black and Indigenous people to be free. Which is why [John Lewis] kept getting into good trouble, until he couldn’t anymore,” the video claims. “Now it’s our turn. We can get into good trouble.”

Parents Defending Education points out, “Some critics have noted that the concept of ‘good trouble’ is confusing for second graders as they are also being taught, ‘I feel safe when there are no police.’” Not only are second graders being taught that law enforcement is evil, but they’re also being implicitly encouraged to break the law.

According to Woke Kindergarten’s own website, pushing leftism is exactly the point of these videos. Woke Kindergarten creator Ki self-describes as an ardent radical. “Ki (they/them) is an abolitionist early educator, coach, consultant and creative entrepreneur currently innovating ways to unlearn, heal, liberate and create with their pedagogy, Woke Kindergarten,” Ki’s bio says. The website also touts a “commitment to abolitionist early education and pro-Black liberation.”

The language of “abolitionist” suggests Woke Kindergarten is dedicated to eradicating America’s law enforcement. The site’s “Woke Wonderings” page displays a series of infographics, which gear anti-police rhetoric toward children.

“If we abolished the police, what else could we do to keep people in the world safe?” one image asks, unintentionally acknowledging that police do, indeed, keep people safe. “Abolish means to get rid of for good,” another image says. “When we abolish something, we stop it from existing.”

Woke Kindergarten also publishes “Woke Read Alouds” for small children, as well as “woke words” of the day like “protest” and “abolish.”

This is the organization whose materials are being recommended to Virginia children. Parents are sending their tax dollars — and more importantly, their children — to Fairfax County Public Schools, whose summer reading materials encourage students to defy the law and fear those who serve in blue. And this is just the latest, as critical race theory persists in American schools.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/06/fairfax-public-schools-suggested-video-i-feel-safe-when-there-are-no-police/,2021-08-06
Will Defund The Police Lead To Federal Patrols In Big Cities?,"Violent crime is mounting in America. Many reasons—excuses, mostly—have been proffered for this: COVID-19 lockdowns, unemployment, the Defund the Police movement and its budgetary fruits, largely tolerated urban looting and rioting, police reluctance to enforce the law in high-crime areas for fear of being accused of civil rights violations, and soft-on-crime leftist prosecutors.

The ramifications of this rise in crime are being felt largely by the urban poor and may yet generate political fallout for the largely leftist elite who run most of America’s major cities today. Let’s examine the conditions giving rise to that possibility.

Crime in America

First, some background on crime in America. The FBI reports crime in two major buckets: violent crime and property crime. Violent crimes involve force or threat of force, including murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Property crimes are defined as burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson—with no force or threat of force against the victims.

The violent crime rate peaked in 1992 at 758 crimes per 100,000 people. It moved down fairly consistently until 2014, when the violent crime rate bottomed out at 362, less than half of the level of violent crime 22 years earlier. Violent crime crept back up to 387 in 2016, and then moved down for the first three years of the Trump presidency to 367 in 2019. Final 2020 numbers have not been released.

The most recent violent crime victimization surveys indicate that for every 1,000 people aged 12 and older, there were 21.0 reported violent crimes in 2019. By race and ethnicity, this broke down to a rate of 21.0 for non-Hispanic whites, 18.7 for non-Hispanic blacks, 21.3 for Hispanics, and 7.5 for Asian, and 66.3 for other (Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and persons of two or more races).

Property crimes are sometimes referred to as quality-of-life crimes. In 1992, the national property crime rate was 4,904 offenses per 100,000 people. By 2019, the property crime rate had declined to 2,110.

Property crime victimization reports show that property crime was 125 percent more common in urban areas than in rural areas, with suburban areas in between. The reported rates per 1,000 households were 153.0 per 1,000 in urban areas, 110.8 in suburban areas, and 68.1 in rural areas in 2019. Property crimes have a disproportionate effect on the poor in urban areas, preventing the accumulation of capital and discouraging job-creating investment. Wealthy urbanites can pay for their own security measures or move out of high-crime areas.

Some Basic Statistics About Policing and Crime

As of 2019, there were 1,003,270 full-time law enforcement employees in America, according to the FBI, of whom almost 700,000 were sworn officers. There are wide variations in policing nationwide due to population density, tradition, and need, with the Middle Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) having the highest per capita level of law enforcement, 4.0 employees per 1,000 residents, almost double that of the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) at 2.1 employees per 1,000 residents.

One might presume there are more law enforcement personnel in high-crime cities, but there is little correlation. Some cities have high crime rates and robust law enforcement numbers, and some have high crime rates and a thin blue line.

For instance, Kansas City, Missouri, the U.S. murder rate capital., employs 3.7 law enforcement personnel per 1,000 residents. In 2019, there were 1,431 violent crimes reported per 100,000 people in Kansas City while the property crime rate was 3,856. This compares to the national average of 3.5 law enforcement personnel per 1,000 people with a national violent crime rate of 367 per 100,000 people and a property crime rate of 2,110.

The table below highlights some cities that were in the news during much of 2020 for protests, riots, looting, and arson. It compares them to other major cities that largely escaped significant unrest, comparing their levels of law enforcement, violent crime, property crime, and the ratio of law enforcement to those crimes, essentially providing a measure of the number of crimes committed per law enforcement personnel.

Of note, three of the cities noted for persistent and damaging unrest—Minneapolis, Portland, and Seattle—had a volatile combination of law enforcement staffing levels far below the national average paired with property crime rates more than double the national average—in 2019, a year before widespread unrest broke out.

Thus, from a practical standpoint, Minneapolis, Portland, and Seattle had already defunded the police by 2019. That all three cities were constantly in the news throughout 2020 makes more sense when understanding that, from a policing standpoint, local political leaders had already surrendered to lawlessness.

In Seattle’s case, it should be completely unsurprising that the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) later known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) would fester in a city that had police staffing levels at 70 percent of the national average. Portland, the site of the persistent Antifa siege of a federal courthouse and other government buildings, employed half of the national average of law enforcement personnel, while seeing the highest ratio of property crimes per law enforcement staff of the 13 cities examined.

How many police there are, how they are trained, equipped, and deployed, and the level of trust they enjoy with the public largely drives law enforcement’s ability to solve crimes. This is known as the crime clearance rate.

Of the violent crimes known by law enforcement, only 45.5 percent were cleared by arrest of a suspect in 2019, with 61.4 percent of murders resulting in an arrest. The closure rate for property crime that year was a dismal 17.2 percent nationally, meaning if you had your stuff stolen, there was about a one-in-six chance police might arrest the perpetrator. In cities of 1 million or more, the odds of seeing justice for stolen goods drops to 11.6 percent, or about one-in-nine.

What Happens Next?

With police increasingly seeing their profession under assault while politicians seek to appease protesters, law enforcement retirements and resignations have surged. From April 2020 to March of this year, retirements increased 45 percent from the prior 12-month period with resignations up 18 percent. Hence, even if some cities wanted to maintain or increase their police force, they may have to find even greater numbers of new recruits to make up for the loss of veteran officers.

Mayors and city council members in urban areas beset with rising crime and unrest may take three possible paths. They can ask for outside assistance—such as federal law enforcement or National Guard soldiers—to supplant overtasked police departments. They can double down on defunding the police. Or they can reverse course, whether voluntarily or by being thrown out of office and their replacements changing policy.

Baltimore, Maryland offers an example of asking for outside help. Baltimore suffers from a violent crime rate some five times the national average. Its leaders are now calling for federal help to make up for their faulty management. Baltimore police announced in late July they would ask for 100 federal agents to make up for a police department that is short 392 officers, 14 detectives, and another almost 200 support staff. In 2019, the city employed 2,940 law enforcement personnel.

Exactly one year earlier, Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby penned an op-ed for the Washington Post in which she warned President Trump she would prosecute any “militarized federal agents (sent) to Baltimore City to attack our citizens by making illegal arrests, kidnapping people, (or) assaulting them…” What a difference a year makes. Mosby and her husband are now under a federal criminal investigation for financial wrongdoing, having bought two homes in Florida since last September for more than $1 million.

Portland offers a cautionary tale on doubling down. Last summer, its city council cut $15 million from the police department while zeroing out the gun-violence team’s 38 positions. Murders are now on track to exceed the city’s record high of 70 killings set in 1987. The city now wants to bring back the gun-violence squad, but only four police officers have applied to work on the new 14-member team whose required qualifications include the ability to fight systemic racism. In the meantime, mostly minority Portlanders are being killed.

Lessons from the Los Angeles Riots

The city of Los Angeles in the wake of the 1992 L.A. riots offers the most dramatic example of a city changing course, although perhaps the events of 1992 during the height of America’s crime wave are of a different nature than today’s challenges. Due in equal parts to the advent of social media and the fading of time, however, most Americans likely think 2020’s unrest was far worse than what occurred over six days in Los Angeles in April and May of 1992.

In summer 2000, more than 62,000 National Guard members were deployed in response to unrest in more than 30 states and 200 cities, including Washington, D.C. Property damage in the first two weeks of violence starting May 26 totaled $1 to $2 billion in insured losses with some 14,000 arrested by the end of June.

By comparison, the 1992 L.A. riots saw 12,111 arrests with $1.8 billion of property damage in inflation-adjusted dollars. In addition, 10,000 National Guard troops were deployed to help restore order, with an additional 3,500 active-duty forces brought into the L.A. area. In other words, the six days of violence and destruction in Los Angeles in 1992 was about equal to the paroxysms of rioting, looting, and arson over the two most intense weeks nationwide in 2020.

So, what happened in L.A.? In 1992, Los Angeles suffered its worst year of violent crime. There were calls to reform the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)—and to significantly increase its numbers.

A year after the riots, Los Angeles elected its first Republican mayor in 32 years with Richard Riordan calling to increase the LAPD by 40 percent over five years. While the Democratic supermajority on the city council resisted Riordan’s efforts to expand the LAPD, the force did in fact grow from 7,600 in 1993 to 12,954 in 2019, an increase of 70 percent, while the city’s population expanded by only 12 percent over the same period. This increased the force patrolling the city from about 2.2 law enforcement personnel per 1,000 people in 1993 to 3.2 per 1,000 in 2019.

New York City’s recent mayoral primary offers hope that voters may turn things around themselves. Eric Adams, a former police captain, narrowly won the Democratic nomination for mayor while voicing opposition to defunding the police. Running as a centrist, Adams beat out New York Times-endorsed Kathryn Garcia, Maya Wiley, the Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-approved candidate, Andrew Yang, and others.

Adams faces Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, in the general election in November. Adams’s victory will continue New York City’s traditional robust financing of a police department with a per capita staffing level 80 percent above the national average. The violent crime rate in New York was 56 percent higher than the national average, but still far below most major cities.

The Defund the Police movement will inevitably collide with the reality of rising crime in elections through 2022. Results at the local level will be uneven. Nationally, however, Democrats who don’t unequivocally support law enforcement will face strong electoral headwinds from voters of every race and ethnicity who prize their own safety above rhetoric.

Lori Lightfoot Whines About Frustrated Chicago Police Officers And Tough Press Questions,"Chicago Police Officer Ella French was murdered during a traffic stop Saturday night, and one of her colleagues remains in critical condition. As Americans pray for Chicago police officers and their families, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot remains focused on herself. In her Wednesday press conference about French’s death, Lightfoot complained to reporters, alleging that their critical reporting on her leadership has been “sickening.”

Over two dozen police officers turned their backs on Lightfoot late Saturday night, when she visited the University of Chicago Medical Center, where French’s partner is still in critical condition.

When Lightfoot was asked to comment on the officers’ protest, she whined that “we are living in a time where people don’t respect each other.” Lightfoot seemingly suggested to reporters that the police officers’ protest was similar to “nasty, vicious” internet talk. “So this is a larger question than what may have happened with 10 or 15 officers on Saturday night,” Lightfoot said. “It’s why do we think it is OK for people to engage in such nasty, vicious talk, orally or worse, on social media, and then have it repeated by media as if it is fact and true.”

Lightfoot continued her posturing, saying, “I think our media plays a very important role in our democracy, but you lose me, you lose me when it’s a race to the bottom and it’s all about the fight and it’s all about the conflict,” she said. “I’ve got to tell you, some of the reporting I’ve seen this week is just sickening. We all need to ask ourselves what we can do better to show our people everywhere that we have the capacity to be human beings again.”

While Lightfoot clouded her argument in platitudes, her message was clear: she does not take nicely to being criticized. Allegations have been made that First Deputy Police Superintendent Eric Carter called off the traditional honor guard and bagpipe salute during French’s funeral procession. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Carter told police officers, “We’re not waiting on the bagpipes,” because “we don’t have 20 minutes for this sh-t.”

Lightfoot “reportedly backed Carter’s decision [to rush the procession,] after initially insisting during a news conference that the reports about Carter were false,” Fox News reports. And her narrative keeps shifting.

During Wednesday’s press conference, Lightfoot tried to argue that the reporting on Carter “is just not true”and that “Eric Carter made the right call,” but she conceded that the procession did not follow tradition.

“I support what he did,” Lightfoot said. “And I’m terrified that in this moment, people are trying to savage him for whatever agenda or purpose.” “And I would just caution you all. Be careful. Be careful,” she preached. “Check your sources. Make sure they’re accurate. Get the right context. Because I know firsthand, it’s really hard when the media becomes ferocious in propagating a story that’s just not true.”

In an attempt to explain Carter’s actions, Fox News reports Lightfoot “cited ‘COVID protocols’ by the Medical Examiner’s Office and claimed a protest group that ‘wanted to hijack the procession’ complicated matters outside of the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.”

Lightfoot happily attended Lollapalooza just a couple of weeks ago, but argued that Chicago city leadership couldn’t honor French with a traditional send-off, due to virus concerns. This explanation is complicated by the fact that a representative for the Medical Examiner’s Office told WGN News that “Protocols for [such] processions … have not changed since the pandemic began.”

At least 75 Chicagoans were shot over the weekend, including 9 murdered and 16 wounded in three mass shootings. The weekend prior, 51 Chicagoans were shot, at least six of whom died.

As of August 10, total homicide victimizations, total shooting victimizations, criminal sexual assault victimizations, vehicular hijacking victimizations, and aggravated assault victimizations are all on the rise in Chicago, compared to last year. Lightfoot nonetheless tried to brag earlier this summer that Chicago “crime is on the decline.” This wasn’t true then and it isn’t true now. Chicago’s crime is surging.

Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Carter stated Officer French’s name wrong. It was Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown who got the name wrong, not Carter.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/12/after-chicago-police-officer-was-slain-lori-lightfoot-whines-about-frustrated-officers-and-tough-press-questions/,2021-08-12
Breaking: Man In Capitol Hill Bomb Threat Surrenders To Police,"WASHINGTON D.C. — Capitol Police say they have taken into custody “without incident” the man threatening to detonate a bomb from his pickup truck on Capitol Hill.

Police responded Thursday afternoon to a bomb threat on Capitol Hill, where a man in a pickup truck claimed the vehicle would detonate if law enforcement shoots through his windows. Congress is on recess, although buildings in and around the Capitol complex have been evacuated.

According to Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, the man, identified as Ray Roseberry, drove onto the sidewalk outside the Library of Congress around 9:15 a.m., telling an officer he had a bomb. The officer believed Roseberry to be holding a detonator.

In a press conference around 12:00 p.m. ET, Manger said “negotiations [were] ongoing.” According to reports, Roseberry was communicating with police by writing notes and shouting from the truck.

Federalist Editor Christopher Bedford reported from the scene, posting pictures and videos from outside the police perimeter. “Police down the line seem calm,” Bedford wrote.

Roseberry appeared to be posting long live-streams to Facebook as the morning unfolded. A Facebook profile under the man’s name included several of these streams throughout the morning, matching the description of the event and revealing potential motivations. The profile was later removed by Facebook.

“If you wanna shoot me, and take the chance of blowing up two and a half city blocks … cause that toolbox is full [of] ammonium nitrate,” Roseberry said in one of the videos.

In the streams, Roseberry spoke directly to President Joe Biden, repeatedly urging him not to shoot through the glass of the truck because it would detonate the explosion, which he also claimed he had no control over. “The revolution’s on,” he said at one point, later claiming the revolution would begin if law enforcement detonated the explosion by shooting at the truck.

Roseberry’s streams revealed an unclear political motivation, with the man saying at one point he “loved” Nancy Pelosi. He also repeatedly criticized Democrats. “I don’t care if Donald Trump ever becomes President again. It doesn’t matter to me,” Roseberry argued, saying at another point, “Black, white, lesbian, LGBT, it don’t matter, we’re Americans.”

What's After The Vicious Murder Of Chicago Police Officer Ella French?,"You can just tell from the photos that she was kind. As a police officer on Chicago’s South Side, Ella French witnessed more than her fair share of violence. But in every photo, she smiles like someone who refuses to be corrupted or beaten down by evil. It’s not a naive smile, but a forgiving one—the kind that acknowledges the flaws of others, but chooses to remain hopeful in them and our world.

At 29 years old, French gave everything she had to her neighbors and her city. Just this July, she played a prominent role in saving the life of a one-month-old baby, during a South Side mass shooting.

A month later, French was the one in need of saving. She willingly ventured into the night as a member of the Chicago Police Department’s Community Safety Team, which was “designed to forge stronger ties with people on the South Side and the West Side.” On the night of August 7, she didn’t come home.

French and her partner were gunned down on Chicago’s South Side during a routine traffic stop. She died shortly afterward, and her partner remains in critical condition. Officer Carlos Yanez is paralyzed with a bullet lodged in his brain, with additional wounds from gunshots to the eye and shoulder. His wife and almost three-year-old son are among countless Americans fervently hoping he recovers.

Rest In Peace, Officer Ella French. pic.twitter.com/5SISJIgIR5 — The Chicago Thinker (@ThinkerChicago) August 16, 2021

Chicago Police Officer Carlos Yanez, Jr, continues to fight his way back from three gunshot wounds that left him critically wounded and his partner, Officer Ella French, dead on August 7. https://t.co/kZLbdlemWM #ChiUnreported #Chicago — Ms. Carmen Pearson (@MsCarmen_PVPR) August 18, 2021

Meanwhile, French’s family is reckoning with the sudden, senseless loss of their loved one. “I wake up every morning, and I start crying because my day doesn‘t have my daughter anymore,” French’s mother told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The few times I’ve turned on the TV, it distresses me to see her picture and her name with the word ‘killed.’ It’s just so hard.” She never thought she’d bury her daughter. But, on Thursday, she did just that.

As thousands gathered at French’s funeral, their message of solidarity was clear: America cannot tolerate such senseless slaughter.

It’s time to vocalize that blue lives matter. Civilian lives matter. All lives matter. In the coming days and months, this message should be the rallying cry of all Americans. We cannot tolerate a lawless regime that encourages its people to be gunned down in the streets.

Crime is surging across our country. If our “leaders” won’t do the work to support our police officers so that they can impose law and order and live to tell about it, then the American people must hold its failed leaders accountable. We must demand, and work toward, better.

Chicago Is A Disaster And So Is Its Leadership

Unsurprisingly, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her colleagues responded to French’s slaughter with characteristic ineptitude. Their lousy leadership merits elaboration, because it’s indicative of just how poorly our “leaders” often respond to the people’s suffering.

After French was slain, Lightfoot had the nerve to whine about negative press coverage. As she made clear in her heated response to a reporter, she does not tolerate criticism, and last week was a particularly bad press week for her. Meanwhile, Lightfoot and Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown haven’t even focused on French long enough to consistently get her name right.

It gets worse. When it came time for the traditional honor guard and bagpipe salute to honor French’s life, First Deputy Police Superintendent Eric Carter reportedly canceled it. “We’re not waiting on the bagpipes,” he allegedly announced. “We don’t have 20 minutes for this sh-t.”

Lightfoot tried to defend Carter’s decision, by sharing the disputed claim that the procession had to be rushed due to “COVID concerns,” among other excuses. The message to Chicagoans was clear: Lightfoot can celebrate at Lollapalooza all she wants, but when a young woman is gunned down in uniform, COVID theater comes back into effect.

As of August 17, total homicides, total shootings, criminal sexual assault, vehicular hijackings, and aggravated assault are all surging in Lightfoot’s city. In this climate of inexcusable lawlessness, two felons have been identified and charged in the attack on French and Yanez, one of whom was already facing charges in connection with a hit-and-run four months ago.

To make matters even more despicable, 7-year-old Serenity Broughton was shot to death on Chicago’s Northwest Side on Sunday, while her 6-year-old sister is recovering from her own gunshot wound. The killer appears to be on the run. Last I checked, Black Lives Matter was silent about this.

None of this is surprising. Welcome to Lori Lightfoot’s Chicago.

Ella French Was Murdered In Cold Blood, And Our Cities Aren’t Burning

Clearly, America’s urban centers are devolving into epicenters of violence and bloodshed right before our eyes. But if you’re patting yourself on the back right now because you escaped America’s skyscrapers and urban slums, stop.

Our cities are “Exhibit A” in the leftist machine’s willful neglect of Americans’ suffering, but they’re just that: evidence of a much larger problem. The same elitist mentality that dismissed Donald Trump supporters as “deplorable,” “stinky Walmart shoppers” applies to any American who doesn’t fit the left’s narrative.

French was slain in cold blood, but virtue-signaling celebrities don’t post en masse in her honor. Corporate behemoths and SJW’s don’t rush to perform their “empathy.” Americans don’t march from coast to coast.

The leftist machine knows how to manufacture outrage, but it has no real concern for the little guy. When violent BLM rioters terrorized businesses and burned Americans’ life savings last summer, the media’s talking heads made excuses for the lawbreakers. And when the New York Post reported that BLM co-founder (and self-described Marxist) Patrisse Khan-Cullors had gone on a multi-million-dollar real estate shopping spree, Big Tech censored the story.

As the machine shapes the narrative and disregards huge swaths of American suffering, crime soars. Democrat mayors enjoy their own security, but they defund local police forces. They claim benefits they want to deny from you.

If you don’t believe me, just watch U.S. Rep. Cori Bush attempt to justify her own private security, while calling to take away your protection. She and her leftist colleagues live by the motto “safety for me, but not for thee.” They want to live in a regime that treats them as special. Don’t let them.

It’s Time For Americans To Stand Up Against The Machine

If you point out the leftist machine’s corrupt tactics, you’ll be slandered as a racist, despicable human being. As Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech recently said, “Americans who reject the woke and show they are wide awake are denounced by nattering elites and their media handmaidens as extremist, as dangerous, and — this is rich — as white supremacists. It’s a lie and no one believes it. Not even them.” So, stop playing by the machine’s rules. Stop capitulating to their lies and selling yourself out in the process.

As Chicago’s police officers mourned the loss of their colleague and friend, they turned their backs on Lightfoot. In one defiant gesture, they collectively communicated what so many of us have been thinking for so long. Many of our “leaders” turned their backs on all of us long ago. So turn your backs on them.

“Turning their backs on [@chicagosmayor] was an excellent example of how the hundreds of police officers felt waiting outside the hospital,” Catanzara said. “Officers no longer support Lightfoot’s leadership.” Read the entire @Suntimes story below ⬇️:https://t.co/ojuTA7iSyT — Fraternal Order of Police – Chicago Lodge #7 (@FOP7Chicago) August 9, 2021

Stop voting for corrupt politicians who destroy our country. Primary and vote the swamp creatures out of office. And in the meantime, thank your local police officers for their heroism, buy them coffee, and pray they return home safely at night.

Following the shooting of Officers French and Yanez, Chicagoans held “Support The Police Prayer Rallies” to honor the city’s police officers. Go to events like that. And if they’re not already scheduled in your area, organize one yourself. Get to know your neighbors, work together, and demand better of yourself and your community.

I’m not so naive as to believe in utopia. Evildoers will always enact heinous crimes, and there’s no perfect solution to make that stop. But there are better and worse responses to such evil. Clearly, Lightfoot isn’t capable of true leadership, and neither are her colleagues. They won’t hold themselves accountable, so the American people must.

The machine’s elites are powerful, but so are hard-working Americans. Remind them of that. And keep saying the names of our fallen heroes.

DOJ Shuts Down Investigation Into Capitol Police Shooting Of Ashli Babbitt,"Months after the Department of Justice (DOJ) opted not to charge the unnamed U.S. Capitol Police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt on Jan. 6, a memo obtained by NBC News indicates the investigation will be fully closed.

Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was shot by the “service pistol” of an officer during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She was trying to climb through a smashed glass door near the Speaker’s lobby. After receiving assistance from a Capitol Police emergency response team, Babbitt died at Washington Hospital Center.

The memo, written by the commander of the Capitol Police’s Office of Personal Responsibility, states that “no further action will be taken in this matter,” according to NBC. The information comes on the heels of the DOJ announcing in April that it would not levy charges against the officer.

“Specifically, the investigation revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber,” the department said in a press release at the time.

Shortly after the DOJ’s decision in April, Babbitt’s family unveiled a $10 million lawsuit against the Capitol police. The suit was filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which permits compensation in the case of “a personal injury or death, caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of a Government employee while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.”

Two weeks ago, Babbitt’s mother criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein for never getting back to her after reaching out. Babbitt served in the Middle East from 2004 to 2016 on multiple tours.

"One Year After Riots, Kenosha, Wisconsin Is Still Picking Up The Pieces","One year ago today, Kenosha police responding to a domestic complaint shot 29-year-old Jacob Blake seven times in the back, leaving him partially paralyzed. A warrant had been issued for Blake’s arrest in July 2020 on charges of third-degree sexual assault, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct. At the time of the shooting, Blake appeared to be armed with a knife, struggled with officers, thwarted two Tasers, disregarded police commands, and was getting inside a vehicle with three children.

The shooting was a justified use of force to ensure the safety of the officers and the children in the vehicle. No officers involved, including the officer who shot Blake, were charged. Nonetheless, Democrat politicians and their allies in corporate media seized on footage of the shooting, declaring it yet another act of “racism” and proof of America’s systemic oppression.

The results of this rhetoric included two deaths and lasting trauma in a middle-income midwestern city after ensuing riots that caused $50 million in property damage. The damage affected 100 businesses, including putting 40 “out-of-business for good,” according to a member of the Kenosha County Board.

This week, when the corporate media publishes reflection pieces to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Kenosha riots, keep in mind that their goal is to rewrite history and exonerate the politicians and race hucksters responsible for the violence. The true story of Kenosha matters — not just for the residents of Kenosha who lived through it, but also for the rest of the country.

Lasting Scars

Republican Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents Kenosha in Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District, says that while Kenoshans have proven resilient, “there’s still scars.”

The physical imprint left on the city is still clearly visible today. Uptown Kenosha, where the brunt of arson and looting occurred, appears dilapidated and empty a year after the riots. There is a massive gaping lot and still bits of rubble where the 110-year-old Danish Brotherhood and 109-year-old Rode’s Camera Shop once stood. The bricks are still charred in buildings across the street.

“They weren’t just buildings,” says Kimberly Warner, a single mom who owns two businesses in downtown Kenosha, “but history.”

A year after the rioting, there are still boards covering windows across uptown and downtown Kenosha. Many display artwork preserved from the “Love is the Answer” movement, an attempt by community members to paint positive pictures and messages in the wake of the deadly riots. Other signs are less uplifting. One sign downtown still reads “please kids above,” with an arrow pointing to second-floor apartments.

Even those who didn’t see their businesses looted or burnt down are still affected today. “Several other business owners I know and several officers that I know are suffering from PTSD from seeing some of the things that we saw,” says Warner, her voice breaking. “I sometimes don’t want to close my eyes at night, because it all comes back.”

Mark Wistar, owner of The House of Nutrition and Wellness in downtown Kenosha, tells The Federalist that, like any other business owners, he and his shop were majorly affected by COVID-19 closures. When the rioting came, many businesses in Kenosha were already struggling, and the damage put them over the edge. While many have recovered, others will never reopen.

Wistar, who used to be on Kenosha’s tourism board, says the city “really depends on tourism.” The rioting gave the town “a bad name,” he explains. Because the media “publicized it everywhere,” even businesses that were not physically damaged continue to suffer from the stigma.

The plywood boards still covering shop windows point to the lasting trauma for business owners, but they have also sparked frustration among others. Many business owners expressed to The Federalist that the boards make Kenosha look dangerous and put off already uneasy tourists. They believe the boards need to go for the city to appear welcoming and for people to truly move on. “The boards need to come down, so that those of us that are still here can heal,” says Warner.

When I asked why some are still boarded up, downtown business owners agreed it is largely out of fear. Some small business owners without boarded windows, who are trying to “get back to normal,” would not talk to me out of fear they could be targeted with boycotts or violence.

We Must Hold Governor Evers Accountable

Many Kenoshans are still waiting for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers to be held accountable for the riots and the lingering fear and emotional damage they have inflicted on the community. The revisionist history to avoid this kind of accountability began right away, with Joe Biden calling for the officer involved to be charged and Evers all but declaring the shooting an act of attempted murder and racism.

The demonization of the officer and the canonization of Blake were based on a lie. The officer who shot Blake has been cleared. Blake has pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct and was sentenced to two years of probation.

Even one Kenoshan I interviewed in uptown, who says he believes there is racism in the Kenosha Police Department and wishes Blake hadn’t been shot, said he understands why Blake was shot. “After going over the footage of the shooting,” he said, “as an officer I probably would have been a little scared too.”

More important, however, is how the false narrative from Evers, Biden, and the corporate press fueled the dangerous rioting that led to death and destruction. The heads of four Wisconsin law enforcement groups sent a letter to Evers last year, urging him to “refrain from making statements specific to Kenosha Police involved shooting until the facts of the investigation are known,” because it puts the lives of officers and the public at risk.

Evers did not just hurt the city with false rhetoric. He watched Kenosha burn at the hands of out-of-state thugs for three nights and stubbornly refused to send adequate aid quickly, actions residents believe could have prevented the riots. Within 24 hours of receiving requests for aid, Evers had sent fewer troops to Kenosha than he did to Milwaukee during the NBA finals.

By the second night, it appeared many outsider left-wing professional rioters from groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter were pouring into the city and reaping terror and destruction.

I was there on the second night, when officers were still grossly unprepared for the flood of outside rioters. At the time, I wrote that Kenosha looked like “something I had only seen in photos of war-torn countries.”

Since law enforcement only had enough staff to protect public buildings, regular homes and businesses were left to individual self-defense. “Men and women stood with baseball bats, hand-guns, semi-automatic rifles, and shotguns in front of their businesses and homes,” I wrote at the time.

Chuck has been spending every night on his roof guarding his uptown tire shop “with guns.” He believes the rioting will affect the 2020 election, and he is “for Trump all the way.” To the rioters he says: “Come to my shop and I’ll blow your heads off.” pic.twitter.com/5oFvKgj2c5 — The Federalist (@FDRLST) August 28, 2020

It wasn’t until three individuals were shot and two died on the third night that Evers accepted help from President Trump and sent in enough national guardsmen to quell the riots.

“Governor Evers has a huge sense of urgency for mask mandates, but when our town is burning to the flippin’ ground, he had zero sense of urgency,” says Warner. “He allowed our town to suffer and burn.”

Today, Evers is still desperately trying to rewrite the narrative. “In a flurry of articles this past week, Governor Evers, his administration, and local partisans have launched a concerted effort to sugarcoat what the governor did and did not do before, during, and after the riots,” writes Steil in a Kenosha News op-ed.

Another Kenosha Coming to a Town Near You?

Rule of law and police procedures did not matter to Democrats in the media and public office who wished to use the Blake shooting to push their political agenda. This agenda is the same as it has been for the entire BLM movement: radical social change.

Leftists’ real goal is not to eradicate racism. If it was, they wouldn’t be inciting riots where racism is not to blame. Instead, their aim is socialism — and what better way to advocate for the “equity” of socialism than to argue the entire American system is stacked against black and brown people.

Leftists are flat-out lying about police shootings like that of Blake, and indoctrinating the next generation into believing their lies by implementing critical race theory in schools across the country. Kids in K-12 are learning they are inherently racist if they are white and have no chance of success if they are black. While there are still Americans today willing to push back against these lies, the left is trying to ensure that by the next generation there won’t be any.

“If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” says Winstar. No one would have ever thought Kenosha, a small working-class city, could see such turmoil, but it did. And every small town across America needs to be prepared. The left’s policies will make every city and town like Portland, Washington D.C., and New York City. They want everyone’s children to be force-fed critical race theory, and every town to respond to police shootings and arrests with “abolish the police” riots.

We are in a fight against propaganda and lies. The whitewashing of the preventable, deadly events of Kenosha perfectly encapsulates what’s at stake. We simply cannot allow Evers, Biden, and leftist media to rewrite history. Kenosha was the result of fabricated Democrat outrage and deception.

The price for their political posturing was catastrophic in terms of lives lost and livelihoods and dreams destroyed. We cannot forget the images and video from the Kenosha riots. We must remain vigilant and hold those responsible accountable. It’s the only way to prevent it from coming to a town near you.

You Don't Need To Go To Kabul To See The End Of American Order,"The nation’s attention these past two weeks has focused nearly exclusively on Kabul, and rightly so given that the city has become the scene of the largest hostage situation in American history and a vivid image of the decline of Pax Americana abroad.

But Americans don’t need to travel 7,500 miles to get a first-hand glimpse of the end of American order. In many of our own country’s major cities, gangs of masked thugs and criminals do what they please — and our far-better-armed police aren’t allowed to stop them and protect the rest of us.

Take one August Sunday in Portland, Oregon, where two days ago political gangs roamed freely, beating people, including women, and even opening fire downtown. Meanwhile the police, who have been threatened with government action if they intervene, were nowhere to be seen.

The breakdown of law and order was crafted in the offices of politicians, and its results are as immediate as they are sickening: A beautiful port city is now a frequent host to pitched battles between masked and helmeted left- and right-wing mobs spanning across city blocks; paintballs, pepper spray, fireworks, and beatings in broad daylight; and while innocent civilians flee the violence under a cloudy gray sky, the only sounds audible are of rioting — with nary a police siren in the distance.

It’s long not been safe to be a reporter in Portland: Just Sunday, Antifa targeted independent journalist and photographer Maranie Staab. “You f-cking endangered people by flying to f-cking Colombia and endangering everyone by opening them up to COVID, you little slut,” one masked and armored man screamed at Staab, referring to her June reporting on violence in South America.

Minutes later, Antifa members pepper-sprayed her, knocked her to the ground, and reportedly broke her phone and damaged her camera, yelling, “How many times do we have to f-cking tell you?”

After other reporters moved her away from the mob and helped her wash out her eyes and mouth, an Antifa member sprayed them (and their cameras) with more paint. Once again, police were nowhere to be seen or even heard.

That same day, during riots and demonstrations downtown, a man opened fire on Antifa members, who reportedly fired back. Police were nowhere to be heard or seen, though they arrested the man minutes later.

So where are the police, exactly? Law and order has slowly, and then rapidly, broken down in Portland for years, with images of besieged courthouses, lawless “autonomous zones,” open drugs and violent crime, and roving, organized mobs hitting honest newspapers across the United States nearly every week. Indeed, Sunday’s festivities were organized to celebrate a violent clash that had taken place the year before.

Amid it all, local and national politicians have repeatedly attacked and undermined the men and women who maintain order at great personal risk, cutting the police budget by millions and threatening further cuts along the way.

Then on July 19, the governor signed a new law that opened police officers using non-lethal, anti-mob force to personal prosecution. This, independent journalist Andy Ngo reports, was “the final nail for an effective permanent police stand down.”

Sources tell me the final nail for an effective permanent police stand down was when Oregon Dems passed a law banning most use of crowd control tools. Officers who violate Bill 2928 can be criminally prosecuted. It was passed in support of the BLM-Antifa riots last year. pic.twitter.com/8CyXtqodlN — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) August 24, 2021

Therein lies an interesting connection to the most recent disaster we’ve been watching abroad: In Portland, city leaders demand say their refusal to back their own police or enforce their own laws “is a national problem that demands national resources,” adding that “the idea that Portland, or any city, can single handedly defeat white nationalism is a fallacy.” Across the country in Washington, White House leaders pretend 10-15,000 stranded Americans, a captured military base, hijacked American equipment in enemy hands, and outnumbered soldiers and Marines in a civilian airport surrounded by the Taliban is just what all withdrawals look like.

All of this is completely false, of course — both these crises, in their immediate senses, have been created by the foolish decisions of the people directly in charge of them. We don’t need a time traveler from 2010 to teach us how to maintain peace in our cities, just as we don’t need Alexander the Great to teach us to remove civilians and equipment before the military departs and to hold bases until they aren’t needed anymore.

Our country here and abroad is held captive by radical and lying politicians unwilling to tell the truth or face it. Drive into your closest major city anywhere in the country and there’s a good chance it’s gotten a lot worse than it was just a few years ago. Look at any foreign paper and see that our word is worth a lot less than it was just a few weeks ago.

Neither of these is, or were, inevitable: They are the conscious decisions of a country in decline. We don’t have much time to put things right, but we know what we have to do to fix these things; the answers aren’t arcane. It already might be too late, but it’s worth the fight.

Capitol Officer Who Shot Ashli Babbitt Left His Gun In A Bathroom In 2019,"Michael Byrd, the U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, is the same officer who left his gun unattended in a Capitol bathroom in 2019.

Capitol Police found Byrd’s Glock 22 in a Capitol Visitor Center complex bathroom in February 2019 “during a routine security sweep.” At the time, Byrd was the Capitol Police commander of the House Chambers and was scheduled for work the next two days after the incident. The police department launched an investigation into Byrd’s negligence, but he was eventually allowed to stay on the force.

In an exclusive interview with Byrd, NBC’s Lester Holt asked the officer about the investigation and how it’s “been brought up by those who were questioning your competency.”

“Do you want to respond to that?” Holt asked.

“It was a terrible mistake. I acknowledged it. I owned up to it, accepted the responsibility. I was penalized for it and I moved on,” Byrd said before Holt cut to another topic.

While Byrd claims he showed “utmost courage” and “saved countless lives” on Jan. 6 after taking out Babbitt, whom he said “posed a threat,” the legal team representing the late Babbitt’s family said she “was not brandishing a weapon, not in close proximity to members of Congress, and was not an imminent threat of death or serious injury to anyone.”

Byrd acknowledged that she wasn’t armed but said it didn’t change his confidence in drawing and firing his gun.

Capitol Police recently announced that it found Byrd’s actions to be lawful and unworthy of pursuing any other action against. This decision came shortly after the Department of Justice chose not to charge Byrd, who was referred to at the time as an unnamed police officer.

Democratic Mayors Refuse To Take Action As Violent Crime Surges In Pennsylvania,"Amid surging crime in Pennsylvania’s largest cities, it remains unclear if Democratic leadership is up to the task of ensuring law and order.

Take Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, who faces intensifying criticism as the city grapples with a public safety crisis. This year, 137 children under age 18 have been shot in city neighborhoods, and 32 have died. “That’s a bullet ripping into a young person’s body every 40 hours,” wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Helen Ubiñas.

Last month, after a 15-year-old girl was shot in the head in North Philadelphia (she died the next day), community activists called for Kenney to deploy the Pennsylvania National Guard in the crime-ridden city. Kenney, though, said it is not an “effective tool to bring in uniformed, camouflaged, gun-rifle-carrying people in helmets to address [the crime] problem.”

Recent data indicate that Philadelphia, where crime declined in the early 2010s, is now the second-deadliest city in the United States behind Chicago. As the Philadelphia Inquirer recently put it, “There’s only been one day so far this year – Jan. 2 – when not a single person was shot in the city.” The city experienced a 30-year homicide high in 2020. So far this year, homicides are up more than 24 percent and shootings more than 25 percent, according to data from the Philadelphia Police Department.

“The epidemic of gun violence in Philadelphia is out of control and our elected officials in the city need to step up and take responsibility,” said Nick Gerace, a retired longtime Philadelphia police officer and president of Protect Our Police PAC.

Prosecutions have fallen dramatically under Larry Krasner, the city’s progressive district attorney who has sparred with Kenney. As it stands, 65 percent of gun charges have been dismissed or withdrawn this year, marking a 17 percent increase since 2015. In 2015, there were 375 guilty pleas; in 2020, just 148.

Yet Kenney has deflected blame. In July, for example, the mayor sent a letter to a city council member who favors declaring the gun crisis an “emergency” and claimed that doing so “is not a solution that will demonstrably change conditions in Philadelphia.”

Earlier this summer, after the City Council voted to cut police funding by $33 million for fiscal year 2021, the mayor agreed to eliminate a $19 million increase and cut existing funding by $14 million.

Carlos Vega, a longtime assistant district attorney who unsuccessfully ran against Krasner in May’s Democratic primary, told me that the defund-the-police movement will fail.

“It’s communities of color being killed,” Vega said, observing how 85 percent of this year’s homicide victims are black. “People have not thought through the impact defund the police is going to have on communities who are suffering the most.”

Philadelphia is not alone among Pennsylvania cities in failing to stave off crime. Often overlooked amid the nationwide crime surge is Pittsburgh, in recent years considered the Rust Belt’s greatest urban success story.

Following last summer’s riots, homicides have about doubled in Pittsburgh in 2021 over the first six months. As recently as April, the city saw a 90 percent surge in violence, with police officers pleading for more programs and funding. Young people continue to fall victim to violence, and nonfatal shootings are up about 68%, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In late August, the University of Pittsburgh warned students about “violent criminal activity,” especially in the popular South Side neighborhood.

Still, earlier this year, Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto slashed the police budget by $5.3 million. Last summer, not long after a disorderly demonstrator was arrested near Peduto’s neighborhood – leading to protests at his house – the mayor acknowledged the “right for people to take to the streets to demand much-needed reforms.”

But Peduto’s praise for protesters wasn’t enough to survive the city’s Democratic mayoral primary this past May. The more progressive Ed Gainey is poised to win his job in November.

Gainey, a state representative who earned endorsements from Democratic socialists and a major health care union, went so far as to accuse Peduto of “overpolicing” the city. He has pledged to “redirect” law enforcement funds to social services.

Pittsburgh’s GOP insiders see no end in sight to the city’s surging crime. Bob Hillen, chairman of the Republican Committee of Pittsburgh, thinks that far-left Democratic leadership under Gainey will continue to give crime a “free pass.”

“We could use more police on the streets right now,” Hillen told me. “I mean, every night there is a shooting. This is well out of hand. We have to do something quick.”

Other regional Republicans are more optimistic. When asked about getting the Steel City’s crime situation under control, Republican state Rep. Rob Mercuri of Allegheny County said, “We can do this if we work together in the Pittsburgh region.”

The GOP is strategizing on how to oust Democrats in a historically moderate state. The focus is on Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. “Bill Peduto and Jim Kenney are gaslighting and deflecting blame,” says Allie Carroll, spokeswoman for the state Republican National Committee.

Kenney is term-limited, with Philadelphia’s next mayoral race in 2022, while Gainey is primed to assume office in a city that hasn’t elected a Republican mayor in 88 years. So Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, two Democratic strongholds, find themselves in similar straits. Will their problems trigger a statewide political backlash?

Australia's COVID Police State Happens When You Give Up Your Guns,"Since the outset of the COVID-19 lockdowns, Australia has instituted some of the strictest lockdown measures in the western world. Once viewed as a free, prosperous society, the nation has slowly devolved into a full-fledged police state. with the federal government even going as far as to prohibit citizens from leaving the country.

At the state level, the situation is seemingly worse, with the severity of COVID restrictions varying among localities. In the Greater Sydney region of New South Wales, local authorities have restricted most interstate travel, forcibly shuttered places of worship, and limited the reasons individuals are allowed to leave their homes. Likewise in Victoria, where citizens remain in indefinite lockdown, state officials have instituted a curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. in metropolitan Melbourne.

Most recently, the government of South Australia decided to expand their police powers even further, with officials announcing plans for a new app that uses facial recognition software to track the movements and location of its citizens to ensure universal compliance with state COVID regulations.

“People in South Australia will be forced to download an app that combines facial recognition and geolocation,” The Atlantic reported. “The state will text them at random times, and thereafter they will have 15 minutes to take a picture of their face in the location where they are supposed to be. Should they fail, the local police department will be sent to follow up in person.”

Coupled with egregious reports of a father getting arrested in front of his infant child for going maskless at a local park and police detaining hundreds of lockdown protestors, the country bears all the hallmarks of a dying, once-free society.

Aussies Gave Up Their Liberty With Their Arms

While they may not realize it, Australian citizens relinquished any guarantees to individual liberty the moment they allowed their government to ban private gun ownership decades prior. Following a horrific mass shooting in 1996, Australia took up a series of extreme gun control measures that effectively made it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to own a firearm.

In addition to banning “semi-automatic rifles” and “certain categories of shotgun,” the nation’s government also issued a compulsory gun “buyback” program that resulted in the confiscation of up to 1 million guns from Australian citizens. Moreover, the law also proclaims that “personal protection” and “protection of property” are not genuine reasons for an individual to acquire a firearm permit.

Once signed into law, the legislation efficaciously removed any form of control Aussies had over their individual rights. Rather than entrusting themselves to safeguard society’s civil liberties, Australians instead rendered all responsibility to the government.

In the American context, the Founding Fathers understood that the right of the people to “keep and bear arms” was a absolute necessity. Having learned from the fallen nations of the past, the Framers understood that the citizenry must be armed in order to prevent the state from encroaching upon their God-given rights.

This of course hasn’t stopped U.S. Democrats from attempting to implement a version of Australian-style gun control, with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both signaling their support for a nationwide confiscation of firearms.

“Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets,” the Biden-Harris campaign site reads. “This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.”

Biden also made a similar pledge during a 2019 interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, saying that he would “institute a national buyback program” and that he “would move it in the direction of making sure that that in fact is what we try to do, get [assault weapons] off the street.”

While Americans are fortunate enough to have a Constitution that protects against such tyrannical overreach so long as judges and lawmakers are willing to apply it faithfully, Australians are not as lucky. Not only does the Constitution of Australia lack any right to bear arms, but the document is also absent of a bill of rights for the Australian people. Unlike similar liberal democracies around the world, Australia has largely provided its federal and state parliaments with the power to dictate what constitutes as an individual right.

By surrendering their arms to the state all those years ago, the Australian people mistakenly placed the defense of a free society in the hands of infallible politicians, who are beyond capable of sin and have demonstrated a clear willingness to violate the very ideals that have made Western civilization unique. The COVID totalitarianism Aussies find themselves in today serves as a stark reminder to forever safeguard the right to self-defense, for it will offer more security than any government could ever guarantee.

Don't Let Wendy Osefo Of ‘Real Housewives’ Explain Police To Your Kids,"It’s a good thing Wendy Osefo of Bravo’s “The Real Housewives of Potomac” let her husband do most of the talking with their children on policing in America. If she had been the one to do it, she likely would have filled their heads with nonsense about cops everywhere shooting unarmed black people for sport.

Osefo told her husband Eddie on the latest episode that the two should talk with their young boys “about police and relationships with police.” The scene was apparently shot around the time the Derek Chauvin trial was taking place, which Osefo, who is black, said “just made me wanting to shelter” her kids.

“I think it’s unfair that black parents have to break their children’s innocence to prepare them for the world that they live in,” she said.

Fortunately, Eddie took the lead on that conversation and told their boys more or less that some cops are bad, but his wife apparently needs her own special lecture about police and race. She has bought into the media myth that black people, men in particular, are at constant risk of being gunned down by racist cops.

It’s a lie, even though dishonest news outlets say things like “negative experiences with the police” are “an unfortunate rite of passage for many Black Americans.” That claim appeared in Politico back in June, but let’s do something Politico didn’t do — let’s look at data.

The Police-Public Contact Survey conducted every so often by the Justice Department asks respondents about their interactions with law enforcement. The latest survey is from 2018. That year, just 6.5 million black people said they had any type of contact with police. Among those, just 251,000 of them said they experienced a threat or use of force by law enforcement. This doesn’t take into account whether the threat or use of force was justified, but only that a respondent says it happened.

The total black population in the United States sits at 42,640,000, according to the Census. That would mean that barely above half of a percent of the entire black population claims to have experienced a threat or use of force when interacting with police.

When something is experienced by half of a percent of all black people, we probably shouldn’t be describing it as a “rite of passage for many black Americans.”

Now let’s look at the worst-case scenario: A black person is shot dead by a cop. The Washington Post tries to keep track of that each year. For the last full year, 2020, the Post says a total of 18 black people died in police shootings. Again, this doesn’t account for whether each shooting was justified, only that it happened.

Put another way, 0.00004 percent of the black population in 2020 was killed by cops with guns. For each year that the Post has been keeping track, the number of black people shot dead by cops never got higher than 38 and that was back in 2015.

That’s the devastating reality that Wendy Osefo has been wanting to “shelter” her kids from? That’s the “unfair” truth for black parents that “break their children’s innocence”?

McAuliffe Snaps At Sheriff For Asking About His Ties To 'Defund Police' Group,"Democrat gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe snapped at a Virginia sheriff on Wednesday, after the law enforcement officer brought up the former governor’s acceptance of endorsements from leftist groups that support defunding the police.

The moment came during an event hosted by the Virginia Sheriff’s Association in Roanoke, wherein Montgomery County Sheriff Hank Partin questioned McAuliffe over his acceptance of an endorsement from an organization that has publicly called for defunding law enforcement.

“On July 20, you accepted an endorsement from the New Virginia Majority,” said Partin. “They are a large, ‘defund the police’ organization, who want to abolish prisons and [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] ICE. You’ve said that you were proud to accept their endorsement.”

In response, McAuliffe defended his acceptance of the endorsement, while also attacking Partin for bringing up the issue.

“Now first of all sheriff, I proudly accept any endorsements, I get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds,” he said. “Groups that support me, I don’t know whether they do. Have I ever supported ‘defund the police’? Are you out of your mind?”

When asked to commit to never defunding law enforcement, McAuliffe again snapped at the sheriff, while also declining to answer whether he would ever defund the police if reelected governor.

“If my track record of four years as governor is not enough for you to understand how I feel on law enforcement, then I will not dignify that with an answer,” he said. McAuliffe had previously served as governor of Virginia from 2014-2018.

A review of New Virginia Majority’s Twitter feed finds Partin’s accusations to be true, with the organization repeatedly calling for defunding law enforcement and abolishing ICE.

“Defund the police and invest in education, health care, and housing for our communities!” the group said in a June 2020 tweet.

Upon the organization’s endorsement of McAuliffe for the 2021 gubernatorial race, the former governor took to Twitter to say that he was “proud” to have their support.

“Together, we are going to keep Virginia moving forward,” he said. “That starts with building a more inclusive Commonwealth that lifts up working people across Virginia. Onward!”

The acceptance of New Virginia Majority’s July 20 endorsement is hardly the first time McAuliffe has embraced the support of groups that want to defund law enforcement, however. A day prior, the Democrat gubernatorial candidate had accepted the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, a pro-abortion group that called for defunding the police in June 2020.

McAuliffe’s GOP opponent Glenn Youngkin quickly responded to the matter, with campaign spokesman Christian Martinez telling The Federalist that the former governor “has a record of retaliating against sheriffs who don’t give him total loyalty.”

“McAuliffe turned his back on law enforcement officers by refusing to meet with the Virginia Police Benevolent Association and embracing radical groups that want to defund the police and abolish prisons,” Martinez said. “McAuliffe failed to keep Virginians safe the last time he was governor, and he will fail again with his anti-police policies that are too dangerous and extreme for Virginia.”

"Of All The Third-World Cities I’ve Lived In, Baltimore Was The Worst","It only took seven months after my family and I moved to Baltimore in January for us to move out. We’re hardly the only ones leaving — in 2020, Baltimore lost more residents than did any other major U.S. city. At one point, my Brazilian husband remarked, “I thought America was a developed country.”

His observation is particularly telling because, before coming to Baltimore, we spent five years living abroad in two of the most dangerous places in the world – Brazil and South Africa. In many ways, life in those countries was easier than life in Charm City.

The residents of Baltimore pay some of the highest taxes in the country for some of the worst public services. Crime is a constant threat, even though the neighborhood where we lived is usually labeled “gentrifying.” A professional exterminator warned us never to buy second-hand furniture due to the prevalence of bed bugs. Everyone on our block kept a cat – often two or three – to combat the rodents.

After we fled to the suburbs, I was left pondering why life in Brazil and South Africa was easier — particularly South Africa, which has many parallels with America because it reached a fairly high level of development, but ruinous government policies are now driving it backward. Public services in South Africa have been so deeply riddled with corruption and mismanagement for so long, citizens have learned to do without or developed workarounds, something the residents of Baltimore haven’t learned yet.

Ballooning Crime and Ill-Equipped Police

Baltimore and South Africa are both infamous for high crime rates. In South Africa, police are helpless and incompetent. For example, a few years ago, the police cybercrimes unit had to drop hundreds of cases because they forgot to pay for their software licenses. They can also be corrupt; South Africans told me stories about police officers demanding bribes to do routine tasks like writing up a car accident report.

As a result, everyone from the lower middle class and upward pays for private security. In the small city where we lived, a local security firm patrolled the streets like a private police force. Even the police sometimes hire private security to guard their precincts.

In Baltimore, the number of reported homicides reached a record high in 2015 after the city erupted in riots at the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. In the wake of the riots, police became less visible on the streets, and they have not returned. The Baltimore police department operates with around 400 unfilled vacancies. The city’s homicide rate has yet to fall to pre-2015 levels.

While the current condition and recent history of police in Baltimore and South Africa are different, the outcome is the same: criminals run rampant. Neighborhoods and businesses in Baltimore appear to be gradually moving towards the South African solution: private security.

South Africans do not mess around with their safety. In addition to hiring private security, they protect their houses with things like tall electric fences, CCTV, guard dogs, and motion sensors. People in Baltimore are still naïve in that regard. I followed several online groups for city residents. Many of the posts were by people whose houses had just been burgled, who often shared images from their security cameras. I was amazed to note most of them did not even have a fence in their backyards.

Decrepit Public Services

I also found myself surprised that people in Baltimore – and Americans in general – still rely heavily on the U.S. Postal Service. We sometimes only saw our mailman once a week and he often brought us other people’s mail. In South Africa, the postal service has been a disaster for so long that many people have stopped sending mail at all.

Other public services in South Africa were just as bad. Usually, the poor are left with scraps, while those with money usually pay twice: once in taxes for worthless public services and then for a private solution that actually works.

Electricity is very expensive in South Africa because the state utility Eskom is corrupt and mismanaged. Millions of people live without electricity, while those who can afford to pay Eskom’s rates also have to buy generators or solar panels as a backup for the regular power outages.

South Africa’s constitution includes the right to water, but this right is violated all over their country every day. The tap water in the city where we lived was unsafe, so we bought large containers from one of the many local “water shops.” Other people take it a step further by drilling boreholes and installing their own filtration systems. In one city, a group of citizens took over running their local water and sewage plants because they were so badly mismanaged.

Community solidarity like this was common in South Africa, and made the difficulties manageable. South Africans organize private groups to do things like fill potholes, repair or repaint road signs, and collect garbage. They form neighborhood watch groups that partner with professional private security firms.

There are certainly significant tensions between different ethnic groups in South Africa, but within individual groups, I observed a very strong culture of looking out for one another. We lived in a college town, and students in their late teens and early twenties regularly helped us with things like home repairs or running errands. This was already their normal way of life. In a difficult country like South Africa, “going it alone” is not an option.

In Baltimore online discussion groups, people often posted comments like “we have to work together” or “we should stand up.” I agree, but until they turn those words turn into offline actions, life in their city will not improve much.

Baltimore is a particularly bad case. But in many other American cities, crime rates are rising and the quality of public services is dropping. If we have any hope of reversing the decay, we should take note and act now.

"Even After Backlash, McAuliffe Getting Key Help From Group Pushing Police Defunding","Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe is receiving assistance from a pro-abortion group that has called for defunding the police, despite the former governor’s previous attempts to paint himself as friendly to law enforcement.

According to a phone banking script obtained by The Federalist, NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia is having volunteer callers identify themselves as “a volunteer with the campaign to elect Terry McAuliffe, Hala Ayala, Mark Herring, & [HOUSE CANDIDATE]” when phoning Virginia voters about the upcoming statewide election.

The script also instructs volunteer callers to ask voters on who they plan to vote for in the upcoming gubernatorial race, in which voters leaning or strongly backing McAuliffe are thanked for their support and encouraged to vote for other Democrats on the ticket.

“I’m so glad to hear we’re in this together!” the script reads. “You should also support Hala Ayala for Lieutenant Governor & Attorney General Mark Herring for re-election – the other two statewide Democrats on the ticket this year.”

“I’m not sure if you’ve heard yet, but this year, any registered Virginian can vote early in-person. It’s super convenient because you can vote when it fits your schedule between September 18th & October 30th,” it adds.

Furthermore, callers are instructed to ask voters about what method they plan to use to vote in the election, with the script providing a list of responses that instruct voters on how to cast their ballot.

“Anyway, I hope you’ll decide to support Terry [McAuliffe] — I have some campaign literature I can give you with

more information about him!” the script continues. Voters leaning or strongly supporting GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin are thanked for their time and hung up on.

While notably a pro-abortion group, NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia has waded into other political arenas in recent years, with the organization publicly calling for the defunding of law enforcement in June 2020.

“ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Defund the police,” the group tweeted. “Invest in Black communities. Tell Donald Trump to resign.”

The organization also announced its endorsement of McAuliffe in July, of which the former governor said he was “proud” to accept.

I’m proud to be endorsed by @NARALVirginia. With a right-wing Supreme Court ready to hack away at the right to choose and Glenn Youngkin promising to ban abortion, reproductive freedom is at stake in this race. I’ll always fight to protect the right to choose. pic.twitter.com/bySHCdytge — Terry McAuliffe (@TerryMcAuliffe) July 19, 2021

As polls have begun to show the Virginia contest as a toss-up, however, McAuliffe has attempted to distance himself from the “defund the police” movement. Despite being supportive of ending qualified immunity for police officers during the Democrat primary, the former governor has since attempted to backtrack on the issue.

“I have always said that any law officer is out acting in good faith, doing their job, they will have the full protection of the Commonwealth of Virginia,” he claimed in a recent debate. “But if there is a law enforcement officer who breaks the law, they get zero protection.”

“Terry McAuliffe will defund the police with the help of his radical allies at NARAL, and this anti-police agenda will result in mass police retirements and make Virginians less safe,” Youngkin campaign spokesman Christian Martinez told The Federalist. “Glenn Youngkin has the overwhelming support of law enforcement officers across the Commonwealth because they know McAuliffe is too dangerous and too extreme for Virginia.”

The McAuliffe campaign and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia did not respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

George Soros Just Dropped $500K To Keep Austin Police Defunded,"Billionaire Democrat megadonor George Soros knows how to influence an election, and his latest ballot venture is trying to keep the police force defunded in Austin, Texas.

According to financial records, Soros funneled $500,000 to Equity PAC, a political action committee that opposes a proposition to hire more police officers, on Sept. 27. The proposition, Proposition A, is set for a Nov. 2 vote and would require the police department to hire hundreds more officers, have at least two officers per 1,000 residents, and give officers an extra 40 hours of police training.

“It sickens me that out of town billionaires are able to swoop into Austin to fight against citizen-led ballot initiatives,” Austin City Council member Mackenzie Kelly told Fox News. “The purpose of our city’s charter is to allow regular, everyday people to fight for what they believe in when the city council fails them.”

After George Floyd riots swept the country last year, the Austin City Council stripped $150 million from the city’s police department, reallocating the money into other public services. Although the department was partially refunded early this year, Proposition A would restore more funding to Austin law enforcement.

Matt Mackowiak, co-founder of Save Austin Now, a political action committee supporting Proposition A, tweeted Friday that “national left wing interests are trying to destroy public safety in Austin.”

Soros, whose cushy Hamptons estates are well protected, has spent tens of millions of dollars swaying local races across the country, including getting a number of law-and-order-flouting prosecutors elected. The billionaire financier, who is worth an estimated $8.6 billion, has been funding Black Lives Matter and other radical organizations for years.

This year, Austin has seen a 200 percent uptick in murders. According to Save Austin Now, 96 percent of police shifts in the city are not fully staffed, and over 80 percent of residents surveyed feel that the city is unsafe. Burglaries, muggings, rapes, and more crimes are on the rise, and Austin’s diluted police force doesn’t have the resources to stop them.

“Massive out-of-state funding for our opponents show two things: That Austin donors won’t fund the anti-Prop A campaign and that the stakes in this effort to restore public safety to Austin could not be higher,” Mackowiak and Save Austin Now co-founder Cleo Petricek said in a joint statement. “We are now going to fight twice as hard and we hope all our supporters will as well.”

"The Left Wanted To Destroy The Police, And So Far They’ve Succeeded","For the past year-and-a-half, “police reform” has been at the center of public debate. After President Joe Biden and leftist Democrats took power, the radicals reintroduced their legislation to “reimagine” policing — the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

We were told that it was of momentous importance, yet three weeks ago, when it was announced that Senate negotiations had failed and the bill was finished, the overall reaction from the left was general indifference. Ruling class media expressed perfunctory outrage for a day or two, and then the issue disappeared. Why?

Let’s take a moment to consider how we got here. The real purpose of Democrats’ Black Lives Matter-inspired legislation was to destroy policing, not to improve it, as I observed last May. The bill was poison. It was built upon the big lie that American policing is systemically racist.

We saw almost a year of Black Lives Matter and Antifa mob violence with 574 riots; $2 billion in destruction, arson, and looting; at least 25 dead; and more than 2,000 police officers injured. To re-enforce this spirit of lawlessness, leftist prosecutors dismissed most charges against rioters and looters in Portland, New York City, and across the country.

While every aspect of the Democrat bill was designed to undermine law enforcement, two provisions would have directly dismantled the police and resulted in thousands more black people being killed. First, the bill would have stripped the protection of qualified immunity for individual officers, causing more officers to leave the job or retreat from fighting crime. Second, in deference to tenets of critical race theory, the bill would have made it law that any group-identity statistical disparities in investigation or enforcement results would constitute prima facie proof of racial profiling.

Law-abiding minority citizens want the police in their communities. Eighty-one percent of black Americans want to keep or increase the number of police officers in their neighborhoods. But this bill would have prevented police from proactively policing high-crime black communities. A leftist, race-based enforcement quota system would have permanently diverted vital police resources away from high violent-crime neighborhoods.

Mission Almost Accomplished

So why was the radical left so quiet when its legislative plan to destroy policing failed? Because their mission has already been almost completely accomplished. In virtually every major Democrat-run city and beyond, policing as we know it has been undermined beyond recognition — perhaps beyond repair.

The numbers speak for themselves. America’s crime epidemic saw a 30 percent homicide surge in 2020, the biggest ever. Almost 10,000 homicide victims were black — 53 percent of all victims, despite blacks constituting only 13 percent of the U.S. population.

The Black Lives Matter Marxists’ program of defunding, demonizing, and dismantling the police has emboldened criminals and caused police to pull back. The war on cops has also escalated. Already this year, 241 officers have been shot, 44 killed by gunfire, and ambush attacks have increased 103 percent.

Black Lives Matter, Democrats, the ruling class media, and rogue prosecutors have broken the police. Perpetuating the myth of systemic police racism has justified eliminating cash bail, ending qualified immunity, and enacting laws that practically legalize theft. In Democrat-run cities, proactive policing is dead. Officer morale is at rock bottom and many of the most qualified veterans are bailing out. Last year across the country, retirements increased by 45 percent and resignations by 18 percent.

Finally, the radical left has insidiously and effectively undermined our law and civil order through an organized takeover of states’ attorneys offices by radicals. Funded by leftist billionaire George Soros, these rogue prosecutors subvert the system from within — dismissing thousands of felony cases, failing to charge violent criminals, and arbitrarily refusing to prosecute quality-of-life crimes, such as public urination or prostitution.

In this way, no matter how effective local police are at arresting criminals, their efforts are sabotaged. Massive spikes in violence are directly connected to pro-criminal Soros prosecutors in Chicago, Baltimore, Austin, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and other Democrat-run jurisdictions.

Last year’s BLM/Antifa armed rioting and today’s out-of-control violent crime demonstrate that when the mob and street criminals run wild and police pull back, American civilization disintegrates. This is the ultimate objective of the leftist elites.

How Can We Fight Back?

Faced with such a vast array of anti-police power, what can we do? Two options remain. In Democrat-run cities, residents and neighbors must organize, speak out, and take grassroots political action outside the Democratic Party machine. In Republican states, citizens and elected leaders must enact unabashedly pro-police laws and policies — everything the Democrats are not.

Unfortunately, in most Democrat-run cities with leftist mayors and city councils, subversive prosecutors, and increasingly more woke police chiefs, things will get a lot worse before they get better. Violent crime is intensifying and spreading, but average citizens are beginning to fight back.

Austin, Texas, is ruled by a leftist Democrat mayor and city council who enacted one of the most radical defund the police efforts in the country — $150 million, one-third of the police budget, was cut. The result has been a public safety disaster. Homicides in the city have increased 44 percent over last year and 200 percent compared to five years ago. During the past year, police retirements increased 65 percent and resignations 63 percent. Undermanned, the Austin Police Department no longer responds to citizens’ 911 calls for eight categories of crimes and disturbances.

But Austin residents have stood up, putting an initiative on the November 2 ballot to hire more police officers and increase officer training. However, the arrogance and extent to which leftist elites will go to demolish the police knows no bounds. Soros, who funded the radical Travis County district attorney, has also sunk $500,000 into a campaign to defeat Austin citizens’ public safety initiative.

Florida Leads

Fighting for the police and preserving the rule of law in every Republican state is crucial. In this fight, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is leading the way.

Of all America’s governors, DeSantis has been the most outspoken in his support for police and the rule of law, proclaiming, “Make no mistake: the reason that you have such huge spikes in crime in many parts of the country is because of not standing up for law enforcement, having weak policies where you’re letting people out, and you’re not prosecuting people who are committing habitual offenses. That is clearly causing disastrous consequences.”

Under DeSantis, Florida enacted the “Anti-Riot Bill,” increasing penalties for crimes committed during violent assemblies and protecting law enforcement officers and law-abiding citizens. The Florida law also makes it more difficult for municipalities to defund the police.

The leftist elites, whether in the form of Black Lives Matter Marxists, Antifa anarchists, socialist Democrats, subversive district attorneys, or critical race theory race hustlers, know that American civilization cannot survive without law, order, and public safety. This is the reason they are destroying the police. And this is the reason that the American people must stop them.

Lightfoot Refuses To Pay Unvaxxed Chicago Police Amid Crime Crisis,"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is placing police officers who refuse to get the COVID-19 jab on unpaid leave during the Windy City’s raging crime spree.

While the “defund the police” Democrat claimed on Monday that only a “very small number” of officers were demoted to no-pay status, CNN reported on Friday that “up to half of Chicago’s rank-and-file police officers” were at risk of losing their pay over the shot mandate. By Monday, a third of the officers were still not in compliance. When The Federalist inquired about the actual number of officers who were cut off from their paychecks over the weekend due to the vaccine mandate dispute, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) deflected to the mayor’s office, which said the number would not be made public.

This decision to shun an unknown number of officers comes as the city tries to fend off a crisis of deadly and violent crime against Chicago citizens, including children and police officers. Lightfoot framed the vaccine mandate as the “only way that we can maximize safety in our workplace,” but the dozens of daily shootings and violent offenses in the Windy City are alarming Chicagoans concerned about their safety.

Lightfoot’s order currently forces all Chicago city employees to get the shot or comply with weekly testing. Beginning Jan. 1, 2022, however, Chicago workers will have to get vaccinated or be approved for an exemption to keep their jobs. The CPD warned officers who did not comply by the arbitrary Thursday, Oct. 14 at midnight deadline that they would “become the subject of a disciplinary investigation that could result in a penalty up to and including separation from the Chicago Police Department.”

Despite growing threats and pressure from the mayor’s office and CPD for officers to get the jab, the president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police John Catanzara spoke out against the mandate. After the city filed a complaint against Catanzara and the union for publicly opposing their medical coercion and “encouraging a work stoppage or strike,” a Cook County Circuit judge ordered Catanzara, whom Lightfoot accused of trying to “induce an insurrection,” to shut up and silenced him from offering any dissidence to the mandate until an Oct. 25 hearing on the matter.

“I think that the City has alleged a public interest in precluding Mr. Catanzara from making further comments encouraging his members to refuse to comply with the City’s policies so for that reason, I’ll enter a temporary restraining order requiring that Mr. Catanzara be precluded from making additional public comments,” Judge Cecilia A. Horan said. “Mr. Catanzara, you can talk to your friends, you can talk to your family, but I am talking about the YouTube things, and the various media things.”

Catanzara denied that he has ever “engaged in, supported, or encouraged a work stoppage,” but the union filed a lawsuit against the city for overlooking their bargaining power and instead “implement[ing] their unilateral changes.”

Chicago’s decision to get rid of police officers amid a crime spike follows an alarming trend where institutions that are essential to public health, safety, and travel are sacrificing their staff and ability to serve Americans on the altar of medically coercive vaccine mandates.

Police Powerless In Portland As Antifa Destroy $500K More In Property,"Police were powerless in Portland last week as Antifa anarchists caused another $500,000 worth of damage in their latest rampage.

The estimate, cited as a minimum by the Portland Police Bureau, came as a consequence of police powers being stripped before an annual demonstration was held in the name of Antifa comrade Sean Kealiher, who was killed by an SUV outside an anarchist bar in 2019.

“I’m concerned about the brazen criminal acts that took place downtown last night,” Police Chief Chuck Lovell said in a Wednesday statement. “I want to assure those who were victimized that investigations are underway, and we will do whatever we can to identify and arrest those who were responsible.”

No arrests have yet been made after about 100 activists attacked 35 locations including banks, retail stores, coffee shops, and government buildings.

Police were blocked from deploying crowd control measures such as pepper spray and rubber bullets due to legislation passed earlier this year.

“The reason that we did not intervene goes back to what we talked about last month with House Bill 2928 and the restrictions placed on us in a crowd control environment,” Portland Police Lt. Jake Jensen told residents on Thursday at a neighborhood meeting, as reported by KOIN.

While the law allows an exception during a riot, the damage was done before police managed to make the required formal declaration.

The damage that ensued was premeditated by Kealiher’s mother, a prison abolitionist who organized the night of rage out of protest over her son’s death two years ago. Kealiher was a young Antifa activist-turned-martyr who promoted domestic terrorism cloaked in so-called “social justice.”

“This is not a peaceful event,” Laura Kealiher wrote on Twitter ahead of the demonstrations, revealed in screenshots captured by The Post Millennial’s Andy Ngô. “Peace police will be kicked out period.”

Sean Kealiher was groomed by far-left extremists in Portland from a young age. For many years he was sent out as a fighter on the street. He urged for people to bomb schools & took credit for inspiring several acts of domestic terrorism. https://t.co/MBPDTnzoy5 — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) October 7, 2021

No arrests were made in Kealiher’s case, the exact circumstances of which remain unknown. According to The Intercept, an argument erupted between Kealiher and a group of his friends and another group outside the Cider Riot, a since-closed bar popular among Antifa activists. The opposing group eventually piled into an SUV, and after briefly turning away returned to hit Kealiher and ram the building. One of Kealiher’s friends pulled out a licensed handgun and started blasting the car as the driver started to reverse, fleeing the scene on foot with the rest of the passengers.

The police later recovered the vehicle but made no charges. Kealiher was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead after his friends chose not to call the authorities.

Portland’s disarming of police is by no means unique at a time of surging crime. Major cities from Minneapolis to Seattle opted to defund police, which led to massive spikes in emergency calls, causing jurisdictions now to reconsider the left-wing “solution” to community law enforcement.

Lawmakers in Oregon, however, have governed with such a cudgel against opposing values across the rest of the state’s conservative population that it’s ignited a movement among its rural counties to demand annexation to join Idaho.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/19/police-powerless-in-portland-as-antifa-destroy-500k-worth-of-property-in-latest-rampage/,2021-10-19
DC Police Say Department Gave 'Abortion Ultimatum' Upon Pregnancy,"At least two Washington, D.C., police officers said they were told to abort their unborn babies if they wanted to keep their jobs with the Metropolitan Police Department.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Chanel Dickerson first revealed the “abortion ultimatum” on Tuesday night during a community meeting. Dickerson, who is one of 10 black women suing the police department for $100 million for an unrelated discrimination and harassment case, said the pressure to abort her unborn child happened when she was an 18-year-old in the MPD cadet academy in 1988.

“My choice to have a baby was personal, and it should’ve been mine alone and not for an employer ultimatum,” Dickerson said. “I was told I had to have an abortion or be fired from the MPD cadet program.”

Dickerson chose her job over following through with her pregnancy. She told The Federalist that she resigned from the department in 1991 “but returned to MPD in 1994 as a civilian employee” before becoming a sworn officer in 1997.

Another DC police officer, Karen Arikpo, also disclosed to Fox 5 D.C. that the sergeant who was in charge of her 1997 recruit class with Dickerson told her to choose between keeping her baby or keeping her job. The sergeant reportedly no longer works for the department.

“So later that day, I went and told my class sergeant that I was pregnant. And she said I needed to have an abortion and she referred me to a doctor in D.C. to get it done,” Arikpo said.

After pressure from her employer, Arikpo kept her job instead of her baby. She told Fox 5 that she regrets that choice and has struggled with fertility ever since.

“I did this for a job,” she says. “And then to want kids and can’t have them. How do you tell people that?”

Arikpo called it “unfair” and explained that even with fertility treatments, she was never able to get pregnant again.

“It’s so unfair,” she said. “And now I’ve never been able to have a kid. All these years, I’ve tried and I’ve never been able to have a baby.”

D.C. police told Fox 5 that the academy’s current policy allows pregnant recruits to delay their training as cadets until after they have their baby.

“If a recruit gets pregnant while at the academy, she will be placed in a future class upon completion of her leave. If a cadet gets pregnant, she would continue the educational piece with modified PT per guidance of a medical professional,” the statement said.

The DC Metro Life Alliance slammed the department’s alleged behavior and said a mother should never have to choose between “her career in public service or her unborn child’s life.”

“The actions by Metropolitan Police Department officials showed callous disregard for human life, brutal discrimination towards their recruits, and contempt for the Washington DC community they have sworn to protect,” the statement said. “The careers of Assistant Chief Dickerson and Officer Arikpo were not expendable, neither were the lives of their unborn children, or the lives of any child, born or unborn. When the institutions that society is built upon cast off basic respect for the intrinsic value and dignity of human life in the womb, it spreads, and soon more and more lives can come to be seen as unworthy and expendable. It is extremely alarming that such a culture exists within the MPD, and we hope that District residents join our call for sincere apologies, swift amends, and transparent remediation from the Department.”

Multiple Cities Voting Whether To 'Defund The Police' Amid Crime Surge,"Voters in at least four cities are headed to the polls on Tuesday to determine whether they will “defund the police” amid rising urban crime rates. These referendums come on the heels of a growing crime surge in the United States, especially in urban areas.

While ballots in Austin, Texas, are asking voters to decide on an initiative that will actually increase staffing and law enforcement funding if passed, most of the “defund the police” proposals on the ballot in Cleveland, Denver, Minneapolis, and Albany, New York use vague language such as “police reform” to mask the policies’ true intent of dismantling law enforcement departments.

Minneapolis’s proposal is by far the largest and most expansive law enforcement overhaul on the ballot. If passed, City Question Two will restructure the Minneapolis charter to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a “Department of Public Safety” managed by the leftist mayor or a possibly more progressive replacement and the City Council. The Department of Public Safety would be staffed by mental health and social workers who would take a “comprehensive public health approach” to fighting crime and only include traditional police officers “if necessary.”

While some cities such as Los Angeles got away with defunding the police after referendums during the 2020 election, public support for pulling funding from law enforcement is down across the board. In Minneapolis, 55 percent of voters said they don’t support reducing the police force in the city.

A poll from the Pew Research Center published last week indicated that a rising number of Americans in general, 47 percent, actually want police spending in their areas to increase. That number is up 16 points from the beginning of the summer of rage in June 2020. Twenty-one percent of those who said they support funding hikes said the law enforcement spending should go up “a lot,” citing concerns about rising crime. Even 34 percent of Democrats admitted they wanted more funding for police moving forward.

Even some cities that don’t have specific referendums or proposals to yank money from law enforcement are set to vote on whether they will elect a mayor who supports “defunding the police.” In Boston, Atlanta, New York City, and Buffalo, New York, voters must choose between supporting a Democrat mayor who plans to rally around defunding the police in the name of racial justice or a Democrat mayor who has estranged themselves from the progressive policy.

Democrat mayoral candidate Annissa Essaibi George in Boston has openly supported adding hundreds of officers to the city’s police force to combat crime, but her progressive opponent Michelle Wu has already debuted a “public safety plan” that prohibits trained law enforcement officers from certain duties and hands them to “unarmed civilian personnel.”

Seattle Is One Election Away From Complete Leftist Anarchy,"Seattle may soon become the most prominent American city to officially embrace police and prison abolition. Voters are one election away from forever altering the promise of Seattle.

On November 2, voters may install the most radical group of politicians this city has ever seen. Given the current makeup of the council, that’s saying something.

Two high-profile campaigns feature self-described “police abolitionists” who won their primaries: council candidate Nikkita Oliver and city attorney candidate Nicole Thomas-Kennedy. The candidate for mayor, Lorena Gonzalez, is no friend to police, either. She advocated for a 50 percent cut to the police budget. She even wanted to fire white officers to ensure a more diverse, though dwindled, force.

This city is truly on the brink of chaos.

One Candidate’s Extremism

Oliver is a community organizer, lawyer, and activist running for one of two at-large council seats. She won the primary and now faces a Democrat pushing a public safety agenda. That’s not something Oliver can get behind. She was vital in helping create and maintain the deadly Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), where armed extremists took six city blocks of Seattle by force.

The current Seattle City Council is already hostile to police. It defunded the department by nearly 20 percent last year. Despite a surge in violence after the move, Oliver wants to cut more. She doesn’t merely identify as a police abolitionist; she even teaches a Seattle University course on the subject.

If elected, she vows to gut the Seattle Police Department budget by at least 50 percent. She would reallocate police funding to housing, child care, and community organizations. She wants to stop the police from handing out tickets and will push to end Seattle’s contract with the King County jail.

When talking with mainstream media, Oliver tries to tamp down her extremism. She told the Seattle Times in 2017 that she doesn’t want to abolish police or prisons immediately. She merely wants to create “a healthy society where human needs are met … and that would decrease a lot of the crime we see.” How sweet.

While the left-wing Times helps push this propaganda, Oliver doesn’t hide who she is on Twitter. “Seattle Police are tyrannical. Defund SPD by 100% at least and invest in communities,” she tweeted earlier this year.

She routinely calls police “murderers” and says violent riots are justified while downplaying them as mere property destruction. She even spreads wild conspiracy theories claiming police pretend to be Antifa to justify violence at protests.

Another Extremist Candidate

Oliver will have an ally in the mayor’s office if Lorena Gonzalez wins her race. Gonzalez is the current council president and has helped push her colleagues farther to the left. Although she’s not a police abolitionist, she was an early advocate of the defund-the-police movement. Gonzalez promised to cut 50 percent from local police but settled for less. She wasn’t happy about that compromise.

“I, and so many of my colleagues, did make a sincere commitment to want to defund the police department by at least 50%,” she told Vice News in late 2020. “But, as we know, city budgets are very complicated. Police budgets are no exception. And when we got in there, we realized that they had spent most of their budget for the year, and 50% would be hard to do without completely abolishing the police department.”

Gonzalez chided the police union for getting in the way of the council’s defund movement, almost as if she expected they would stand by as the council fired its members. Roughly 80 percent of the Seattle Police Department’s budget is personnel, making a 50 percent cut catastrophic to an already dangerously understaffed department. Gonzalez knew that.

Although she didn’t introduce the idea, Gonzalez reignited an illegal push to fire cops who are white. During the defund deliberations, then-police chief Carmen Best noted that newer recruits would be first to let go if they cut the budget. They were a significantly non-white officer class after considerable effort went into race-focused recruitment.

Gonzalez’s council colleague Lisa Herbold tried to fire officers out of order so they could avoid firing non-white people and, instead, fire the older white staff. It failed because of city regulations (and the law), but Gonzalez said in the new police contract, she’d push for this again. What do you think she’d do to the police force if she had power over the budget as mayor?

The Most Dangerous Candidate

Oliver and Gonzalez would destroy the Seattle Police Department if the council gave in to their wishes. But if police abolitionist Nicole Thomas-Kennedy wins the city attorney race, what’s left of Seattle would be destroyed.

Thomas-Kennedy does not hide who she is or what she believes. It’d be an admirable quality in a politician if her views weren’t so extreme, even by Seattle standards. She may be the most dangerous candidate in the country.

The abolitionist is running on a platform of ending most misdemeanor prosecutions. She argues the criminal justice system is racist and preys on the oppressed. She vows to dismantle the very office she’s running for, which would keep even more criminals out of jail and on the streets to victimize more residents. Her position doesn’t protect victims, it creates them by embracing anarchy and chaos.

Thomas-Kennedy believes property destruction by Black Lives Matter radicals is a “moral imperative.” She cheers on an Antifa arson against a juvenile detention center construction site. She labels this country “Amerikka” while calling cops “Nazis” and “oppressors.” Unsurprisingly, she backs defunding the police. She wants to abolish the police altogether.

Police Abolitionist May Win Election

Despite her radical views, Thomas-Kennedy won the primary, although it was in a three-way race. She now faces a moderate Republican. Two recent polls show she may actually have a viable path to victory.

Strategies 360/KOMO News polling shows neither Thomas-Kennedy nor opponent Ann Davison cracking 20 percent support. Davison’s prospects fare much better in a recent poll by left-wing Northwest Progressive Institute, earning 43 perent to Thomas-Kennedy’s 24 percent.

So how’s this good news for the police abolitionist? Both polls show a remarkably high number of undecided voters. This suggests Seattle voters may be reluctant to support a Republican, Davison, even when she’s up against an extremist. Worse, it could indicate they haven’t yet even looked into the candidates.

You can’t be undecided if you know what Thomas-Kennedy stands for: you either lean into the chaos she would bring, or you’d be repulsed by it. Either scenario can give Thomas-Kennedy enough support to pull off a victory. How utterly terrifying.

Seattle is truly at a crossroads. We’re on year two of a historic surge in violent crime. We have the fewest number of deployable officers since the 1980s. Our current criminal justice system — no matter what Thomas-Kennedy claims — rarely punishes criminals. Instead, they’re released with a slap on the wrist or unenforceable demands that they seek treatment. And homelessness has never been worse.

Voters in Seattle must vote like the city’s future is on the line — because it is.

Minneapolis Voters Reject Leftist Push To Defund And Replace Police,"Minneapolis voters overwhelmingly defeated an amendment on Tuesday aiming to defund the Minneapolis Police Department and replace trained law enforcement officers with social workers.

Question Two asked voters whether they supported an overhaul of the city’s law enforcement system by replacing the MPD with a “Department of Public Safety.” Under the proposal, which was created to dismantle policing following the death of George Floyd in May 2020, leftist Mayor Jacob Frey or his significantly more progressive competitor and the City Council would manage the DPS. The DPS would be staffed by mental health and social workers who would take a “comprehensive public health approach” to fighting crime and only include traditional police officers “if necessary.”

Polling suggested that 55 percent of voters in the blue city were not keen on reducing the number of officers in their areas, especially due to a national rise in urban crime. That number rose to 56 percent or 80,506 voters who were against the proposal after all 136 Minneapolis precincts reported on election day. Despite the city’s leftist track record, only 62,813 voters, or 43 percent, said they wanted to see the police department go.

Minneapolis voters may have hesitated to let go of their city’s law enforcement, but voters in Austin gladly voted against a measure that would have increased the city’s police staffing to better address crime.

A poll from the Pew Research Center published last week indicated that a rising number of Americans in general, 47 percent, want police spending in their areas to increase. That number is up 16 points from the beginning of the summer of rage in June 2020.

Twenty-one percent of those who said they support funding hikes said the law enforcement spending should go up “a lot,” citing concerns about rising crime. Even 34 percent of Democrats agreed they wanted more funding for police moving forward.

"‘Thin Blue Line’ Writer Mike Baron Talks Comics, Police, And Woke Politics","Comic creators are finally pushing back against the subversive wokeness and identity politics ripping the medium and our culture apart. Mike Baron, with his new pro-police comic, “The Thin Blue Line,” is one of them.

You may not be familiar with Mike Baron’s name, but you will have likely enjoyed the influence of his work. Baron is a two-time Eisner Award winner who worked for DC Comics and Marvel and had a prolific run with “The Punisher” during the 1980s and 1990s. During his career, he covered everything from “Star Wars” to “The Flash” and “Batman.”

An example of Baron’s influence can be seen in the hit Netflix series version of “The Punisher.” Micro, the orthodox Jewish hacker, is a Baron creation, as is the anti-security state narrative. Indeed, some of the most woke comics creators today, like Gail Simone, cite Baron’s comics as significant influences.

It can’t escape the notice of normies and comics fans alike that the western comic book publishing industry seems to ripen more towards its destruction every day. Legacy characters like Superman or Robin get replaced with hollowed-out woke versions. At the same time, the storylines they appear in are sanitized and boring.

The industry continues to fall further apart as Japanese Manga sales entirely supplant it. The bulk of the sales in the western “comics industry” are now Scholastic books for 8-year-olds. Things are so bad major creators have left for the life raft called Substack. There are even whispers that one of the big two, DC and Marvel, will stop publishing comics altogether in a few years.

So it’s a big deal when notable creators like Baron get involved to right the ship and make comics fun again. In an interview with The Federalist, Baron discussed his latest pro-law enforcement comics project, the influence of wokeness on the dying comics industry, and his legendary career in comics.

Pischke: So, Mike, tell people a little bit about yourself. How did you get into comics?

Baron: Well, I always wanted to write comics, since picking up an “Uncle Scrooge” in Mitchell, South Dakota, where I grew up. For seven years, I worked on newspapers. I moved back to Madison [Wisconsin] and in 1981, I met Steve Rude. We were just in the right place at the right time because Capital City Distribution, the second-largest distributor of comic books in the world, decided to publish their own line.

So, I went home, and I brainstormed Nexus, the reluctant executioner of mass murderers. They published “Nexus” with Capital City Comics and we were off and running. And on the strength of that book, which spread like wildfire throughout the industry, I was asked to write “The Punisher” (at Marvel) and to write “Flash” at DC, among many other titles. And I had a great career in comics.

Pischke: So, you are now doing “Thin Blue Line,” a pro-law enforcement story? What motivated you to do a pro-cop comic book story?

Baron: One day, watching these riots that swept through America last year. You would see the same thing on channel after channel; city in flames, looters running in and out. Some idiot addressing the camera upfront saying, “These mostly peaceful protests are for a righteous cause.” And you see politician after politician: “We must defund the police.”

Since they declared war on the police, homicides are up 100 percent in every blue city. Rapes, robberies are up over 100 percent in every one of those cities that attacked their own police department. Now they have these vaccine mandates, they want to force everyone to get a vaccine.

And police officers and first responders and nurses and doctors are walking off the job all over the country, leaving hospitals and police departments understaffed, even worse than they were.

So, I decided, well, you know, this story needs to be told because it’s certainly not being told in any of the popular entertainment we’re seeing these days.

It’s about two police officers trying to survive a night in a riot-torn city. It will be familiar to everybody who’s aware of the news. But I must stress, it’s not a polemic at all, it’s not a lecture at all. It’s one of the best stories I’ve ever written, it’s gripping, it’ll grab you by the throat on the first page, and you won’t be able to put it down.

It’s just solid drama. And it snaps and clicks from panel to panel. That’s what I try to do with my entertainment. No wasted space, no boring spots, just pure entertainment. It just happens to have police who are cast in a sympathetic light. Because you’re either for the rule of law or you’re not. Civilization depends on the rule of law.

Pischke: You’ve been a big critic of the comics industry today, how is it different from back when you worked at the big two?

Baron: My experience may have been unique, but I had virtually no editorial interference in anything I wrote at Marvel or DC. It was a different world back then. Dennis O’Neil was one of my editors. Archie Goodwin was one of my editors. These were giants who grew up in the comic industry.

I pick up a couple of comics lately, to see how they’re doing, and I am appalled. Captain America — I bought two issues that were years apart. They were both written by Ta Nehisi-Coates and neither one contained any entertainment value whatsoever.

Pischke: What about the media covering comics?

Baron: What I see shown in the comic press is dreary social justice warrior nonsense, where they’re lecturing or condescending to the reader and scolding them for their prejudices and making bold statements of virtue. But superheroes have always stood for what’s right.

And they should. But the first rule of comics, and this is something they seem to have forgotten, is people buy them to be entertained. And that’s — if they’re not entertained, they’re not going to turn the page.

And what I see of modern comics today seems completely taken over by frivolous identity politics. It doesn’t appeal to anyone outside a very narrow fringe. I think a lot of these people are just writing the comics for themselves to get something off their chest. And they’ve forgotten how to entertain.

Pischke: They also seem obsessed with racial or ethnic identities.

Baron: I talked about how you entertain the audience, but the reader wants to have somebody with whom they can identify. For most people, they think Superman should appeal to everyone. But it seems to me that the majors are hiring writers not based on their accomplishments or ability to entertain, but to check off boxes on a checklist of certain characteristics that they want to make a point about.

Pischke: I think that is a fair point. If you wanted to earn a big title, editors would choose folks with some talent with a proven track record. But today, there are creatives that are put in charge of huge projects, like Alyssa Wong, who’s pretty new to the industry, being put in charge of “Shang-Chi” and “Iron Fist.”

Baron: Yeah, I bought one of those and no entertainment value. And there’s another thing that bugs me, this doesn’t apply just to Alyssa Wong. There are no realistic martial arts portrayed in any place.

And this has always bugged me. And one of the things I’ve prided myself on is including martial arts in a dynamic and realistic manner in my books. And that includes “The Punisher” and especially “The Badger,” and the Bruce Lee comic that I wrote, where you see a technique unfolding.

Pischke: For sure, you can see that, especially in your “Punisher” series. The action in those comics is very grounded in realism, how firearms get used, for example.

Baron: Oh yeah. We had to get the hardware correct or we would hear about it.

Pischke: So how are you funding “Thin Blue Line”? I hear a focus of your fundraising is to help “adopt-a-cop.”

Baron: Well, yeah, we’re working to fund this book. This story is dynamite. It’s the best story you’re going to read all year. It’s up on Indiegogo, “Thin Blue Line.”

With the Indiegogo goals, if we reach $20,000, I’m going to dye my hair blue. At $30,000, I’ll dye my hair green. $40,000 is a mohawk. And if we reach $50,000, which is the level we need to do to adopt a cop, I’m going to shave my skull.

With adopt a cop, we’re going to pay for a police officer to attend a jujitsu academy to learn techniques to subdue people without hurting them or himself. Joe is a master of jujitsu. He’s been training for many years. He’s a veteran. And I mentioned that we like to show realistic martial arts in the book, and you’ll see plenty of that in “Thin Blue Line.”

Pischke: Wow, that sounds like an honorable thing to do. But what does your wife, Ann, think of this plan?

Baron: (Laughing) At first she was, “No you’re not.”

Then eventually after thinking about it, she says, “All right. I’ll help.”

School Board Calls Police Over Lawyer’s Maskless Lollipop Eating,"The Lodi School District official who asked police to respond to an orderly school board meeting earlier this month said police presence would make a board member “feel better.”

“We would like to have a Lodi officer up at the district office,” Maureen Palmer, administrative assistant to District Administrator Vince Breunig says in a 911 call November 8 to the Columbia County Sheriff’s Department. The audio was obtained by Empower Wisconsin.

“He does not have to come lights and sirens, we just want to have him present at our board meeting the way it’s going,” Palmer says.

“Is it becoming disorderly? Do you feel like it might?” the dispatcher asks.

It wasn’t, but district officials felt like it could, according to Palmer.

“We would just like his presence here, just come and be present for a while,” Palmer added.

Lawyer Representing Concerned Parents

By all accounts, however, the meeting wasn’t disorderly, and it never got that way. It just included parents concerned about the district’s stringent mask and quarantine policies expressing their thoughts during the public comment period.

Attorney Brent Eisberner, at the request of some of those concerned parents, spoke at the school board meeting. The parents had started a GoFundMe account to hire him. Other parents who had signed up to speak “donated” their time to the attorney. He told the board his legal opinion: the district’s policies were excessive and discriminatory and could lead to a lawsuit.

District residents also were concerned about the board’s plan to change the public comment period, limiting time allowed to speak and prohibiting comment from individuals from outside the district — like Eisberner. The board and district educrats didn’t like what they were hearing. So they called 911.

Police Officer Responds to Request

They wanted police presence. They got it. Dispatch sent an officer out. He stood in the back while the meeting continued. He was very present. Eisberner said it was all part of the board’s intimidation tactics, and a misuse of law enforcement.

“I think it’s an incredible waste of resources,” the attorney said. “It shows in my mind they didn’t like what was being said at the meeting and wanted an officer standing in the back of the meeting so they could say, ‘Look at what we can do. We can get the force of government to intimidate parents.’”

Palmer made it clear she didn’t want to draw any unnecessary attention, at least until the officer arrived.

“Again, he doesn’t have to come lights and sirens, just come and have his presence here would make a board member feel better,” she told the dispatcher.

Eisberner said he was surprised the dispatcher agreed to send the officer. There was no disorderly behavior by any of the attendees.

Not Disorderly, Just Unmasked

Lodi School Board President Adam Steinberg grew upset because Eisberner wasn’t wearing a mask. The attorney then put one on. Steinberg, according to a witness, also was concerned that Eisberner was unmasked while eating a lollipop.

“He went up with the lollipop in his mouth and said he is eating. Therefore, a mask is not required. At this point, I was standing in the doorway and heard the board assistant call the police. Apparently, eating the lollipop was the last straw,” the witness said.

“Nobody was unruly. Everyone was polite. No threats were made. The attorney said he was representing parents. Parents, clearly donated their time to him. There was no reason to be concerned for safety. Yet they called 911. Not a non-emergency number but 911 over someone escalating a situation to eating a lollipop.”

The board approved the public comment measure, limiting the time allowed to address the board at meetings.

“If the board doesn’t like what you’re talking about, they can stop you. That’s not my vision of what public comment is meant for,” Eisberner said.

Police Cam Catches MSNBC Producer Following Jury In Rittenhouse Case,"Recently released police body camera footage shows MSNBC producer James J. Morrison admitting to following a jury vehicle during the Kyle Rittenhouse case at the behest of Irene Byon, a New York-based booking producer for NBC News.

The footage begins when Officer Jerel Jones-Denson of the Kenosha Police Department pulls over Morrison for a red light violation and asks if he lives in the area before inquiring, “Were you following a vehicle?” Morrison explains that he is a producer for MSNBC and said he “was being called by New York.”

He continues to explain that someone from NBC’s New York office told him that “these might be the people that you need to follow,” in reference to a vehicle that was carrying members of the jury from the Rittenhouse trial.

Jones-Denson clarifies and asks, “New York told you to follow a vehicle?” to which Morrison responds “yes.” Morrison also tells the officer that he was being “discreet” and wasn’t trying to “talk with anybody,” but was instead trying to “find a location.”

Morrison later calls New York-based NBC producer Irene Byon and puts the police officer on the phone. In her exchange with Jones, Byon struggles to explain why she had told Morrison to follow the vehicle, repeatedly tripping over her words before telling him the MSNBC staffers were hoping to “find any leads … about the case” and discover “where people involved in the trial are positioned.”

Byon also explains “we had our people positioned in different areas of the courthouse” so they could follow those involved in the case. Jones-Denson then chastised Byon, telling her to stop telling reporters to follow those involved with the case, saying this “put people in dangerous positions” in reference to Morrison’s alleged violation of traffic laws.

Before this body camera footage was released, the incident prompted Judge Bruce Schroeder of the Rittenhouse case to ban MSNBC from the courtroom. The media company has a history of doxxing normal people.

What's Behind The Massive Spike In Violence Inside U.S. Public Schools,"Ask any public high school student: violent in-school fights are on the rise and discipline is on the decline. Just consider one public high school: Madison East in Madison, Wisconsin.

In late September, local media reported a series of “disturbing” cell phone videos depicting vicious fights and beatings occurring in class and on school grounds over the course of several days. Then, several hundred students walked out of school twice in one week protesting the school’s sexual harassment policies.

The protest apparently spilled over to other local high schools, resulting in marauding groups of students causing “harm to others,” damaging “property in the downtown area,” and publicly “calling out” suspected sexual harassers, according to an email from one of the area school districts.

A few days later, on Oct. 20, 10 police officers responded to fights in a “massive crowd” of more than 100 students at Madison East. On Nov. 8, more than 15 police officers responded to what the media described as a “melee” in which five students were taken to the hospital. The next day, more than one-third of all students stayed home out of fear.

In all, Madison police were called to Madison East and its “surrounding area” 63 times during the first few months of the school year.

Madison East is no outlier. A simple Google search reveals similar headlines from around the country: “Woman with gun arrested as IMPD breaks up large fight at George Washington High School” in Indiana, “Big brawl At Woodhaven High School results in minor injuries” in Michigan, “Police investigating after large fight in parking lot of West Mecklenburg High School” in North Carolina, and “Reynolds Middle School is shutting down in-person learning for 3 weeks to address student fights, misbehavior” in Oregon. All these stories originated during the same week.

So what could be causing such a spike? Or perhaps more frighteningly, is this a new normal? Many factors may be contributing to this upward trend, but a few probable culprits require serious scrutiny.

Missed Socialization From COVID Closures

Even before COVID, the trend was towards more violence in schools. The number of violent incidents on public school campuses increased a staggering 185 percent from 2016 to 2019, according to a recent study. But following months of lockdowns, closed schools, and virtual learning, this trend accelerated as kids returned to school.

For example, the National Association of School Resource Officers reported a tripling of gun-related incidents in schools between August and October 2021, compared to the same three-month period in 2019. One Florida principal, at a recent national school safety conference, summed up what many schools are experiencing: “Some students, who had no history of issues, suddenly started aggressive behavior when our high school resumed last August.”

Perhaps this should be no surprise. With students returning to school after a year of missed socialization, and the emotional damage it wrought, it seems only natural that student-on-student violence would increase.

Less Discipline and Fewer School Resource Officers

In addition to COVID policies and their impact on socialization, schools are contributing to the problem by intentionally weakening discipline policies. Largely in the name of political correctness, school districts around the nation have been working to reduce racial disparities in suspensions.

Based on the notion that any difference in suspension rates among students of different races is inherently racist, suspension rates around the nation have declined significantly in recent years, with little evidence of improved student behavior. Previous research by our organization, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, has found that declining suspension rates are directly correlated to students feeling less safe in schools.

Exacerbating the decision to reduce suspensions, many school districts have also cut ties with local law enforcement by removing School Resource Officers (SROs). SROs are uniformed police officers specially trained, hired, and paid by police departments to work in public schools. Since the death of George Floyd, at least 33 public school districts (mostly in large cities), including the district covering Madison East, ended their relationships with local law enforcement and removed SROs.

Anti-Police, Pro-Riot Rhetoric

Relatedly, anti-police curriculum is increasing. Nationwide, examples abound of teachers portraying police officers as racist murderers, displaying banners such as “F-CK THE POLICE,” and even teaching children as young as three that police are racist because a “white-supremacy fairy” whispers evil thoughts into their ears.

On the other hand, students are taught to praise lawless protesters and looters. One teacher was fired after he was caught on tape praising the violent and extreme political movement Antifa. Another public school teacher justified riots as an “uprising” and labeled rioters as “freedom fighters.”

Yet another teacher took to Facebook to express his desire for rioting and looting to come to his hometown, posting “Burn down the entire city as well!” and later “I mean what I said. Loot and burn it down!” Another teacher was fired for doing the opposite: criticizing looting and rioting in Chicago.

Tied up in this curricula is also an increasing call for students to embrace “activism.” For example, the “BLM at School” curriculum, which is taught in many public schools, promotes a “national uprising” and student-led protests.

Portland public schools even promoted multiple “mock protests” with children as young as five raising their “black power” fists, middle schoolers calling for defunding the police, and high school students demanding reparations while marching through “the whitest part of the city.” Teach For America, a nonprofit aimed at putting well-educated teachers in urban school districts, claims that “youth-led activism,” and not high-achieving students, “is key to building a better world.”

This is a dangerous cocktail: missed socialization due to lockdowns, falling suspension rates, sidelining and demonizing police, praising looters, and encouraging activism. When these policies are considered together, perhaps it is no surprise that our public schools are becoming more violent.

One silver lining is that each of these policies can be reversed. At bottom, this is a matter of school policy. Nothing inherently wrong with our kids. It is therefore time for education policymakers to abandon their current anti-authority and anti-discipline policies, and return schools to what they should be: safe learning environments for our children.

Jussie Smollett Is The Death Knell In The ‘Racist Trump Supporters’ Myth,"Even though Jussie Smollett has been found guilty of staging a homophobic and racist assault against himself and lying about it, an overlooked tragic injustice of the three-year saga is that he wrongfully gets to be the most famous person associated with a plot that he cribbed from untold numbers of lesser-known people before him.

The story he told about an innocent minority violently attacked by Trump supporters (i.e. white men) was done countless times before he did it in January 2019. And as in Smollett’s case, they were either proved to be fake, or they went unresolved after the supposed victims curiously stopped talking with police.

It’s a fairytale that’s been told time and time again by leftists who throw a fit when things aren’t going their way.

A day after the 2016 presidential election, a female Muslim student at San Diego State University claimed to police that she had been assaulted and robbed by two men who “made comments about President-Elect Trump and the Muslim community.” The student also said her car had been stolen, apparently as part of the attack.

Two months later, police dropped the investigation because the “victim” no longer wanted to cooperate. And her car hadn’t been stolen after all. She told police she had simply forgotten where she parked it. (It was, no doubt, purely coincidental that the student was a member of the Muslim Student Association, which had been planning an upcoming protest of Trump’s election.)

The exact same day as that fake attack, another Muslim woman at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette claimed that two white men had assaulted her, robbed her, and snatched a hijab from her head. She described one of them as wearing a white Trump hat. A day later, investigators said she confessed to having fabricated the entire incident.

On Dec. 1, 2016, Yasmin Seweid, 18, told New York City police that three drunken white guys had taunted her about Trump’s election victory and tried to pull a hijab from her head on the subway as other passengers watched without intervening. “It made me really sad after when I thought about it,” she told the New York Daily News. “People were looking at me and looking at what was happening and no one said a thing. They just looked away.” She said the men called her a terrorist and told her to “get the hell out of the country.”

A month later, she confessed that none of it was real. “Nothing happened, and there was no victim,” New York police said. The Daily News thereafter reported that Seweid had made up the story “because she didn’t want to get in trouble for breaking her curfew after being out late drinking with friends.”

(Take solace, however, in knowing that Seweid’s parents, disappointed by her hoax, reportedly punished her by making her shave her head.)

If Smollett’s case was at all a surprise, it should only be in that anyone took so seriously a lie that had been told so many times before.

In November 2016, immediately after Trump’s election, The Indianapolis Star reported that St. David’s Episcopal Church of Bean Blossom, Indiana, had been vandalized with graffiti on its walls.

In black spray paint were a swastika, “Heil Trump,” and “Fag church,” an apparent reference to the church’s reputation within the community for welcoming gays.

Six months later, 26-year-old gay man George Nathaniel Stang, an organist at St. David’s, admitted to police that he was the perpetrator. He had sprayed the graffiti because he was “disappointed in and fearful of the outcome of the national election.”

On Nov. 3, 2018, a synagogue in Brooklyn, New York, was defaced with graffiti spelling out “Die Jew Rats,” “End it Now,” and “Jew Better Be Ready.”

The incident understandably shook the community, given that it happened just one week after a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue wherein 11 people died (a tragedy that was also falsely blamed on Trump). Then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, denounced the attack on the Brooklyn synagogue.

“The disgusting rhetoric and heinous violence in this nation has reached a fever pitch and is ripping at the fabric of America,” Cuomo said. State-level Democrat lawmaker Jim Gaughran wrote on Twitter that the apparent hate crime highlighted “the need for a change in our current political climate. Hate, bigotry, and fear-mongering have become all too common in today’s society and that needs to change.”

Police two days later found the suspect, a 30-year-old blonde, blue-eyed, white male who confessed that he had been inspired to act by President Trump. Wait, no, that’s not right. My mistake! In reality, after reviewing surveillance video that clearly showed the perpetrator, police detained 26-year-old James Polite, a black gay male who, as fate would have it, was highly active in local Democratic politics.

Polite was the exact opposite of the type of person we’re told to expect this kind of thing from. He had worked as an intern in the office of Democrat Christine Quinn, the very loud lesbian who in 2013 lost her bid for city mayor and who had served as New York City Council speaker. In a delicious twist to the plot, Polite’s area of responsibility as an intern in Quinn’s office included oversight of local hate crimes.

You can read about all of these and more in my book “Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People.”

Smollett is not an original. He is not, as he claimed during his trial, a “black Cary Grant.” He is not, as he claimed before he faced criminal charges, “the gay Tupac.”

Smollett is a fraud, but hopefully now everyone knows that the tale about Trump supporters (white men) wildly attacking minorities is fraudulent too.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/10/jussie-smollett-is-the-death-knell-in-the-racist-trump-supporters-myth/,2021-12-10
"Hong Kong News Outlet Forced To Close Following Police Raid, Arrests","Image Credit Diego Delso/Wikimedia Commons

Hong Kong pro-democracy news outlet Stand News was forced to shut down on Wednesday following a police raid and the arrest of several staff members on suspicion of “seditious publication” offenses. The move comes amid a crackdown on press freedoms by communist Chinese authorities.

According to Hong Kong Free Press, “[O]ver 200 national security police officers were deployed to raid the Kwun Tong offices of the non-profit online outlet in the early hours of Wednesday,” with authorities arresting seven people linked to the outlet “on suspicion of breaching the colonial-era Crimes Ordinance by conspiring to publish seditious publications.” At least four current staff members were also taken into custody for further questioning.

The arrests included Stand News’s former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and former acting chief editor Patrick Lam, who were “officially charged with allegedly conspiring to publish seditious publications” by a city court on Thursday. Both Pui-kuen and Lam have also been denied bail, with acting chief magistrate Peter Law saying that “he was not satisfied that there were sufficient grounds for believing that they would not continue to commit acts endangering national security if bail was extended.”

While speaking at a Wednesday press conference on the matter, senior superintendent of the police national security department Steve Li claimed that the arrested individuals held “important roles in the company’s editorial direction and strategy” and accused Stand News of publishing “seditious materials” aimed at fostering hatred toward the communist government.

“These cases have been to court. Did we see this happening? Is there evidence? These were examples of sedition,” Li said. “There is strong evidence showing that this online media and other so-called ‘international front’ [activists] conspired to incite hatred towards the government, and endangered national security through its platform.”

Li also denied accusations that the government is working to cripple press freedoms, claiming that police are “not targeting the reporter, the media, just the national security offences.”

The accelerated crackdown on pro-democracy outlets in Hong Kong has since sparked outrage among the world community, with Dan Kubiske, the co-chair of the Society of Professional Journalists’ International Community, calling the arrests an attack “on press freedom under the guise of national security.”

“SPJ stands with our brave colleagues in Hong Kong who continue to believe in the right of news organizations to be free from government control,” Kubiske in a statement. “We call on the Hong Kong government to abide by the 1997 treaty and end its persecution of journalists who do what free and independent journalists are supposed to do – hold public figures to account, ask questions and provide their consumers with truthful information.”

Jan. 6 And The Curse Of Whataboutism,"A year on, there are numerous valid and important questions about what happened on Jan. 6 and why. There are questions to be asked about the decisions that led directly to what was a peaceful political protest turning into a violent riot. The language used by its popularizers as an attempted coup — insurrection, threat to democracy, seconds from losing the country, etc. — are all meant to elide this point.

Time’s Molly Ball says it here: without a massive breakdown in policing and security, this would be a day no one remembered.

I’ve thought a lot about this: Was Jan. 6 an attempted coup or just a police breakdown? If the police had been properly prepared, Jan. 6 would have been just another rally, a day no one remembers. — Molly Ball (@mollyesque) January 6, 2022

So the questions that present themselves are: why were Capitol Police so unprepared for a rally that made crystal clear its intentions to go to the Hill? Why did multiple requests and offers of additional support go rebuffed? Why do so many of the agitators, some of them armed, remain free and at large instead of under arrest? Why were so many individuals allowed into the building without being stopped? And — and this one bothers me most of all — what can the possible excuse be, in the most surveilled area in the most surveilled American city, for not knowing who the attempted pipe bomber is after all this time?

A commission that was interested in the answers to these questions could be valuable, even worthwhile, in a way that nearly every after-action commission is not. But the unconstitutional January 6th Commission, which exists primarily as a way to channel Liz Cheney’s score-settling and Nancy Pelosi’s thin reed of 2022 hopes, is not interested in any of this. They’re not even interested in ensuring the implementation of the Inspector General’s report on Capitol Police failures, which they are still ignoring.

The “flash reports” authored by the IG’s office over the past year detail suggestions for security enhancements from their review into the failures that led to a crowd of pro-Trump protestors overruning police and storming Capitol grounds. In the eighth and final report, the office revealed that out of the 104 recommendations only 30 have been fully implemented by the Capitol Police department.

Why is that? Well, it’s because they aren’t actually interested in preventing another violent riot at the Capitol or talking about policing or decision-making or even security. The whole point of the commission is to be used as a cudgel against all Republicans and turn them into an actual terroristic threat to the future of the country. And because they were hoping, somehow, to find a way to go directly after Donald Trump (impeach him again!) and a bunch of his friends and supporters who matter more to them than random protesters from middle America. Unhappily for them, they’ve basically been left with harassing Seb Gorka for his texts. At least they have the power to get CNN to set up for American Idol in Statuary Hall. And don’t worry about their safety, no American citizens are allowed in the Capitol because, you know, COVID.

This is unsurprising from the partisan left. Of course, there has also been a ridiculous trend on the part of some commentators to go along with the idea that Jan. 6 is immune to whataboutism — that it stands alone as an assault on American values, government buildings, and representative government. It requires such egregious mental leaps of logic that it ignores all that came before such a date, and the very evident trendlines that led the nation to this point. For them, Jan. 6 exists in amber, created out of thin air, as opposed to being the predictable result of ever-increasing tendencies toward justified violence to achieve righteous ends, as permitted and even lauded by our media and our elites for years.

A year ago, I wrote this about the consequences of the Capitol assault — it ended up being one of the last pieces Rush Limbaugh read on air:

The first is a comment from an apolitical friend who wandered into the room where the roiling crowd was on the screen in the early afternoon yesterday: “Is that Black Lives Matter?” No, it’s not — but also, it is. An apolitical viewer of the summer of 2020 would learn one distinct lesson: If you want to be heard, if you want to be listened to, you need to go into the streets, make a ruckus, set things on fire, and tear down icons of America. This disrespect will be welcomed, hailed, and supported if your cause is just and your motives are righteous. Just about everyone who showed up on Capitol Hill yesterday believed that about why they were there. The only difference between the horned man standing in the Senate chair or the smiling man hauling the speaker’s podium out the door and the fellow who attempted to tear down Andrew Jackson’s statue or the criminal who set fire to St. John’s Church is a matter of jersey color. The second is that blaming this on Donald Trump isn’t just too simplistic, it’s whistling past the graveyard of our norms. Of course, he egged on his crowd to go up to the Capitol and be loud and irritating. But he didn’t tell them to break down doors and crash the gates, and he didn’t need to. Blaming this on Trump assumes this type of attitude will go away when Trump himself does. That’s way too easy — it’s wishful thinking. The iconoclasm of the right is a real development, and it is here to stay. You’ll wish for the old man in the tricorn hat waving a Cato Constitution when you see the new right blasting statues with graffiti… The obvious result of yesterday’s conflagration will be a feeble attempt at a purge by the Mitt Romneys, Liz Cheneys, and Adam Kinzingers (ha!) of the GOP. This will fail because their constituency is not just outnumbered, it is utterly dominated by the populist iconoclasts. A party of the right that rejects the mob of people who spent their hard-earned, working-class money to drive to Washington, D.C., and wave a flag as deplorables will never win, or deserve to, any more than a party of the left could reject naming something Black Lives Matter plaza. What will happen next is obvious: A total crushing, anti-free speech effort that treats Trump-supporting groups like Branch Davidians. An effort to restore the fundamentally unserious neocons as the voice of reason in the room. A hardening of the bounds of the People’s House to keep people away from politicians. A use of any levers of government power — including audits, regulation, and lawfare — to harass conservatives now categorized as seditionists and terrorists by the incoming president who falsely claims to want to unite the country. And above all, a doubling down on all the policies and efforts put in place to crush exactly the type of people who showed up at the Capitol yesterday in a foolish, desperate attempt to make themselves heard.

The January 6th Commission will solve nothing. The speeches today will only embolden more iconoclasm as valid partisanship. Kamala Harris has already compared Jan. 6 to 9/11 and the attack on Pearl Harbor today, which no one honest actually thinks. The CNN townhall tonight should be amazing. But as John Davidson writes: The storming of the U.S. Capitol should have been a wake-up call against tolerating political violence. Instead, it’s become cheap propaganda:

The Washington Post came out with a poll recently showing 34 percent of Americans now believe that violence against the government can be justified under certain circumstances, a sharp increase from earlier polls that asked the same question. It should be 100 percent. Americans schooled in the Declaration of Independence should know about the right of revolution: that a free people have the right — a duty, even — to revolt against a tyrannical regime and establish a new political order, waging a war of revolution if need be. Under conditions of tyranny, of course violence against the government is justified. But that’s probably not what those 34 percent meant. Short of revolution, political violence in a free society should be absolutely forbidden. When it arises, it should be crushed by overwhelming force. That’s what should have happened on Jan. 6, and also what should have happened in cities across the country in the months leading up to it… Everything, in fact, that has happened since Jan. 6 is in some ways worse than what happened that day — not for the families who lost loved ones, of course, but for the nation at large. What should have been an object lesson and a cautionary tale about what happens when you turn a blind eye to political violence and civil unrest — eventually it becomes endemic and the other side uses it, too — was instead turned into a cudgel. Instead of admitting that their tacit support for the BLM riots might have opened the door for the Capitol riot, Democrats and the media decided to lump all Republicans in with the Jan. 6 rioters. They are now conflating rather mundane GOP-led state election reforms with the so-called “insurrection,” as if duly elected lawmakers making laws are no different than mobs storming past police barriers. This isn’t just an absurd argument, it’s also deleterious for the country because it trivializes what happened. If every Republican is an “insurrectionist” because of Jan. 6, as Democrats and the media claim, then Jan. 6 must not have been a big deal. We need not be overly concerned about it or learn any lessons from it.

The lessons remain unlearned. The latest polls indicate more Democrats denied Trump won in 2016 than Republicans today deny that Biden won in 2020. If you care about the country, that might look like a disturbing trend encompassing the whole country, not just the rubes.

But if you’re a mindless partisan, that’s just some inconvenient whataboutism you don’t even have the challenge of dismissing so long as you’re only on CNN. Which reminds me, it’s time for the absolutely sincere candle-light vigil organized by the Antifa activist behind disruptive protests at Bush and Trump’s inaugurations and more recently targeting a Senator’s wife.

It’s a good thing that good old Joe Biden, Mr. Civility and Normalcy, is back in charge.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/06/jan-6-and-the-curse-of-whataboutism/,2022-01-06
Why Are Democrats Ignoring The Failures By Capitol Police On Jan. 6?,"Image Credit YouTube/Photo

Why are Democrats ignoring the failures of the U.S. Capitol Police force during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021?

As one TIME national political correspondent noted in a Twitter thread this week, Capitol Police played a large role on Jan. 6, but most on the left are not addressing it.

“I’ve thought a lot about this: Was Jan. 6 an attempted coup or just a police breakdown? If the police had been properly prepared, Jan. 6 would have been just another rally, a day no one remembers,” she mused on Twitter.

It’s a question that has run through many minds, but few, especially those on the left, have dared to ask it aloud. Certainly, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s Jan. 6 committee hasn’t addressed it.

Capitol Police officials and even D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser have admitted that Jan. 6 exposed key failures of the law enforcement department, but so far, the biggest changes have occurred because more than 100 officers left the Capitol force since the riot. Their departures left the force depleted by nearly 400 officers short of what is required.

As ranking member of the Committee on House Administration Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., noted in a memo earlier this week, the Capitol Police Inspector General issued more than 100 recommendations to be adopted by the law enforcement officers following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but “most have not been implemented” by the administration.

“The Capitol Police IG has said that the Capitol Police still doesn’t have adequate training, intelligence gathering, and [the] culture change it needs to protect members of staff in the Capitol as a whole,” Davis noted in a Republican House leadership press call on Monday.

Pelosi, in addition to completely ignoring Republican members’ questions about Capitol Police, has also failed to encourage House members to hold an oversight hearing for the new Chief of Capitol Police Thomas Manger, who assumed his position in August of 2021. Her appointee for sergeant at arms has also failed to answer questions about the Capitol Police breakdown on Jan. 6.

Corporate media aren’t off the hook either. Instead of scrutinizing why key changes meant to reinforce the strength of Capitol Police have yet to be implemented, they have propped up coverage of the overtly partisan Jan. 6 committee and smeared Republicans as “domestic terrorists.” Leftist-controlled press rushed to amplify clips of a teary-eyed Harry Dunn testifying about Jan. 6 on social media and in cable coverage while they overlooked the officer’s track record of defending the violent 2020 riots in Kenosha.

Outlets such as The New York Times also focused on directly lying to the public about Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died of natural causes, not via a fire extinguisher to the head as they reported, instead of asking tough questions about why police failed to keep rioters out of the building.

Democrats want to pin the sins of hundreds of violent fools on millions of American conservatives, and they will go to any lengths to do it. Legislators such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., claimed to fear for their lives on Jan. 6, but they aren’t actually doing much to ensure that the political violence that occurred within the Capitol last year will be stopped by the police tasked with protecting it if it happens again.

Why Couldn’t Lawyers Blast Vaccine Mandates At The Supreme Court?,"All the petitioners needed was for the Supreme Court to enter a stay to prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration vaccination rule from taking effect, but, truly, was it too much to ask for a defense of limited government, separation of powers, and federalism?

Apparently so, because on Friday, over more than two hours of argument in National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor, lawyers pushing the Supreme Court to delay the regulation circled and sidled rather than state clearly that the rule, OSHA, the Biden administration, and the entire federal government represented a mockery of our constitutional order.

Insane that it took over an hour for one person in the court to note that a single unelected federal agency doesn’t have the authority to stick needles in the arms of every person on earth. https://t.co/dkU7Piparf — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) January 7, 2022

On November 5, 2021, OSHA issued the rule under review, framing it as an “Emergency Temporary Standard” or ETS. The ETS required all employers of 100 or more employees to “develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy,” which required employees to either be fully vaccinated or submit to weekly COVID-19 testing and to wear face coverings at work.

Congress authorized OSHA to issue “an emergency temporary standard to take immediate effect,” and without the traditional notice-and-comment process, if it “determines (A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.”

Massive Overreach Immediately Challenged in Court

The ETS was immediately challenged by individual Americans, religious groups, covered employers, states, and trade organizations, with the cases filed directly in federal courts of appeals throughout the country, bypassing the federal trial courts pursuant to the statute that authorized emergency rules.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals acted first, issuing a stay on November 6, 2021, preventing enforcement of the rule pending briefing. Less than a week later, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit—consisting of Ronald Reagan appointee Judge Edith Jones and two Donald Trump appointees, Judges Kyle Duncan and Kurt Engelhardt—issued an opinion holding that the ETS remain stayed “pending adequate judicial review” of the lawsuit challenging the OSHA rule.

The 21-page opinion, authored by Judge Engelhardt, analyzed the request for a stay and concluded that, for numerous reasons, the petitioners had a strong likelihood to succeed on the merits of their challenge and that without a stay the businesses and other petitioners would suffer irreparable injury.

Shortly after the Fifth Circuit issued its decision, pursuant to the procedures controlling when multiple lawsuits are filed challenging an ETS, all of the cases throughout the various federal circuits were consolidated and assigned by lottery to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Then, on December 17, 2021, the Sixth Circuit vacated the stay entered by the Fifth Circuit.

Sixth Circuit Deadlocks

Judge Jane Stranch, a Barack Obama appointee, authored the decision for the three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit, which Judge Julia Gibbons, a G.W. Bush appointee, joined. Trump-appointee Judge Joan Larsen dissented from the decision, concisely capturing her concern with this opening line: “As the Supreme Court has very recently reminded us, ‘our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.’”

Two days before the Sixth Circuit removed the stay, thereby setting the ETS to go into effect this month, the federal appellate court denied a request by the challengers of the OSHA rule for the court to hear the case initially en banc, or as a full court. To obtain en banc review, a majority of the active judges on the Sixth Circuit needed to vote for the full court to decide the case together, but the 16-member court deadlocked 8-8, leaving the three-judge panel in charge.

In voting to hear the request for a stay of the ETS en banc in the Sixth Circuit, Judge John Bush, a Trump appointee, opened with the closer: “Whether it uses a clear statement or not, Congress likely has no authority under the Commerce Clause to impose, much less to delegate the imposition of, a de facto national vaccine mandate upon the American public. Such claimed authority runs contrary to the text and structure of the Constitution and historical practice. The regulation of health and safety through compulsory vaccination is a traditional prerogative of the states—not the domain of Congress and certainly not fodder for the diktat of a federal administrative agency.”

Sidelining the Constitution

With all of the ammunition provided by the dissenting judges in the Sixth Circuit, as well as the Fifth Circuit’s original opinion entering the stay, one would think that when the Supreme Court fast-tracked the case for oral argument, the attorneys seeking the stay would stress the grave attack the ETS represents to our constitutional republic. But they didn’t.

Instead, Scott Keller, counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, argued “OSHA’s economy-wide one-size-fits-all mandate covering 84 million Americans is not a necessary, indispensable use of OSHA’s extraordinary emergency power which this Court has recognized is narrowly circumscribed.”

Likewise, Benjamin Flowers, the solicitor general of Ohio, arguing on behalf of the slew of states that joined in challenging the ETS, stressed “so sweeping a rule [as the vaccine mandate] is not necessary to protect employees from a grave danger as the emergency provision requires.”

Throughout the argument, Keller and Flowers also focused on the so-called “major questions” doctrine, which stems from a series of Supreme Court cases that stressed that if an agency’s regulatory action “brings about an enormous and transformative expansion in regulatory authority,” Congress must speak clearly that “it wishes to assign to an agency decisions [such issues] of vast ‘economic and political significance.”

The petitioners weren’t wrong. The OSHA rule, which is, in essence, a vaccine mandate given the shortage of tests and the federal government’s decision to force employees to pay for the cost of testing, is not “necessary” to protect employees from a “grave danger” for many reasons.

This Is Obviously Unconstitutional

First, COVID is only a grave danger to a small segment of society, while the ETS adopts the de facto vaccine mandate for all employers of 100 or more employees. The ETS also makes no distinction between employers where working conditions create a higher risk of COVID infection from those facilities where employees have limited risk. Nor, after two years of COVID, with OSHA waiting that time period to issue the ETS and the latest mutation less severe than the former ones, does the ETS fit within the concept of an “emergency” standard.

Also, far from providing the OSHA clear authority to mandate vaccinations (or a weekly medical test) in response to a virus such as COVID, the statute authorizing OSHA to issue an ETS speaks of grave dangers “from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards.” Thus, the major question doctrine supports the petitioners’ challenge to the ETS and their request for a stay.

Yes, advocates must be pragmatists, and the petitioners’ attorneys didn’t need a home run; they just needed a rain delay. But so much more could have been said, and indeed needed to be said—and forcefully so—about limited powers, federalism, and separation of powers. Yet in their desire to win the stay, there was barely any mention of these important constitutional principles.

Major Opportunity Lost

Consider this notable exchange between Ohio’s top attorney and Justice Sotomayor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: “So, if it’s within the police power to protect the health and welfare of workers, you seem to be saying the states can do it, but you’re saying the federal government can’t even though it’s facing the same crisis in interstate commerce that states are facing within their own borders. I — I’m not sure I understand the distinction why the states would have the power but the federal government wouldn’t.”

MR. FLOWERS: “The federal government has no police power, if we’re asking about that.”

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: “Oh, it does have power with respect to protecting the health and safety of workers. We have — we have — accept the constitutionality of OSHA.”

MR. FLOWERS: “Yes. I took you to be asking if they had a police power to protect public health. They — they absolutely have the –”

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: “No, they have a police power to protect workers.”

MR. FLOWERS: “I would not call it a police power. I think the Commerce Clause power allows them to address health.”

“I would not call it a police power” is as much as the Ohio solicitor general could muster for a pushback. But Congress has no “police power” no matter what it is called, and the federal government cannot “pretextually relabel” a federal de facto vaccination mandate “commerce” to gain what is, in effect, a novel police power of the national government.

The breadth of the OSHA rule and its effects on two-thirds of private businesses also threatens the “system of government ordered by the Constitution,” that gave all legislative powers to Congress. The resulting “nondelegation doctrine constrains Congress’s ability to delegate its legislative authority to executive agencies.”

Yet when provided an opportunity to hammer these points, Flowers served up the vanilla point “that although our non-delegation doctrine is not especially robust today, there are limits on the amount of authority that Congress can give away.”

The justices—and Americans—needed to hear these points because COVID has become both the excuse and the case study for authoritarianism. And from OSHA’s most recent rule, we might divine the civil corollary to the “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime,” motto, and it seems to be, “Provide me a public interest, and I’ll find the power.”

Or, elsewise said, “Cut me a mouse hole, and I’ll squeeze in an elephant.”

Cop Who Killed Ashli Babbitt Was Never Interviewed By Investigators,"When U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd went on “NBC Nightly News” to tell his side of shooting and killing unarmed Jan. 6 rioter Ashli Babbitt, he made a point to note he’d been investigated by several agencies and exonerated for his actions that day.

“There’s an investigative process [and] I was cleared by the DOJ [Department of Justice], and FBI and [the D.C.] Metropolitan Police,” he told NBC News anchor Lester Holt in August, adding that the Capitol Police also cleared him of wrongdoing and decided not to discipline or demote him for the shooting.

Byrd then answered a series of questions by Holt about the shooting, but what he told the friendly journalist he likely never told investigators. That’s because he refused to answer their questions, according to several sources and documents reviewed by RealClearInvestigations.

In fact, investigators cleared Byrd of wrongdoing in the shooting without actually interviewing him about the shooting or threatening him with punishment if he did not cooperate with their criminal investigation.

“He didn’t provide any statement to [criminal] investigators and they didn’t push him to make a statement,” Babbitt family attorney Terry Roberts said in an RCI interview. “It’s astonishing how skimpy his investigative file is.”

Roberts, who has spoken with the D.C. MPD detective assigned to the case, said the kid-glove treatment of Byrd raises suspicions the investigation was a “whitewash.” The lawyer’s account appears to be backed up by a January 2021 internal affairs report, which notes Byrd “declined to provide a statement,” D.C. MPD documents show.

Asked about it, a D.C. MPD spokeswoman confirmed that Byrd did not cooperate with internal affairs agents or FBI agents, who jointly investigated what was one of the most high-profile officer-involved shooting cases in U.S. history.

“MPD did not formally interview Lt. Byrd,” deputy D.C. MPD communications director Kristen Metzger said. And, “He didn’t give a statement while under the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation.”

After Byrd declined to cooperate with D.C MPD Internal Affairs Division’s investigation, which was led by Det. John Hendrick, his case eventually was turned over to the USCP for a final administrative review of whether his actions conformed with department policies and training.

Still, USCP concluded in August that “the officer’s conduct was lawful and within department policy.” The agency launched its administrative investigation after the criminal investigation was closed.

In April, within four months of the shooting, Byrd was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the Justice Department, which declined to impanel a grand jury to hear evidence in a departure from other lethal police-shooting cases involving unarmed citizens.

Justice ruled there “was not enough evidence” to conclude Byrd violated Babbitt’s civil rights or willfully acted recklessly in shooting her. Byrd remains the commander in charge of security for the House of Representatives.

Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department would comment on whether they pressed Byrd after he insisted on remaining silent. The D.C. police force, which shares some jurisdiction with the Capitol Police, takes the lead in internal affairs probes like this one.

Roberts questioned how investigators could find that Byrd acted in self-defense and properly followed his training procedures, including issuing warnings before shooting Babbitt, since he refused to talk about it while the investigation was open – and his statements, unlike those made to NBC, would have been taken under penalty of perjury. “How would they know if they never interviewed him?” he said, adding that it’s not enough to say an officer did nothing wrong without showing how it reached such a finding.

By avoiding an interrogation, he said Byrd avoided saying anything that could have been used to incriminate him, including making false statements to federal agents, which would be a felony. Remarkably, he did not formally invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, according to people familiar with his case, which makes the reluctance of authorities to lean on him or sanction him for not cooperating all the more puzzling.

By law, federal agencies can use leverage short of termination, such as an unwelcome duty reassignment, to persuade employees to cooperate with investigators. Byrd was put on paid administrative leave during the investigative process.

Byrd waited to speak publicly until after his statements could no longer be used against him in a criminal probe. The heavily promoted NBC “exclusive” told only his account of what happened with no opposing viewpoints. “I believe I showed the utmost courage on Jan. 6,” Byrd said.

In defending his actions, Byrd told Holt things he evidently wouldn’t tell investigators, including his claim that he shot as “a last resort” and only after warning Babbitt to stop.

However, documents uncovered by Judicial Watch reveal that eyewitnesses — including three police officers at the scene — told investigators they did not hear Byrd give Babbitt any verbal warnings prior to firing, contradicting what Byrd told NBC.

The Babbitt family has maintained that the rushed investigation amounted to a “coverup” of misconduct by the officer. It says the federal probe was conducted under political pressure, arguing that Byrd was not put through the normal rigors of a police shooting investigation to avoid making a martyr of Babbitt, an avid Donald Trump supporter. An Air Force veteran from California, Babbitt died while wearing a Trump flag as a cape. The former president has demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate her death.

Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, a former sheriff, argued Babbitt’s shooting should have been presented to a federal grand jury. “This case was mishandled from the very beginning,” the Republican lawmaker told the U.S. attorney who led the probe for the Justice Department in a recent letter. In a separate letter to the Capitol Police chief, Nehls wrote: “Many officers in the USCP I have spoken to believe the investigations of Lt. Boyd were dropped because of his position and other political considerations.”

Use-of-Force Experts Skeptical

Some use-of-force experts are skeptical Byrd did the right thing, even after watching his largely sympathetic NBC interview.

“The limited public information that exists raises serious questions about the propriety of Byrd’s decision to shoot, especially with regard to the assessment that Babbitt was an imminent threat,” said police consultants and criminologists Geoffrey Alpert, Jeff Noble, and Seth Stoughton in a recent Lawfare article.

“We have serious reservations about the propriety of the shooting,” they wrote.

They said they doubted Byrd’s claims that he reasonably believed Babbitt “was posing a threat” and had the ability and intention to kill or seriously injure Byrd or other officers or lawmakers and therefore had to be stopped with lethal force. They noted that he admitted to Holt that he never saw Babbitt, who stood 5-foot-2 and weighed 110 pounds, brandish a weapon.

Babbitt was shot by Byrd a year ago when she and other pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol amid efforts to stop Congress from certifying the state results of the 2020 election of Joe Biden. They sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject electors from Arizona and other states, where narrow results were challenged by Trump and his lawyers over allegations of voter fraud and other election irregularities.



Roberts and the Babbitt family are preparing to sue Byrd and the Capitol Police in a wrongful-death claim seeking at least $10 million in damages. Asked why his client chose not to go on the record and cooperate with investigators, Byrd’s attorney, Mark Schamel, declined comment. In an earlier interview, Schamel maintained the shooting was justified and that there is no basis for a civil case against his client.

The federal investigation of the lethal shooting was marked by secrecy and other irregularities. Unlike other officers involved in fatal shootings of unarmed civilians, Byrd was long shielded from public scrutiny after shooting Babbitt as she tried to climb through a broken window of a barricaded door at the Capitol.

For eight months D.C. police officials withheld Byrd’s identity, first revealed by RealClearInvestigations, and they have not released a formal review of the shooting, nor the 28-year veteran’s disciplinary records. Nor did the Capitol Police hold a briefing on Babbitt’s death. Records uncovered by Judicial Watch reveal authorities ordered her body cremated two days after the shooting, without her husband’s permission.

Meanwhile, the feds have thrown the book at suspected Jan. 6 rioters — publicly identifying them on a Justice Department website — and are still engaged in a national manhunt for suspects. More than 725 defendants have been charged mostly for relatively minor offenses ranging from trespassing to disorderly conduct.



So far, the select House committee set up to investigate the Jan. 6 siege at the Capitol has not explored the most lethal violence that occurred that day. Byrd was responsible for the only shot fired during the riot — all other armed officers showed restraint, including 140 who were injured confronting rioters — and Babbitt was the only person directly killed on that day. Like the other rioters, she carried no firearm; no guns were recovered from the Capitol.

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., has pledged to “investigate fully the facts and circumstances of these events.” Asked if the police shooting is on the agenda for public hearings planned for this winter, or whether it will be addressed in a final report scheduled for release before November’s congressional elections, a committee spokesman declined comment. Trump and GOP leaders have accused the panel, which is composed of seven Democrats and two Republicans, of trying to damage pro-Trump Republicans ahead of the midterms by claiming they helped orchestrate an “insurrection” and continue to pose “a threat to democracy.”

‘Point-Blank Range’

Unlike in a criminal investigation, there is no right to remain silent in a civil case. Wrongful-death litigation claiming negligence may hinge on whether Byrd warned Babbitt before opening fire on her.

Roberts said Babbitt, a former military police officer who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, would have complied with commands to stop and peacefully surrendered had Byrd or other Capitol officers attempted to arrest her. But he said additional eyewitnesses he’s interviewed say Byrd never gave her such verbal commands.

He said Babbitt wasn’t even aware that the officer was nearby because he was positioned in a doorway of a room off to the side of the Speaker’s Lobby doors. Byrd, whose mouth was covered with a surgical mask, took aim outside her field of vision and fired as her head emerged through the window. Roberts compared her shooting to an “execution.”

“Killing her by shooting her at point-blank range was completely unnecessary,” he said. “This alone renders the shooting legally unjustified.”

Roberts pointed out that Byrd had mishandled his firearm in the past. He was the subject of a previous internal investigation for leaving his loaded service pistol in a Capitol restroom. It’s not clear if he was disciplined.

At the time, the lieutenant reportedly told officers he would not be punished due to his high rank, which he kept despite the incident. But in the NBC interview, he said he was “penalized” for the 2019 misstep, without elaborating. A USCP spokeswoman declined to respond to repeated requests for information about any discipline administered for his misconduct.

Byrd could not be reached for comment, but in the NBC interview he denied receiving special treatment. “Of course not,” he said. “No way.”

Before filing a lawsuit naming a federal agency, Roberts has to send a formal complaint for a claim for “damage, injury or death” — known as a federal form SF-95 — to USCP and wait for a response. He sent the notice in May and is still waiting for the Capitol Police to reply.

“We have received the SF-95 from Ms. Babbitt’s family attorney,” USCP General Counsel Tad DiBiase confirmed to RCI in an email. He declined to say how the department plans to respond: “I cannot comment on that.”

In the meantime, Roberts said he is interviewing witnesses and also building a case from documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act.

“I am still reviewing records obtained in FOIA action and there are more coming,” he said. “I am in no rush.”

EXCLUSIVE: GOP Reps Demand Records Over Capitol Surveillance,"Image Credit Dave Newman/ Flickr

A group of seven House Republicans sent a letter to the Capitol Police on Tuesday demanding answers over the agency’s new surveillance apparatus spying on constituents who petition their government.

On Monday, Politico revealed the intelligence unit of the Capitol Police “quietly” began to scrutinize the backgrounds, records, and social media of those who meet with members after the Jan. 6 riot at the complex, including staff.

“Analysts were also directed to probe the ownership of buildings where members of Congress held their meetings,” the paper reported, where public and private off-campus visits now come under a government microscope. The Capitol building remains closed to visitors.

Beyond foreign ownership, analysts were directed to provide more information about the buildings where members of Congress held meetings. The intelligence division leadership asked analysts to search for information about how many rooms were in these buildings, what amenities were available, and even their last remodeling. Analysts also were tasked with sifting through tax and real estate records to find out who owned the properties that lawmakers visited. For example, the unit scrutinized a meeting that Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) held with donors in a private home. Analysts eyed the homeowner’s and attendees’ social media accounts, and looked for any foreign contacts they had.

To exercise your given right to petition your government, you will now submit to a cavity search which may include your tax records, real estate holdings, and social media posts.



This is physical manifestation of the new hierarchy.https://t.co/CS09qPR6AY — Rachel Bovard (@rachelbovard) January 24, 2022

House lawmakers questioned the authority under which Capitol Police may engage in the extensive surveillance of private citizens.

“Such a dramatic shift in Capitol security processes would require congressional approval, which to our knowledge has not been given,” they wrote in their letter to the Capitol’s chief security officials. “A decision to expand background checks and intelligence-gathering to a previously unsurveilled group of individuals constitutes a dramatic and troubling expansion of the USCP’s authority.”

North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a lead signatory of the letter alongside Reps. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio., who are leading the Republican investigation into the Capitol riot, told The Federalist that Capitol Police likely launched its enhanced surveillance last fall.

“We need to know everything,” Armstrong said. “I want to know where it goes, how high it goes, and why all of this exists.”

How many resources the Capitol Police have dedicated to the surveillance effort remains an open question. It was only three weeks ago Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger testified his security force was plagued with severe staffing shortages.

“The biggest challenge I have is the staffing problem,” Manger told the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. “You can’t do training if you’re so short of staffing that you can’t pull people off of posts and send them to do training.”

Federalist Senior Tech Columnist and Senior Director of Policy at the Conservative Partnership Institute Rachel Bovard wrote in Tuesday’s BRIGHT Newsletter that Capitol security’s surveillance program “threatens the essence of our representative self-government.”

“The right to petition your government is baked into the Constitution of the United States, right there in the First Amendment,” Bovard wrote. “That does not include submitting to a virtual cavity search, and having private records stored as a result, without your knowledge or consent.”

Report: Capitol Police Are Spying On Lawmakers And People They Meet,"As part of their job in screening visitors to the U.S. Capitol (should the complex ever re-open to the public, that is), U.S. Capitol Police often rummage through backpacks and purses. Lately, they may also be rummaging through more than that: your tax records, real estate holdings, and social media posts. All without your knowledge.

Besty Woodruff Swan and Daniel Lippman broke the details this week of a new Capitol Police initiative that involves deep dives into the speech, background, and lifestyle details of who members of Congress are meeting with, including donors, Hill staff, mayors, state legislators, and other Americans exercising their First Amendment right to petition their government.

In one example Swan and Lippman cite, a donor meeting attended at a private home by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, meant the homeowner and attendees had their social media scrutinized and evaluated for foreign contacts by Capitol Police. A donor meeting with Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House Republican whip, received similar treatment. The Capitol Police were directed to “search for any information about event attendees, including donors and staff, ‘that would cast a member in a negative light.'”

In both cases, the lawmakers and the attendees were unaware these checks were taking place.

All of this is occurring under the guise of the “enhanced security measures” deemed necessary after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. However, it is unclear how such measures would have actually prevented the Jan. 6 events in the first place.

The Capitol Police have provided no detailed justification. Nor have they said what they are doing with the records, how long those records are being stored, or what other purposes they have. The agency is only subject to congressional oversight — not to public records requests.

One can imagine how easily these searches could become politicized: Personal details on Capitol Hill staff, state legislators, or donors are dispersed to partisans and suddenly leaked at an opportune political moment by some agency conveniently immune to the Freedom of Information Act and subject to limited oversight. After the aggressive leaking, spinning, and shaming that bureaucrats engaged in during the Donald Trump years, we’ve seen what’s possible.

This practice also comes dangerously close to burdening the free exercise of political speech, which includes the right to petition the government “for a redress of grievances” without fear of reprisal. As Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., a former criminal defense attorney, pointed out to Swan and Lipmann, these measures also walk right up to the line of “spying on members of Congress, their staff, their constituents and their supporters.”

“Anybody involved with implementing this without making it known to the actual members of Congress should resign or be fired immediately,” Armstrong went on. “And I’m not big on calling for resignations.”

Intentionally Keeping Voters at a Distance

Subjecting American citizens to a virtual cavity search in exchange for petitioning the government they elect in the buildings they pay for is more than just a one-off, however. It is yet another hurdle thrown up by the Democratic regime in Washington to separate the rulers from the ruled.

The Capitol, as well as the House and Senate office buildings, remain closed to visitors as they have been since early spring 2020, the longest stretch in the country’s history. It’s been longer than any closure for the Civil War, or even the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu.

Football stadiums all over the country are packed, lawmakers fly to and from the Capitol on full flights and attend in-person events and fundraisers, and the Senate still votes in person (the House is still shamelessly proxy voting). But the corridors of self-government remain closed off to the people to whom they belong.

In addition to being transparently unnecessary, this undermines the nature of our self-government. Access to and interaction with those we elect is central to our representation. One of the qualities that makes America exceptional is our citizen legislature. That those we elect do not sit higher than us, but equal to us.

Placing heavier and heavier burdens on entry to the U.S. Capitol — the seat of our democracy — as well as access to those who represent us strikes at the heart of that relationship, and a central feature of republican government. It changes the detachment of our representatives from their constituencies from merely a rhetorical formulation into a literal one.

But perhaps that is the point. Security and safety theater in and around the Capitol keeps out the engagement that is part of accountability. It ensures the hoi polloi don’t accidentally get to interact with the people they elect. It keeps the participation of the masses of unwashed voters and the accountability they might bring at a healthy distance.

A Physical Hierarchy of the Ruling and the Ruled

Limiting access to the halls of our representative government is, in this way, a physical manifestation of the hierarchy that we now see all around us: between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, the people who follow The Science and those who have the gall to question it, between the corporate class and the underclass. Using theatrical excuses about Covid or Jan. 6 is a convenient proxy to further remove the political elite from the rabble they would rather rule than represent.

But this is our reality now. Working-class employees around the country are fired for rejecting a vaccine and blocked from going to restaurants and bars (including in the nation’s capital, which is overseen by Congress), “wrong thinkers” are cut off from the financial system, and bad social credit gets you cut out of the digital public square. The IRS is now requiring Americans to submit facial recognition data to access their tax records.

The hierarchy is here. Republicans in Congress should aggressively fight the new class system wherever they find it. And they should start within their own house.

Shut down the Capitol Police surveillance and re-open the Capitol, House, and Senate. Welcome Americans back into the seat of their democracy and the buildings that belong to them. In doing so, restore at least a modicum of the equality and access that has always been the hallmark of American self-government, but is now so desperately missing from D.C. and the rest of the country.

IG Opens Investigation Into Spying Allegations Against Capitol Police,"The inspector general for the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) has opened a formal investigation into whether the law enforcement agency tasked with securing the Capitol has been inappropriately surveilling elected members of Congress, their staff, and visitors to their offices, The Federalist has learned. The opening of the investigation follows news reports and accusations from lawmakers that USCP has overstepped its bounds as it tries to recover from the January 6 riots that tarnished both the Capitol and the reputation of the law enforcement agency that was supposed to keep it safe.

USCP Chief J. Thomas Manger confirmed the opening of the inspector general investigation in his response to congressional inquiries about USCP police tactics, reported in a January 24 article published by Politico, including surveilling and compiling intelligence dossiers on members of Congress, their staff, and visitors.

“While I am confident in our methods, I am asking the USCP Office of the Inspector General to review the USCP’s programs related to these security assessments to assure both this Committee, the Congress as a whole, and the public that these processes are legal, necessary, and appropriate,” Manger wrote to seven Republican lawmakers.

According to the Politico article, USCP analysts had been directed by Julie Farnam, the acting director of USCP’s Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division, to “run ‘background checks on people whom lawmakers planned to meet, including donors and associates.”

“When staff were listed as attending these meetings, Capitol Police intelligence analysts also got asked to check the social media accounts of the staffers,” the Politico article alleged.

In his letter to lawmakers, Manger denied the allegations detailed in the Politico article and claimed USCP’s activities were both appropriate and legal.

Suspicions that USCP may not be acting appropriately did not arise in a vacuum, however. In November 2021, a USCP officer entered the congressional office of Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Tex., and took a photo of a whiteboard in Nehls’ legislative office detailing various legislative plans being considered by Nehls and his staff. In a formal police report filed several days after the incident, the officer wrote that he had been conducting a routine security patrol on Saturday, November 21, and discovered that one of the doors to Nehls’ office was open.

The report claimed that the officer entered Nehls’ office and found a whiteboard that contained “suspicious writings mentioning body armor[.]” The officer reportedly took a photo of the whiteboard, which was then passed around to analysts within USCP. The following Monday, USCP dispatched three plain-clothed intelligence officers to Nehls’ office and questioned a staffer who was there about the whiteboard and the legislative proposals it contained.

Just days before the USCP officer entered Nehls’ office and took a picture of the whiteboard Nehls and his staff used to brainstorm and catalog legislative ideas, the Washington Post ran a story about a federal government contractor in rural Texas who defrauded the United States by supplying Chinese-made body armor instead of body armor manufactured in the United States.

“From his home in rural Texas, a would-be defense contractor spun a web of fake companies and testing reports to pass off Chinese-made body armor as American equipment that met rigorous standards for use by the State Department and U.S. law enforcement partners in Latin America,” the Washington Post wrote on November 16, 2021. “Tanner Jackson, 32, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Alexandria federal court to one count of wire fraud, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.”

According to Nehls, who previously served as sheriff of Fort Bend County, Texas, his office whiteboard specifically called out faulty Chinese body armor. In fact, that Washington Post article was a key catalyst spurring Nehls to consider drafting legislation banning the procurement of Chinese body armor, a spokesman for Nehls told The Federalist.

What the police report did not include was any reference to multiple items on Nehls’ whiteboard immediately following the words “body armor” referencing Export Administration Regulations dealing specifically with Chinese imports or U.S. Department of Justice standards for certifying body armor.

In correspondence on the matter with the House Administration Committee, USCP Chief Manger said the responding officer who investigated Nehls’ office was also concerned by “an outline of the Rayburn Building with an X marked at the C Street entrance” drawn on the whiteboard. A Nehls spokesman told The Federalist it was little more than a crude map to help an intern find an ice machine in the Rayburn House Office Building.

“If Capitol Police leadership had spent as much time preparing for January 6 as they spent investigating my white board, the January 6 riot never would have happened,” Nehls, a former law enforcement officer, told The Federalist. “When I was a patrol officer responding to a call, I didn’t have the time or authority to go rifling through someone’s personal papers. There are serious 4th Amendment, constitutional issues at play here.”

Although Manger claimed in one e-mail that USCP agents were concerned the whiteboard may have contained a “veiled threat” to Nehls’ life, USCP never personally contacted Nehls to warn him that he may have been in danger, Nehls told The Federalist.

The Capitol Police’s treatment of Nehls and his office only fueled the fire of suspicion between lawmakers and USCP leadership that had been smoldering following the January 6 riot. One Republican congressional aide told The Federalist that rather than addressing the massive security and intelligence failures by USCP that allowed the post-election protests to spiral into riots, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi instead doubled down on failure and used the uproar as a pretext for turning the Capitol Police into her own force of political mercenaries.

“Instead of fixing the obvious problems with Capitol security, Pelosi used January 6 as an excuse to create her own personal Praetorian Guard,” the aide said.

Comments and recommendations for mandatory background checks on staff by Pelosi’s hand-picked Capitol security adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, have also done little to quell suspicions that Pelosi is using the January 6 proceedings to justify increased surveillance of her political enemies in Congress.

“We made recommendations that everyone coming into the Capitol get background checks, the entire congressional staff,” Honore told CNN last April. “All of them need to get background checks is what we recommended.”

Those recommendations found their way into the formal report compiled by the January 6 response task force that Honore ran, leading several lawmakers to question the USCP denial that it is surveilling and profiling members, staff, and visitors.

“There are way too many unanswered questions,” Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., the top Republican on the congressional committee with oversight over the Capitol Police, told The Federalist. “The Capitol Police have a lot of explaining to do.”

“My main concern is that the entire Capitol Police board structure is dependent on political leadership to make security decisions,” Davis said. “Security decisions are being made based on politics, not on real data.”

“I’m not convinced we’re in any better security position today than we were on January 6,” he added, blaming Pelosi’s control of the process for the lack of real progress or improvements.

Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., echoed Davis’s concerns about the Capitol’s security posture.

“The Capitol is no more prepared today than it was on January 6,” Banks, who is heading up an ad hoc committee of Republicans to make security improvement recommendations, told The Federalist. “There is a lot of work to do to restore trust in the leadership of the Capitol Police.”

He cited a vote in February 2021 in which more than 90 percent of rank-and-file USCP officers said they had no confidence in their department’s leadership.

Banks also blasted Pelosi and said she is using the House’s January 6 commission as a weapon against her political opponents.

“It’s painfully clear to all of us that the sham January 6 commission is not at all interested in making the Capitol safer or preventing something like January 6 from ever happening again,” Banks said. “It’s clear that the January 6 commission is just a witch hunt against the political enemies of Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney.”

In a statement provided to The Federalist, USCP categorically denied that it had surveilled lawmakers or their staff and claimed the January 24 Politico article was inaccurate.

“We do not conduct surveillance on Members, their staff, or their offices,” a spokesman for the Capitol Police told The Federalist. “The USCP does not conduct any ‘insider threats’ related surveillance of intelligence gathering on Members, staff, or visitors to the Capitol Complex.”

The spokesman said that Manger, the USCP chief, had specifically asked the inspector general to conduct a full review of the agency’s operations in light of the allegations of improper profiling and surveillance.

“The inspector general is independent, so we cannot comment on his behalf,” a USCP spokesman told The Federalist. “But the chief has requested such a review as he is confident the USCP security assessments are legal, appropriate, and strictly limited to gathering basic information about events to ensure the safety of members of Congress.”

Was Amir Locke Helping A Murder Suspect? Media Won't Like That Critical Question,"It certainly looked like Minneapolis law enforcement screwed up cosmically in their pre-dawn home raid that resulted last week in the shooting death of 22-year-old Amir Locke, a black man. Unfortunately for the BLM people, the national media have already shot their wad on a bunch of nonexistent race and police controversies.

Locke’s case might turn out to be just as dubious as the rest and if it does, it will have been so predictable.

Available evidence indicates that cops used a no-knock warrant to force their way into an apartment where within 10 seconds they found Locke asleep on a couch in the living room and shot him three times. Police body camera footage appears to show Locke under a blanket and coming to as multiple cops are heard yelling, “Police search warrant!” “Get on the ground!” and, “Get on the f-cking ground!” According to police, Locke is then seen drawing a gun and that’s when he was fired upon.

He did not appear to be wanted by law enforcement and reportedly had no criminal history.

The media’s natural instinct is to spin this into another tale about an innocent black man shot in cold blood (which, contrary to what they say, essentially never happens).

Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post wrote Monday with great melodrama, “How many times have we rolled this damn rock up the hill? And how many times has it rolled right back down, snuffing out the life of yet another innocent Black victim?”

There’s no problem with an individual keeping a gun (or many guns!) nearby for safety. This is, after all, Biden’s America. But I keep wondering why Locke was, according to his family’s lawyer, staying at his cousin’s home, yet still felt the need to cling to a firearm as he slept.

The answer isn’t publicly available as of now, but CBS affiliate WCCO in Minneapolis reported Tuesday that police had arrested 17-year-old Mekhi Camden Speed in relation to the homicide that was tied to the search warrant leading to Locke’s death. Speed, according to the report, is Locke’s cousin.

A man named Otis Elder was fatally shot in nearby St. Paul, Minn., on Jan. 10. WCCO reported that police had been “intending to arrest the teen suspect and two associates for murder and aiding an offender after the fact” and that Locke was in one of three apartments that police had obtained a warrant to search. Speed was not in that same apartment.

The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that the apartment where Locke was found was not Speed’s at all, but that he did have “access” to it. Again, the details aren’t yet clear but Amelia Huffman, the interim Minneapolis police chief, said in a press conference last week that investigators searched that apartment and recovered “items that they believe are of evidentiary value in their homicide investigation.” The Star-Tribune also reported that when Elder was shot, according to police, he was on the phone with someone who told the authorities that “it sounded like Elder was conducting a drug transaction [and] the phone call then abruptly ended.”

To recap: Locke’s family asserts that he was spending the night at a cousin’s home. A man who is reportedly Locke’s cousin has been taken into police custody and is suspected to be involved in the killing of Otis Elder. Police obtained items “of evidentiary value” to the homicide case from the apartment where Locke was staying.

Someone might guess that Elder’s death was drug-deal related and that the person who killed him might have been worried that there would be retaliation. Maybe that person wanted friends or relatives nearby for protection. We don’t know yet.

None of it is to say Locke deserved to die. But it is to say that the corrupt corporate media are once again ready to push a narrative about cops gunning down innocent black men without giving the facts a second to see daylight.

There’s a good guess as to how this will turn out. And if that guess is wrong, blame the media for making it so hard to believe what they say about the police and race.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/08/was-amir-locke-helping-a-murder-suspect-leftists-in-media-wont-like-that-critical-question/,2022-02-08
No-Knock Raids Like The One That Killed Amir Locke Are Un-American,"The killing of Amir Locke in a no-knock police raid last week in downtown Minneapolis was a tragedy, but it was also an abject abuse of police power. New details are still coming to light, but no new information will change the plain fact that a SWAT team should never have barged in on the 22-year-old Locke, who was asleep, and then shot him dead when he understandably reached for his legally owned handgun.

I’ll put it bluntly: every American has a right to defend himself from an intruder, even if the intruder turns out to be police conducting a no-knock raid. The Locke case demonstrates what an abject violation of the Fourth Amendment no-knock raids are, and why they should be outlawed in every state.

Here’s what we know about the Locke case so far. News broke Tuesday that St. Paul Police arrested a homicide suspect in the investigation that last week led to the fatal shooting of Locke. The suspect is 17-year-old Mekhi Camden Speed of Minneapolis, who according to charging documents is Locke’s cousin. Speed has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder for the killing of 38-year-old Otis Elder last month in what appears to have been a drug deal.

Police were looking for Speed after his fingerprints were lifted from a stolen vehicle, recovered in late January, connected to the murder of Elder. The search for Speed led police to conduct early morning, no-knock raids on three apartments in downtown Minneapolis. Locke was in one of those apartments, asleep on the couch when a SWAT team burst through the door, guns drawn, shouting “Police! Search warrant!”

Graphic body cam footage shows an officer kick the back of a couch where Locke is asleep under a blanket. As he rolls off the couch, a gun becomes visible and police immediately fire at least three shots, killing Locke. The whole thing is over in about five seconds.

Locke legally owned the gun and had a permit to carry it, according to his family. We don’t yet know why he was sleeping in this apartment, but we do know that police were not looking for him. Investigators have said they were looking for Speed and two other suspects, not Locke.

But we do know, or should know, this: Locke’s father, Andre Locke, was absolutely right when he said his son “never even got the chance to get the cover off his head. He was startled. He did what any reasonable law-abiding citizen would do. White or black.”

The case has understandably drawn comparisons to Breonna Taylor, whom police fatally shot in a midnight raid in March 2020. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, woke up to the sound of repeated pounding on the front door. He, too, did what many people would have done: he grabbed his gun.

Walker and Taylor called out, asking who was there, but received no answer. Walker later said he thought they were being attacked, possibly by Taylor’s ex-boyfriend. When plainclothes police officers broke the door off its hinges, Walker fired at them, not knowing they were police. Officers responded with a hail of at least 20 bullets, striking Taylor multiple times and killing her.

Just as in the Locke case, police were not looking for Taylor when they raided her home.

These and many other high-profile cases in recent years have called into question the use of no-knock police raids. Following the release of the body-cam footage in the Locke shooting, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a moratorium on no-knock raids pending an investigation (with an exception for “imminent threat of harm” of police officers).

That’s a good start, but no-knock raids should be scrapped altogether — and there’s a compelling constitutional case for doing just that. In the 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case Wilson v. Arkansas, the court recognized that something called the “Castle Doctrine” and the “knock and announce” rule are embedded in the Fourth Amendment. The idea is that our protections from unreasonable search and seizure mean that police must knock, announce themselves, and give residents time to answer before they enter forcibly.

But here’s the hitch. The Wilson ruling allowed that in cases with “exigent circumstances,” police can enter without knocking if it means a suspect might be able to escape or destroy evidence. That exception prompted many police departments to simply declare in all search warrant affidavits that a no-knock raid was justified, citing the danger of a suspect fleeing, destroying evidence, or assaulting the officers serving the warrant.

That in turn lead to another Supreme Court ruling in 1997, Richards v. Wisconsin, which found that blanket exceptions to the “knock and announce” rule were unconstitutional. The ruling, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, found that, “If a per se exception were allowed for each category of criminal investigation that included a considerable — albeit hypothetical — risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement would be meaningless.”

Stevens went on to explain that in order to justify a no-knock raid, police must do more than just declare that because they are conducting a felony drug investigation, a no-knock raid is warranted. Instead, “the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence.”

That is, they have to justify no-knock raids on a case-by-case basis, showing why the unique circumstances of a particular entry and a particular suspect justify such a tactic.

Now, maybe the police did that in the warrant for Speed. As of this writing, the warrant remains sealed, so we don’t know. But they probably did; no-knock warrants are not uncommon in Minneapolis, in fact there have been more than a dozen no-knock raids in the city so far this year.

An investigation by the Star Tribune found that in recent years, Minneapolis police have executed an average of 139 no-knock raids annually. It’s much the same in large cities across the country. Whatever Stevens and his fellow justices had in mind to limit the use of no-knock raids, it seems clear that in practice the “knock and announce” element of the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement is in fact meaningless.

Cases like Amir Locke and Breonna Taylor should prompt action by state legislatures to ban no-knock raids across the board. The Supreme Court might have allowed for exceptions to the “knock and announce” rule, but that need not constrain state lawmakers, who should recognize what by now has become all too obvious: no-knock raids are an abuse of police power, they result too often in the killing of innocent people, and they are deeply un-American.

"Let's Talk About Mekhi Speed, Amir Locke's 'Violent' Cousin Directly Related To Locke's Death","The Washington Post has so far run three pieces in its opinion pages this month on the “wrongful” death of “innocent” Amir Locke, a 22-year-old black man. But not a single one of them references the name Mekhi Speed, Locke’s 17-year-old cousin.

That’s strange. Given that Speed is directly related to Locke’s fatal run-in with police, you’d think the people at the Post might find him worth mentioning, at least in passing.

A Hennepin County, Minn., judge last week unsealed search warrants related to the pre-dawn home raid that resulted in the shooting death of Locke. As authorities had stated, Locke isn’t named in the warrants that authorized the “no-knock” entry of three separate units in one apartment building.

Locked happened to be in one of those units, which building security said was accessible to Speed after he had asked for a key fob. Speed’s brother, Marlon, lived in that unit with his girlfriend and Mekhi had recently been inside, though he lived in one of the other apartments with his mother.

The police raid was conducted for the purpose of collecting evidence and potentially apprehending Speed, who was wanted for allegedly robbing, shooting, and killing 38-year-old Otis Elder in nearby St. Paul, Minn. A witness on the phone with Elder said he believed that Elder was in the process of a drug deal when he was shot.

Speed, who was already on probation for a separate shooting incident, was only one suspect wanted in relation to the killing of Elder. Another suspect wanted by authorities lived in the same apartment complex. According to police, both parties “have been actively involved in numerous crimes throughout the metro since at least November 2021, to include robberies, ﬁrearm incidents, and ﬂeeing the police in a motor vehicle. A criminal history review of the known suspects in this homicide revealed that they have a history of violent crimes.”

In short order, everyone on scene the day of that deadly police raid seems to have been closely associated with a violent thief suspected of murder, as well as his accomplices. That doesn’t make them guilty, but it certainly raises questions about the circumstances that some writers at The Washington Post aren’t interested in exploring.

Police body camera footage from the raid shows cops using a key to unlock the entrance door of the unit where Locke was sleeping on a couch in the living area. Within 10 seconds, police descended on Locke, who emerges from underneath a blanket with a gun, before fatally shooting him three times.

Contrary to the padlock-shut media narrative that Amir Locke was a completely innocent casualty of a racially tinged police raid gone wrong, we actually have no idea yet if he was implicated in the homicide or any other one of Speed’s wrongdoings. It’s true that Locke wasn’t named in the search warrants, but that only relates to the Minneapolis police department’s search of the apartment complex.

The investigation is actually being conducted by Saint Paul. A spokesman for the city’s police confirmed with me Tuesday that that probe is ongoing and that all of its findings haven’t yet been made public, including in what capacity, if any, Locke was involved.

Will it turn out that Locke had nothing to do with Speed and was ultimately the innocent victim of a cosmic screw-up by law enforcement? Maybe! Is it possible, instead, that Locke knew exactly what he was getting into when he chose to stay at the home of his cousin, whose brother was wanted for murder? We don’t know.

The problem is that some people at The Washington Post, married to a fake narrative about police hunting down black people, are pretending they already do.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/15/lets-talk-about-mekhi-speed-amir-lockes-violent-cousin-who-is-directly-related-to-lockes-death/,2022-02-15
Canadian Veteran: Trudeau Has Declared War On His Own People,"Harold Ristau was born in Kitchener, Ontario, and deployed several times to Iraq and Afghanistan in the Canadian armed forces as a military chaplain. He told a local paper he was motivated to join the military after helping Afghan refugees with asylum cases while he pastored an inner-city church in Montreal. In 2014, Canada awarded Ristau one of its highest military recognitions, the Chief of the Defense Staff Commendation, for “achievements beyond the line of duty.”

He wore that medal atop his veteran uniform when he visited the trucker Freedom Convoy in Ottawa on Feb. 12, he told The Federalist in a phone interview. There, smartphone cameras captured him leading other veterans in slowly dismantling a blockade around a war memorial, then cleaning and decorating the monument. Police stood by and watched.

Then Ristau led attendees in the Lord’s Prayer, Apostle’s Creed, and a rendition of “O, Canada,” the national anthem. He also gave a benediction and led the crowd in an impromptu prayer for peace and the well-being of those in government, as well as accountability for their abuses of the Canadian people over the past two years. The convoy began when the Canadian government started enforcing vaccine passports on truckers and others at its border with the United States.

“We prayed to hold those who have done bad, who need to repent and take account for wrongdoing, that they be held accountable for their sins and receive the mercy of God,” Ristau told The Federalist. “We prayed that there be no injuries, that no one here would have a hateful thought in our hearts, that our hearts would be filled with love.”

Ristau noted that before police closed in on the protesters, the demonstration had a sort of market fair attitude, with bouncy castles for children, soup kitchens for the hungry, and organized cleanups of public property. When there were complaints about the truckers’ noise and local disruptions, they stopped making noise after 6 p.m., local news accounts confirm. He also witnessed that the truckers kept emergency lanes open during their protest to protect locals.

For his peaceful participation in this public assembly, Ristau has faced criticism and threats from fellow pastors, fellow citizens, the government-run Canadian media, and the government itself. On Feb. 14, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, which he claims allows the Canadian government to seize the children and property of anyone who attended the protest, without a court order or even proceeding.

“Since this legislation was enacted in 1988, we have faced separatist movements that sought to break up the country, terrorist movements that sought to wreak havoc and a pandemic that has brought our society to a standstill. Not once has the federal government resorted to this law or these extraordinary and overreaching measures,” noted Toronto Sun columnist Brian Lilley on Sunday.

The Canadian government has also deployed anti-terrorist banking measures to shut down the personal and crowdfunding accounts of those involved in the protests.

Canadian police arrested nearly 200 protesters Sunday and threatened those who brought their children to the Ottawa protest with up to five years in prison. In response, convoy organizers announced an orderly departure from the nation’s capital. On Monday, the Canadian Senate is scheduled to review Trudeau’s use of the act previously known as the War Measures Act, which was only used once before to unilaterally suspend the rule of law in the country, during a hostage and murder situation in Parliament in the 1970s.

Using the act in response to a peaceful protest with largely only traffic violation-level offenses, Ristau said in an interview with the Christian radio program Issues, Etc. last week, means “you basically declare war on your own people.” As a Canadian veteran — he is now a civilian chaplain supervising Canadian military chaplains — threatening to use war powers against one’s own citizens is a clear breach of law and public trust, he said.

It’s also dangerous to a democracy, in which governments are supposed to wield their powers under the rule of law and with the consent of the governed. Yet “from the get-go Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has treated [the Canadian truckers] like terrorists,” Ristau said on the program. “You don’t negotiate with terrorists.”

Violence related to the protest has been largely used by those opposed to the convoy and its counterparts in other parts of Canada. Perhaps the most significant act of violence was when a man allegedly drove an SUV headlong into convoy supporters, injuring four.

While the Royal Mounted Canadian Police cleared Ottawa streets over the weekend, they trampled several protesters with their horses, including an elderly woman with a walker, according to the Toronto Sun. Police also beat journalists while clearing the streets over the weekend, according to videos. The government is investigating several incidents of alleged police violence and allegedly leaked police messages including “Time for the protesters to hear our jackboots on the ground.”

“Over in Ottawa on Friday they were singing ‘A Mighty Fortress is Our God,” Ristau told The Federalist. “We have masses of people praying in front of the police as they come in and use pepper spray and rubber bullets on them.”

Earlier, the Canadian government and crowdfunding site GoFundMe attempted to confiscate millions of dollars in donations to the convoy. The identities of donors to the fund were publicly released, after which some donors have been fired from their jobs. Private citizens who contributed have had bricks thrown through their shop windows, they told the Sun.

Briane is a single mom from Chilliwack working a minimum wage job. She gave $50 to the convoy when it was 100% legal. She hasn’t participated in any other way. Her bank account has now been frozen. This is who Justin Trudeau is actually targeting with his Emergencies Act orders. — Mark Strahl, MP (@markstrahl) February 20, 2022

“When you make protesting illegality illegal, what does that mean for democracy? That’s why protesters won’t go home and are staying to be arrested. When it’s illegal to protest illegality, what measures do we have left?” Ristau asked.

“Once you’ve named someone a terrorist, I guess you can just do what you want,” Ristau said.

Due to the videos of him praying at the protest, Ristau told The Federalist, he received a death threat confirmed by local police, besides other forms of severe social rebuke. The father of five children ages 19 and younger says being treated as a domestic terrorist for peacefully petitioning his government to stop violating both Canadian laws and his Christian beliefs says he’s been more frightened by Trudeau suspending civil liberties over a peaceful protest than almost anything else in his 50 years of life.

“I’m not a chicken. I’ve been on the frontline overseas—Iraq, Afghanistan several times. I’ve been shot at, I’ve been blown off my feet. I’ve been at mass graves, I’ve been at mass casualties. I can’t count the number of bodies I’ve moved,” he told The Federalist. “I still have combat boots that I use for gardening. They’re a reminder to me of the good men, Americans and Canadians, who died for freedom. And it’s always a reminder of the importance of freedom. It’s not just about my rights but it’s also about being able to spread the gospel and to be human, to be the person God has made me to be.”

Ristau said in the last two years in Canada, the government has used people’s fear of Covid to suspend basic human rights, as well as sneak through radical changes to social policy. Those have included proposals to legally make abortion a human right — making pro-lifers de facto opponents of “human rights” — and let children medically mutilate their bodies without parental consent. Many Canadian hospitals and doctors now deny medical care to people who aren’t vaccinated.

“There hasn’t been a climate of ‘we can agree to disagree.’ Hence, people are being fired and losing their incomes and their livelihoods because they’re not vaccinated,” he said. The Freedom Convoy participants, most of whom were vaccinated, said this was too far.

Ristau also noted that government discrimination has not only been based on people’s medical decisions, but also has encompassed clear discrimination against religion. Canadian Covid regulations have banned people from singing in church, attending church for large stretches of time or unless they accept government-demanded medical procedures, handling the body and blood of Christ as their churches require, and from attending church without registering their names with the government. All of these are clear violations of the Bible or classic Christian teachings.

So Ristau considers objecting to Covid impositions not only his civic duty, but also “as standing for the sake of Christ. As a Christian, I am interested in ensuring that our freedom of speech is ensured, that the preaching of the gospel is not muzzled.”

Canada’s Parliament is considering a bill, C10, that would censor public statements of basic Christian teachings, such as about sex and marriage. It would also censor public criticism of the government, such as possibly social media postings about the Freedom Convoy and any dissent from Covid regulations.

Ristau noted both that a good number of Canadians — half in some polls — support the Freedom Convoy, but that he and his family have been repeatedly ostracized for their objections to the last two years of increasing tyranny under an unending state of emergency. But he can’t be silent, he said, even at the risk of losing his job or being prosecuted for attending a peaceful protest: “My parents escaped from Germany under the Nazis and Communists. I’ve seen real terrorism. Our freedoms are at stake here.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/21/decorated-canadian-veteran-and-pastor-trudeau-has-declared-war-on-his-own-people/,2022-02-21
Biden’s State Of The Union Promise To ‘Fund Police’ Was Pure Lip Service,"In Tuesday’s State of the Union address, President Joe Biden claimed he wants to restore safety and control crime. He denounced efforts to “defund” the police. But with congressional elections coming up, he lacked any useful proposals.

During the State of the Union, Biden claimed that “the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.” However, last year, even liberal fact-checkers acknowledged: the bill “did not stipulate that the relief funding had to be used on police officers or for other law enforcement initiatives.”

Biden’s own Treasury Department summarized the spending this way:

The Rescue Plan will provide needed relief to state, local, and Tribal governments to enable them to continue to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. In addition to helping these governments address the revenue losses they have experienced as a result of the crisis, it will help them cover the costs incurred due responding to the public health emergency and provide support for a recovery – including through assistance to households, small businesses and nonprofits, aid to impacted industries, and support for essential workers.

Where does this mention police or prosecutions as priorities?

Biden’s claims look a real change from what he said during the presidential campaign. Back in July 2020, when asked if Biden supported “redirect[ing] some of the funding for police into social services,” he responded: “Yes, I proposed that kind of reform.”

But you don’t need to go back to the campaign to see how superficial Biden’s words were on Tuesday. See what he said when he went to New York City last month and gave a major address on crime. What did he propose?

Did Biden point out that the Democrats in New York City cut the police budget by $1 billion per year? No.

Did he note how New York’s bail reform has let violent criminals out on the street only to commit more crime? No.

Did he criticize district attorneys in New York City or elsewhere who are not prosecuting violent criminals? No.

Did he express concern over the large numbers of inmates released from jails and prisons? No.

Of course, those calls would have upset many Democrats. But, unfortunately, besides lip service that he wants to reduce crime, he didn’t offer any of these obvious concrete proposals during his State of the Union address. On Tuesday, Biden offered no specific proposals to ensure funds go to the police.

Targeting Guns Instead of Criminals

Instead, the only specific proposals focused only on gun control. Biden ignores that over 92 percent of violent crime has nothing to do with guns.

He talked about the need to “repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued,” which is a lie. People can sue gunmakers if they sell a gun illegally or make a defective gun. Biden wants to make gun manufacturers civilly liable for misuse of firearms they sell. That means people could sue manufacturers and sellers whenever a crime, accident, or suicide occurs with a gun. The end goal is to put gun makers out of business. Imagine if you could sue Ford the next time someone gets intentionally run over with an F150.

He talked about an assault weapon ban, but in his New York City address, Biden talked about banning any semi-automatic gun that “can hold” a large capacity magazine. He has repeated that theme many times over the last few years. The problem is that any semi-automatic gun manufactured today “can hold” or has the “ability” to hold a magazine of virtually any capacity. About 85 percent of all handguns made were semi-automatics that “can hold” magazines. Almost as many rifles also fit that definition.

At the same time that Democrats are eviscerating law enforcement and prosecutions, Biden wants to make it difficult for people to defend themselves. Semi-automatic guns provide critical self-defense benefits. If we force law-abiding victims to rely on single-shot guns, they could find themselves in trouble. If they face multiple criminals or fire and miss their target, individuals may not have the time to manually reload their gun.

Biden talked about passing background checks on the private transfer of guns, but not using these background checks to create a national gun registry. He put together nearly one billion firearm purchase records. The government now has a searchable digital database containing 866 million transactions, including some 54 million made in 2021 alone. Federal law explicitly prohibits the creation of a federal firearm registry, but Biden is making one anyway.

This national gun registry isn’t complete because not all states have background checks on the private transfer of guns, and Biden hasn’t yet gotten all the transaction records that licensed gun dealers have. Federal agents can now type in a person’s name into a computer and possibly come up with all the guns they purchased.

It isn’t rocket science to understand why crime is increasing, and it isn’t the fault of gun owners. Many parts of the country are in dire need of basic law enforcement. But despite nice rhetoric, Biden is refusing to face the crime problem seriously.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/bidens-state-of-the-union-promise-to-fund-police-was-pure-lip-service/,2022-03-02
"Facing The Results Of Their Ideas, Leftists Are Backpedaling Like Mad","Image Credit Daniel Lobo/Flickr

It would appear that leftists don’t actually like a lot of the radical policies they have been advocating for since the beginning of the lockdowns and the death of George Floyd in spring 2020. From homelessness to crime to Covid policies, the left is backtracking on much of its platform in the face of disastrous results and frustration from rank-and-file liberals. Recent developments in our nation’s capital provide some of the most dramatic examples.

Cities across the country are taking a more aggressive stance on homeless encampments in response to residents’ complaints, including Washington, D.C. An early February poll conducted by The Washington Post found that three-fourths of Washingtonians support the district’s plan to clear the camps of homeless persons that now proliferate across the city.

That the American Civil Liberties Union and even some D.C. council members oppose Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s cleanups have not stopped their enforcement. Bowser has quite a mandate for this: the number of city residents who want these camps cleared does not substantially change based on respondents’ race, and is above 70 percent for white, black, Hispanic, and Asian residents.

That the district is pursuing this policy with substantial local support is a bit ironic, given that so many prominent leftist organizations, local leftist leaders, and Democratic politicians have been trying for more than a year to protect these encampments. This included Ann Marie Staudenmaier, wife of Maryland gubernatorial candidate Tom Perez, who last year advocated for homeless camps in the district to be permitted and protected. “Don’t evict them from the only place that they have to call home,” she urged.

Perhaps it has something to do with how large numbers of homeless persons affect the cleanliness, security, and attraction of neighborhoods. A separate recent WaPo article cited residents who noted homeless persons in the camp have harassed them. One D.C. resident said downtown is “not pleasant” and that the ubiquity of the encampments threatens the security of local residents.

Although many on the left would likely grimace to say it, national trends on curbing these camps indicate a significant percentage of the rest of America feels the same way.

Refunding the Police

Mayors of America’s largest cities, once responsive to calls to defund the police, have done a dramatic reversal in response to local frustration with higher crime rates. Now “refund the police” has become the cry of many liberal residents.

In D.C., residents’ opinions on crime and police have experienced this shift, given increased crime and murder rates in the city since 2020. According to a recent WaPo poll, a sizable majority (59 percent) now agree that increasing the number of police officers patrolling communities would reduce the amount of violent crime in D.C.

“The share of Washingtonians who say they are not safe from crime has risen to 30 percent this year from 22 percent in November 2019 and is the highest in more than two decades of Post polls,” reports the WaPo.

This is quite a change from the “defund the police” initiatives city residents — and various activist groups — so loudly endorsed after the death of George Floyd. The D.C. government in 2020 supported measures in June 2022 to cut $15 million from the police department budget. At the time, the police chief warned this could lead to the loss of hundreds of officers and that underfunding training and equipment might result in officers using more excessive force.

Thankfully, D.C. is not alone in wanting to refund the police. As NBC reported in February, Democratic politicians are calling the “defund the police” movement “dead” and mayors in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago are “moving to increase police budgets and end ‘the reign of criminals.’”

Surrendering to Pandemic Fatigue

Democratic states are also ending many Covid restrictions in the face of rising complaints from their constituents. Consider D.C. Mayor Bowser’s mid-February announcement that she would lift the city’s vaccine requirement for businesses and “dial back” the city’s indoor mask rules. This announcement followed a number of states — including many governed by Democrats — that have also eased their restrictions as polls come back showing their rising unpopularity. Now D.C.’s party scene is “returning to normal,” reports the WaPo, even though coronavirus case counts in and around Washington remain “high.”

This is a remarkable and speedy shift, especially considering D.C. had some of the most strict Covid restrictions in the country. Perhaps the District’s dramatic about-face has something to do with widespread annoyance with pandemic restrictions, even among liberal voters. Perhaps it results from the rising tide of Democratic politicians listening to their constituencies despite “public health guidance” claiming the country is moving too fast in loosening the rules.

Perhaps all of these changes also relate to the fact that the District of Columbia is no longer experiencing the population boom and gentrification that have defined the last couple of decades. The capital’s population declined by 2.9 percent from 2020 to 2021, according to the Census Bureau. Living in an increasingly dangerous, filthy nanny-city is apparently not that appealing, even to the District’s majority leftist population. This has been part of a broader national trend as people across the nation in 2021 left Democratic-run states.

Mugged by Reality

To borrow a phrase from the late Irving Kristol, D.C. residents (and liberals across the country) have been mugged by reality — and in some cases actually mugged. Perhaps living in a lefty utopia where the homeless camp wherever they like, undisturbed by a defunded police force, with fickle and irrational health-related restrictions isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.

Democrat D.C. residents, like the rest of Americans, don’t actually like their public spaces overrun by homeless persons, their neighborhoods suffering increased violent crime rates, or their cities stuck in a cycle of never-ending draconian public safety regulations.

What this all means is that, thankfully, certain activist narratives that threatened all Americans have lost considerable steam. It also means these policies are likely political liabilities in upcoming elections. Perhaps it also shows there are certain things that all Americans can still agree on.

Report: Capitol Police Were Severely Unprepared To Handle Events Of J6,"Image Credit Alex Smith/Flickr

U.S. Capitol Police lacked guidance and training to handle the rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, a new report says.

The report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that most of the 315 officers interviewed felt severely unprepared to handle any unauthorized breach of Capitol property. The report reaffirms what multiple other watchdog organizations labeled as a massive security failure by the Capitol Police and House of Representatives leaders, who failed to give the officers clear direction and autonomy to make security decisions.

At least 211 of the officers testified to GAO that they had little to no guidance from leaders in the force before the events despite intelligence indicating there would be a major demonstration and possibly rowdy crowd. Even during the height of the Capitol riot, at least 209 officers admitted that instructions were “slightly clear, not at all clear, or not provided.”

At least 80 respondents also claimed they were hesitant to use force against violators due to “fear of disciplinary actions” from the department and a lack of understanding about what kind of force would be appropriate to use against rioters. As a result, more than half of the officers questioned by the GAO, 180, said they desired more training that is “realistic” and gives practical steps to control a crowd.

After the 2020 summer of destructive riots, when polls showed a lack of confidence in law enforcement, it’s no surprise that understaffed police departments would urge their officers to cut back on potentially controversial actions to avoid becoming a target for racial justice rioters. At the time of the Capitol riot, the department’s force policy stated that “officers are only authorized to use the level of force that appears reasonably necessary to bring a subject under control while protecting the lives of officers and others.”

One officer even testified in the GAO report that the Capitol Police department “is always worried about optics and never really want[s] us to go hands on with the public.”

“Several respondents stated that the concern with optics was related to leadership’s perception of the desires of Members of Congress,” the report clarified.

The last time we heard about bad “optics” related to Capitol law enforcement was when former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned from his leadership post shortly after Jan. 6, told The Washington Post that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who is ultimately responsible for the security of the Capitol, denied his request for the National Guard to assist his officers. Sund specifically noted that Pelosi’s House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving claimed that deploying the Guard would be bad “optics,” especially for House leaders who previously shunned using the military against civilian rioters.

As a result, at least 151 respondents claimed there was a “lack of leadership and communication” surrounding the events on Jan. 6. Approximately 55 officers agreed that the leadership in the Capitol Police department needs to be “changed or improved.”

Capitol Police officials and even D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser have admitted that Jan. 6 exposed key failures of the law enforcement department, but so far, the department has largely failed to implement the recommendations made by the Capitol Police Inspector General and others.

"Distracted With Spying, Capitol Police Orders Useless Capitol Evacuation","The U.S. Capitol Police ordered an immediate evacuation of the Capitol grounds early Wednesday evening over an aircraft that posed a “probable threat” to the complex. Within a half hour, the threat turned out to be bureaucratic incompetence.

“The Capitol was evacuated out of an abundance of caution this evening,” the department wrote on Twitter.

The aircraft provoking the brief evacuation turned out to be an Army parachute team for Wednesday’s baseball game at Nationals Park for Military Appreciation Day. Washington Examiner National Security Reporter Tom Rogan found the aircraft on radar moments after the Capitol alert. Add a quick online search, and it became clear the plane was connected to the local sporting event honoring service members.

Meanwhile, the Capitol Police have been too busy spying on congressional lawmakers, their staff, and constituents who petition their government.

In January, Politico revealed Capitol surveillance began to stretch far beyond opening backpacks and purses upon entry to the visitors’ center. The department’s intelligence unit “quietly” launched an initiative to scrutinize the backgrounds, records, and social media of those who meet with members of Congress after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, including staff.

“Analysts were also directed to probe the ownership of buildings where members of Congress held their meetings,” the paper reported. Public and private off-campus visits now come under a government microscope of the agency tasked with security for the Capitol building.

Beyond foreign ownership, analysts were directed to provide more information about the buildings where members of Congress held meetings. The intelligence division leadership asked analysts to search for information about how many rooms were in these buildings, what amenities were available, and even their last remodeling. Analysts also were tasked with sifting through tax and real estate records to find out who owned the properties that lawmakers visited. For example, the unit scrutinized a meeting that Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) held with donors in a private home. Analysts eyed the homeowner’s and attendees’ social media accounts, and looked for any foreign contacts they had.

That’s no small operation for an agency that failed to prepare for the Jan. 6 protests House Democrats have exploited to execute a state-sponsored persecution of their political opponents.

In February, Federalist reporting revealed the surveillance provoked an investigation from the agency’s inspector general. Capitol Police reportedly broke into Texas Republican Rep. Troy Nehls’ office and took a picture of a whiteboard detailing “suspicious writings mentioning body armor,” according to a formal police report.

Officers later returned to interrogate staff over what turned out to be legislative planning notes. Days before the officers entered Nehls’ office, the Washington Post published a story on a federal contractor in Texas who defrauded the government with Chinese-made body armor instead of armor domestically produced.

Nehls, a former Texas sheriff, told The Federalist the whiteboard highlighted issues with the foreign-manufactured armor.

“If Capitol Police leadership had spent as much time preparing for January 6 as they spent investigating my whiteboard, the January 6 riot never would have happened,” Nehls said. It’s also conceivable the Capitol Police would have escaped the embarrassing evacuation call issued Wednesday.

“When I was a patrol officer responding to a call, I didn’t have the time or authority to go rifling through someone’s personal papers. There are serious 4th Amendment, constitutional issues at play here,” Nehls added.

Republican lawmakers have demanded answers about the Capitol Police’s new surveillance apparatus working at the behest of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

On Tuesday, Politico published comments from attorney Dan Gebhardt, who “represents five people who worked in the department’s intelligence division in January of 2021” with whistleblower concerns about the agency’s practices undermining the First Amendment.

Among the allegations from Gebhardt’s clients: Capitol Police intelligence analysts were directed to scrutinize a religious leader who officiated a funeral that a member of Congress attended. Analysts were also directed to ‘conduct research’ on the relatives of members of Congress as part of their security work, according to his statement. And they didn’t like it.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/21/while-distracted-spying-on-congress-capitol-police-orders-useless-capitol-evacuation/,2022-04-21
Black Prosecutor Brings No Charges Against Cop Who Killed Amir Locke,"The name Amir Locke probably sounds only vaguely familiar at the moment, but rest assured that it is now one more piece of the Black Lives Matter movement’s great white supremacy myth. With, of course, a helpful assist from the ready-to-lie national media.

Recall Locke as the 22-year-old black man shot dead earlier this year by police during a no-knock warrant raid in Minneapolis. The incident naturally sparked city-wide riots and outrage from leftist journalists eager to pour more kerosine on our race bonfires.

The illiterate Ben Crump was quick to say at the time that Locke’s death was another example of black Americans unable to “sleep safely in their beds at night” because of a racist police force.

Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post wrote with feverish melodrama, “How many times have we rolled this damn rock up the hill? And how many times has it rolled right back down, snuffing out the life of yet another innocent Black victim?”

Locke had been asleep on the couch of an apartment he was visiting that early morning when police came in through the front door yelling, “Police search warrant!” “Get on the ground!” and, “Get on the f-cking ground!” Body camera footage showed that Locke had been underneath a blanket and began to emerge with his hand in possession of a gun. One officer, identified as Mark Hanneman, fired three shots that ultimately killed Locke.

Locke wasn’t the subject of the search warrant and wasn’t wanted for any crime. Police were searching for his cousin, Mehki Speed, who was suspected of killing a man just a few days prior. Speed lived with his mother in the same apartment building but also had key access to the apartment where Locke was staying. (Speed this week pleaded guilty to the murder.)

Authorities opened an investigation of the incident to determine whether Hanneman was justified in firing on Locke. That probe wrapped up a month ago. Despite the initial extensive media coverage of Locke, I would bet our next multi-billion-dollar “aid” package to Ukraine that not a single person reading this has a clue as to what the conclusion of the investigation was.

That’s because, other than a couple obligatory mentions from the New York Times and the Washington Post, the national media showed virtually no interest in the decision by the Minneapolis attorney general not to bring any charges against Hanneman or the police force.

That’s right. The officer who shot Locke dead is no legal jeopardy. He is under no threat of time in prison.

Really? Yet “another innocent black victim” killed by police but nothing from the media? Why might that be? I know! Maybe because the prosecutor who made that decision, Keith Ellison, is black!

Ellison released his decision on April 6, stating that his office would be unable to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt a criminal charge against any … officer involved in the decision-making that led to the death of Amir Locke.”

With specific regard to Hanneman, Ellison said, “Under current law – and as awful as the circumstances of this tragedy are – there is not sufficient admissible evidence to support a criminal charge.”

The law in Minnesota provides that a police officer is justified in using deadly force against a target should he reasonably perceive in the moment, without the benefit of hindsight, that “such force was necessary to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm.”

A statement by Hanneman about the shooting during the raid said he did believe Locke posed a threat, given the circumstances related to the high-risk search order, and that Locke was non-compliant with police orders to drop his weapon and place himself on the floor.

“The individual was crouched and beginning to rise from behind the ottoman,” Hanneman said. “As that individual did so, I noticed that the individual had a handgun in their hand and was brandishing it, and pointed it at me. In this moment, I feared for my life and the lives of my teammates. I was convinced that the individual was going to fire their handgun and that I would suffer great bodily harm or death.”

It’s certainly a tragedy. For that very reason, the use of no-knock warrants is facing legal restrictions in Minnesota and elsewhere. But you know what it’s not? Racism.

It’s not a blind leap of faith to know that’s exactly what it would have been called had Ellison been anything other than black. Thank God we were spared.

None of this is about to matter, though. Locke’s name is already one more piece of BLM’s great white supremacy myth.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/12/black-prosecutor-brings-no-charges-against-cop-who-killed-amir-locke-doesnt-get-called-white-supremacist/,2022-05-12
"In Uvalde, Extreme Cowardice And Incompetence Among Local Police","As more details emerge about the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, it’s becoming hard not to conclude the worst about the local police response: Uvalde cops apparently stood aside and did nothing while the shooter killed 19 school children and two teachers inside a classroom.

A shocking news conference on Friday revealed that more than an hour passed after the shooting began and before an elite team of Border Patrol agents, whom Uvalde police had prevented from storming the classroom earlier, decided to ignore those orders and confront the gunman, ending the massacre.

During this time, about 78 minutes, as many as 19 police officers were reportedly in the hallway outside the classroom, while multiple students inside the classroom called 911 begging for the police to be sent in. But none came.

At the news conference, Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said the on-scene commander mistakenly believed that the shooter had barricaded himself in the classroom and that “there were no kids at risk,” which is just a euphemism for believing that all the kids in the classroom had already been killed. Pressed on this by reporters in a series of tense exchanges, McCraw at one point said, “From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision. Period.”

Who made that decision? McCraw said that the on-scene commander was the chief of police of the Uvalde school district, a man named Pete Arredondo. Chief Arredondo was not at the press conference, and no one has heard from him since Tuesday.

How Chief Arredondo could have possibly concluded that there were no children at risk and that this was not an “active shooter situation,” while 911 calls were coming from kids inside the classroom with the shooter, is perhaps the central question that needs to be answered. On Friday, McCraw detailed some of those harrowing 911 calls. Keep in mind that during these calls the local police stood outside and did nothing.

A caller identified — I will not say her name, but she was in room 112 — called 911 at 12:03. The duration of the call, was 1 minute and 23 seconds. She identified herself and whispered she’s in room 112. At 12:10, she called back, in room 112, advised there are multiple dead. At 12:13, again, she called on the phone. Again at 12:16, she’s called back and said there was eight to nine students alive. At 12:19, a 911 call was made, and another person in room 111 called. I will not say her name. She hung up when another student told her to hang up. At 12:21, you could hear over the 911 call that three shots were fired. At 12:36, a 911 call, it lasted for 21 seconds. The initial caller called back. The student-child called back, and was told to stay on the line and be very quiet. She told 911 that he shot the door. At approximately 12:43 and 12:47, she asked 911 to please send the police now. At 12:46, she said she not could not—— that she could hear the police next door. At 12:50, shots are fired, they can be heard over the 911 call. At 12:51, it’s very loud, and sounds like officers are moving children out of the room. At that time, the first child that called was outside before the call cuts off.

The following exchange, between a reporter and McCraw at the press conference Friday, is absolutely damning. If it doesn’t result in the forced disbandment of the Uvalde Police Department, it should at least result in the firing of Chief Arredondo and every officer who was in that hallway but made no effort to save those kids:

""What efforts were the officers making to try and break through either that door or another door to get inside the classroom?""

All this comes as news reports in recent days, along with video footage posted to social media, have detailed how desperate parents gathered outside the school during the shooting and demanded that police officers there go in and engage the shooter.

One woman, Angeli Rose Gomez, a mother whose two children were inside the school, was apparently handcuffed by police for insisting they take action. When she eventually talked her way out of the handcuffs she sprinted into the school, found her kids, and rescued them herself. That was after she drove 40 miles from her workplace after she heard about the shooting.

“The police were doing nothing,” Gomez told The Wall Street Journal. “They were just standing outside the fence. They weren’t going in there or running anywhere.”

More details are sure to emerge in the coming days, but so far it appears that local police acted with extreme cowardice and incompetence, and as a direct result of the decisions made by Chief Arredondo, an unknown number of schoolchildren were killed who might otherwise have been saved.

At the very least, McCraw and the other top law enforcement officials need to have clear answers about what happened, and why, the next time they get in front of the cameras. If they don’t, they’d better be drafting their letters of resignation right now.

8 Lies Texas Officials Told About Uvalde That Should Get Them Fired,"More than one week after an 18-year-old gunman stormed Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, state officials are still struggling to set the record straight on what really happened that led to the deaths of 19 kids and two adults.

For a week now, the public, the press, and politicians have been on a wild goose chase to find out why it took more than an hour for good guys with guns to take down a school shooter in a small school in the small South Texas town last Tuesday.

Unfortunately, Texas safety officials have traded the truth for multiple false, misleading, and vague statements that have significantly undermined the public’s trust in law enforcement’s ability to protect children like the fourth-graders who lost their lives in the attack.

Not only have they severely undercut the trust of Americans, they’ve infuriated the mourning Uvalde community.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he felt “misled” and “livid” after hearing that a poor police response significantly contributed to the delay in action against the shooter. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also lamented that “No one mentioned the fact that there was this 45-minute to an hour hold by the chief of the police of the school district while there were still shots being fired.”

Here are eight lies Texas officials told about the Uvalde shooting that should get them immediately fired.

1. A School Resource Officer ‘Engaged’ the Suspect

Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Director Steve McCraw originally said a school resource officer “engaged” the suspect before he entered the school.

At one point, McCraw switched tracks and said the officer “was not on campus” at the time of the shooting.

Elsewhere, officials were reported saying the school officer simply “confronted” the shooter instead of actively engaging him.

Texas DPS was forced to walk back both accounts a couple of days later when word got out that the school resource officer completely failed to notice the shooter when he drove past the suspect who was “hunkered down” behind a vehicle.

“[The shooter] walked in unobstructed initially,” Texas DPS Regional Director Victor Escalon eventually admitted. “So from the grandmother’s house, to the [ditch], to the school, into the school, he was not confronted by anybody.”

2. The Shooter Was Outside the School for 12 Minutes Before Entering

Escalon said last week that the shooter lingered outside of Robb for 12 minutes after crashing his car into a nearby ditch. Days later, McCraw said the gun-wielding teen was inside the school within five minutes of wrecking.

3. The Door the Shooter Entered Through Was Left Propped Open by a Teacher

Original reports from the shooting scene at Robb Elementary suggested that a teacher left a back door at the school propped open with a rock which is how the shooter entered the building.

McCraw volunteered the information during his Friday press conference and claimed that DPS obtained video evidence to support this theory.

“We know from video evidence, at 11:27 the exterior door suspected for what the — where we knew the shooter entered, Ramos — was propped open by a teacher,” he said.

Recent statements from Texas state police, however, suggest that the teacher accused of neglecting the back door went back to close it after seeing Ramos. The door, however, did not automatically lock properly. The unnamed teacher’s lawyer also denies that his client left the back door open.

In a complete contradiction of DPS’s original claim, some outlets are even reporting that “security footage obtained from the area has backed up the claim that the teacher closed the door at this time.”

4. The Gunman Was Wearing Body Armor

DPS spokesman Sgt. Erick Estrada claimed shortly after the shooting that the suspect carried “a rifle and [had] body armor on.”

Another DPS spokesman, Lt. Christopher Olivarez, later claimed that the gunman was wearing a vest designed to carry extra ammo but did not have any plates on him.

5. Officers Quickly Engaged The Shooter

McCraw originally said that the first law enforcement officers who arrived at the school “did engage” the shooter “immediately.”

“The bottom line is law enforcement was there,” McCraw said the day after the shooting. “They did engage immediately. They did contain [the gunman] in the classroom.”

Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez also claimed that his officers “responded within minutes.”

It wasn’t until three days after the tragedy that McCraw admitted local law enforcement shied away from helping students and staff after taking fire from the suspect. McCraw claimed that officers misclassified the suspect as a barricaded shooter and that “there were no kids at risk.” Officers reportedly stood outside of the school and then outside of the classroom for nearly an hour while waiting for a Border Patrol tactical team to show up at the scene where students were repeatedly calling 911 for help.

By the time BORTAC arrived and used a janitor key to enter the afflicted fourth-grade classroom, the shooter had been on school property for more than an hour.

6. Officers Weren’t Well Enough Equipped

Oliverez claimed that local law enforcement officers retreated because “they could’ve been shot” and wanted to wait for specialized backup. Records, however, show that Chief Pete Arredondo of Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, who ordered officers to stay outside of the classroom where the gunman was, was trained to respond in active shooter situations.

Records show Arredondo recently completed eight hours of active shooter training in December of 2021. He also went through eight hours of the same training in 2020 and 16 hours of “Terrorism Response Tactics – Active Shooter” in 2019. Furthermore, the Uvalde Police Department bragged on Facebook in 2018 about a grant that equipped every officer with body armor.

7. CISD Chief Is Or Is Not Responding to Investigators

DPS claimed on Tuesday that Arredondo has not responded to investigators over his role in delaying a law enforcement response to the Robb shooting.

”The Uvalde Police Department and Uvalde [school district] Police have been cooperating with investigators,” DPS said in a statement. “The chief of the Uvalde [school district] Police provided an initial interview but has not responded to a request for a follow-up interview with the Texas Rangers that was made two days ago.”

On the same day, multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News that “The Uvalde Police Department and the Uvalde Independent School District police force are no longer cooperating with the Texas Department of Public Safety’s investigation.”

Arredondo, however, told CNN on Wednesday that “I’ve been on the phone with them every day.”

8. Local Law Enforcement Didn’t Mislead Anyone

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin denied that local law enforcement misled the public about their actions during the school shooting.

“Local law enforcement has not made any public comments about the specifics of the investigation into the incident or [misled] anyone,” McLaughlin said. “Statements by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick that he was ‘not told the truth’ are not true. All statements and comments made to date about the ongoing investigation are being handled by DPS/Texas Rangers.”

Local law enforcement may not have directly said much about the Uvalde shooting, but officers failed to clarify any of the blatant misinformation parroted by DPS, allowing the public to be misled for days.

San Francisco Pride Bans Police Uniforms But Naked Marching Is OK,"Police in San Francisco will no longer attend the city’s pride parade at the end of June after organizers barred officers from wearing their official uniforms through the streets they’ve sworn to protect.

“We want them to march in the parade,” said Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride, in an interview with a local ABC affiliate last week — so long as they obey a dress code. Meanwhile, plenty of attendees will maintain their tradition of marching naked. “They can march in marching t-shirts that say SF police, or SF County Sheriff’s Department, that’s fine, but no full uniform.”

The San Francisco Police Department responded by refusing to participate.

“Even though our members may not be marching in this year’s Pride Parade, the San Francisco Police Department will be on hand to ensure that everyone attending and participating in SF Pride Weekend activities enjoys a safe and celebratory Pride Weekend in San Francisco,” the department announced in a press release.

San Francisco Police Officers Pride Alliance condemned the organizers’ decision in stronger terms through a three-page press release.

“Let us be clear: this committee would not order the leather community to wear polyester at the parade. This committee would not order the drag community to wear flannel,” the officers’ pride coalition said. “But they have told us, peace officers, that if we wear our uniforms, we may not attend. For LGBTQ+ officers, this brings us back to a time when we had to hide at work

that we were LGBTQ+.”

The San Francisco Fire Department announced the city’s firefighters would join the police in solidarity.

“We need to allow the public to see that our uniformed law enforcement officers are good, they do reflect our community,” Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Baxter told ABC7.

Mayor London Breed said she will also sit out of the parade unless organizers offer to capitulate on servicemembers’ uniforms.

“I love the Pride Parade, and what it means for our LGBTQ community and for our city. It’s one of my favorite events of the year,” Breed told ABC7. “However, if the Pride Board does not reverse its decision, I will join our city public safety departments that are not participating in the Pride Parade.”

Organizers of Seattle pride events have similarly asked police not to attend the community festivities.

“Leaders of PrideFest have asked police to stay off of the festival grounds for this year’s June 26 event,” Axios reported last week of the festivities that take place at the end of the city’s grand parade. “PrideFest is making the same request for a smaller event it will host June 25 on Capitol Hill.”

PrideFest organizers also barred police from a rally held in its historically gay neighborhood, saying the animosity is warranted because of law enforcement’s use of force during the 2020 riots.

“We will continue to request police stay respectfully at the perimeters,” Seattle’s Capitol Hill group told Axios.

Should Texas Let School Districts Run Their Own Police Departments?,"On May 24, as a murderous gunman wrought terror and death through two adjoining classrooms full of children at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, 19 municipal police officers stood in the hallway outside, waiting. Forty-seven more minutes elapsed before the officers, led by officers from the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC), breached the door and neutralized the situation.

That’s 47 minutes. Waiting.

The incident was managed by Pedro Arredondo, the chief of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department. In Texas, school districts may allow a law enforcement presence on their campuses either by contract with an overlapping law enforcement entity—such as a municipal police department or county sheriff’s office—or by creating and staffing their own police department.

Arredondo has run the UCISDPD since early 2020, with a staff of five subordinate officers. According to several commentators, Arredondo’s decision to transition from an “active shooter” protocol to a “barricaded suspect” protocol may have contributed to the incident’s lethality.

It may very well be time for Texas to reevaluate this redundant model.

While it is important to note that facts are still emerging on the events of that fateful Tuesday and that one tragedy alone is insufficient to reorder an institution like policing, advocates from the political left and right have been calling for dialing back or eliminating school district police departments. While their rationales slightly differ, both point to potential negative consequences of an overpoliced learning environment.

This duplicative system poses practical questions, as well. In Texas, schools are funded in large part through ad valorem taxes on property, making up the single largest levy most property-owning Texans pay.

Similarly, both counties and cities levy a tax against that same property, as well as any number of special-purpose districts. In the case of law enforcement, a property owner may be paying for three overlapping layers of the same service: the school district police department, the municipal police department, and the sheriff’s office, each of which provides policing services.

However, not all policing training regimens are created equal. School resource officers are mandated to have additional active shooter training, but may not have access to the necessary tactical training available to larger departments. Furthermore, it is exceedingly rare for district police departments to have enough personnel coverage to allow a member to participate in regional tactical units.

If we believe it is important to have police officers in schools to ensure a safe learning environment, it is in the best interest of local taxpayers—those with children who are in these schools—to ensure every dime is being spent responsibly and not, as seen in Uvalde, potentially impeding a crisis response.

In June, two trade organizations that represent key police officials—the Texas Association of School Resource Officers and Texas School District Police Chiefs Association—will be holding their separate conferences at hotels off of the Riverwalk in San Antonio, less than a 90-minute drive from the scene of the massacre. It will be interesting to see if the events prompt a self-examination of both the form and function of these departments.

The onus is on the school districts to prove that this model actually keeps children safe, and is not just another avenue to a government pension.

5 Questions For The J6 Committee's Theatrical Production,"The House Committee on Jan. 6 will launch its dramatic summer hearings tonight in a prime time show trial produced by a former ABC News executive as desperate Democrats aim to shift the narrative ahead of the midterms.

The nine members of the Select Committee appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will introduce the panel’s findings and question a pair of witnesses while presenting graphic footage of the riot to a nationwide audience. Every cable network, except Fox News, will broadcast the proceedings in an arrangement sought by the partisan probe to elevate the evening’s drama shining light on a three-hour riot that happened more than 18 months ago.

Absent from the panel asking questions, however, will be any Republicans appointed by GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy after Pelosi took the self-proclaimed “unprecedented” step of barring Reps. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, from the probe. Instead, Pelosi hand-picked the most vocal pair of NeverTrump House members to serve in their place, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who serves as vice chair and was disowned by her own party.

House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik told reporters on a press call Tuesday the prohibition on minority-appointed members for the first time in congressional history renders the Select Committee illegitimate, as it was established in violation of House rules.

“This Committee is not about seeking the truth,” Stefanik said. Meanwhile, the committee established to probe the Capitol riot declares Pelosi’s own culpability off-limits in pursuit of prosecution against political dissidents. Former Donald Trump Trade Advisor Peter Navarro was the first to be indicted by the Justice Department last week based on committee conduct.

But before the Select Committee continues with a national soap opera for the cameras, here are five questions that must be answered.

1. Why Did Nancy Pelosi Delay Deploying the National Guard?

Not only was the National Guard not present to reinforce Capitol barriers with Capitol Police, it took three hours for the Guard that was standing idly by to receive the final green light for deployment as the complex was being ransacked.

Four days after the riot, former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned his post in the aftermath, told The Washington Post his request for pre-emptive reinforcement from the National Guard ahead of Jan. 6 was rejected by Pelosi. Sund said House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, overseen by Pelosi, thought the guard’s deployment was bad “optics” two days before the raid. Pelosi and House Democrats had previously condemned the presence of federal troops in the nation’s capital to quell the violent mobs overrunning the city in the name of social justice.

The Daily Caller later cited three sources familiar with Irvin’s conversations with the House Administration Committee after the riot. The sergeant of arms said discussions with the speaker’s staff were factors in his “blender of decision making.” The Caller’s sources remained anonymous, “citing the fear of putting a chill on further witnesses to how the security situation unfolded Jan. 6.”

Questions remain, then, about what conversations Pelosi had about the deployment of the National Guard before and during the riot, and why Sund’s requests were rejected not once, but six times, as the former police chief told the Washington Post.

In what was portrayed as a blockbuster revelation from the committee in December, texts from former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows made clear the National Guard would, at minimum, be on standby.

2. Why Did the Sergeant at Arms Refuse to Cooperate With the Senate?

In the Senate’s 128-page bipartisan report published in June last year, lawmakers in the upper chamber outlined “notable exceptions” among those who cooperated with committees. Among them was Irving’s office, which “did not comply with the Committees’ information requests.”

As Pelosi’s chief security advisor in the House who engaged in discussions about the National Guard with the speaker, what did Irving hide from senators that representatives now have no interest in uncovering? Pelosi’s deputies in the lower chamber have already been ordered by the speaker to conceal any information from members of the minority.

3. Why Were The Capitol Police Half-Staffed?

Capitol Police were made aware of the potential for mass unrest unfolding at their doorstep on Jan. 6. They had been warned by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI, according to a report from the Capitol Police inspector general.

Beyond internal intelligence assessments, however, the risk of turmoil capping off an election cycle with repeated outbreaks of widespread violence was enough to lead the parking attendants to restrict access.

“Due to the possibility of large-scale public protests, access to the Capitol plaza will be restricted,” read an email from the House Parking Team on the eve of the riot. “For the safety and security of personnel on the House campus, we ask that staff strongly consider parking in the Cannon and Longworth House Underground Garages.”

According to a DOJ memo revealed in a separate lawsuit with Judicial Watch, “normal staffing for a joint session was less than half” of what is “usually assigned” to the lower chamber on Jan. 6. Was Pelosi made aware of the staffing shortage?

4. Why Were the Few Capitol Police Who Were On Duty So Unprepared?

In their report last summer, complete within six months as opposed to Pelosi’s Committee taking 18 to coincide with the upcoming midterms, the Senate revealed Capitol Police weren’t just understaffed the day of the riot. They were ill-trained and ill-equipped.

“[U.S. Capitol Police’] Civil Disturbance Unit operates on an ‘ad hoc’ basis, without sufficient

training or equipment,” lawmakers found. They continued, emphasis added:

Of USCP’s 1,840 sworn officers, only approximately 160 are trained in advanced civil disturbance tactics and use of ‘hard’ protective equipment. Fewer than ten are trained to use USCP’s full suite of less-than-lethal munitions. On January 6, some of the ‘hard’ protective equipment was defective or not staged in close proximity to the officers.

Rank-and-file officers were also not given periodic training in civil disturbance, even after the year of unrest that plagued the nation’s capital. Short on equipment and training to quell a mass demonstration, the Capitol Police were overpowered at their barriers as the National Guard took three hours for approval of assistance.

5. Were FBI Informants Present On Jan. 6? If So, How Many, and What Did They Do?

In January, Newsweek revealed the Justice Department deployed “national” forces from the FBI installation at Quantico operating with “shoot-to-kill authority” as a precautionary measure ahead of the riot. At a committee hearing days later, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz demanded an agency executive answer about the FBI’s potential provocative involvement.

“How many FBI agents or confidential informants actively participated in the events of Jan. 6?” Cruz asked the Executive Assistant Director for the FBI’s National Security Branch Jill Sanborn.

Sanborn repeatedly refused to answer, even as evidence mounts of the FBI’s presence at the Capitol, including a confirming report in The New York Times.

Don’t Expect Answers From the J6 Committee

Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., made clear the panel had no interest in probing Pelosi’s culpability, even as the speaker’s failures remain at the center of the security breach.

“If you look at the charge that we have in the resolution, it says the facts and circumstances around January 6,” Thompson said. “I don’t see the speaker being part and parcel to that.”

Republicans disagree.

“There is culpability here because the speaker is responsible for the security of the Capitol,” Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry said on Tuesday’s call with reporters.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/09/5-questions-that-must-answered-before-the-j6-committee-begins-its-theatrical-production/,2022-06-09
"A Would-Be School Invader Failed Thanks To Locked Doors, Brave Police","While Democrats continue exploiting the Uvalde shooting victims to prattle on about “assault weapons” and so-called “common-sense gun control,” another school was attacked on Thursday, but it won’t make the headlines.

That’s because this school — Walnut Park Elementary School in Gadsden, Alabama — didn’t have any victims except the would-be invader, who was shot dead by police after he tried and failed to bust into the building. Here’s how it all reportedly went down.

A passerby saw a man “aggressively” trying to get into the school building. When the man was unsuccessful, he tried several other doors, all of which were locked. The responsible observer called to report the man, the school principal put the building on lockdown and called in a police officer who doubles as the school resource officer, and that officer called for backup. If the reports are correct, the chain of command worked smoothly thanks to decisive action and quickly followed protocols.

The resource officer reportedly engaged the would-be invader, who then also allegedly attempted to forcefully enter a marked police vehicle and to take the officer’s gun. More police officers rushed to the scene to help, and the assailant was shot and killed. According to the city’s school superintendent, the schoolchildren who were there “seemed to be unaware the incident occurred.”

In other words, a man who “aggressively” tried to break into a school and take the firearm of a police officer was stopped because doors were properly locked and police officers acted bravely and urgently.

Hmm. That’s interesting. Because according to President Joe Biden, failed presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, rom-com celebrity Matthew McConaughey, and late-night political scold Jimmy Kimmel, the only way to end the “carnage” of schoolchildren being murdered is to pass anti-gun laws or issue executive orders that radically infringe on the Second Amendment but are slapped with an innocuous “common-sense” qualifier so they don’t sound so bad.

Nothing else would do the trick, such people say — despite the fact that the Uvalde killer had no problem passing a background check, entered through an unlocked door, and faced little resistance from law enforcement for a disgustingly long time.

When Texas Sen. Ted Cruz responded to the Uvalde murder with calls for better school security in the form of locked doors and single-point entry, which could have prevented that killing, leftists and the corporate press ridiculed him for focusing on doors. “[S]enator Ted Cruz comes out bravely against doors,” scoffed The Atlantic’s Molly Jong-Fast on Twitter. “Are they really gonna make it about ‘too many doors on the school’? They are, aren’t they?” chimed in woke comedian Patton Oswalt.

Meanwhile, nobody on the left wants to talk about the criminal failures of the Uvalde police and the Department of Public Safety. That’s in part because if they had done their jobs rather than standing outside like cowards for the better part of an hour, lives undoubtedly would have been spared. It’s also because the implication of Democrats disarming responsible citizens is that the only remaining defense will be armed government employees, who may or may not have the courage to actually help anyone.

Thankfully, in Alabama on Thursday, police did have that courage, and lives were saved because of it. But Democrats and their media lapdogs won’t speak a word of Walnut Park Elementary because it obliterates their gun “do somethingism.”

It turns out we don’t need celebrity lectures and sweeping gun control to keep schoolchildren safe. We just need locked doors and adults who do their dang jobs.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/10/a-would-be-school-invader-in-alabama-failed-when-the-doors-were-locked-and-police-werent-cowards/,2022-06-10
"The Uvalde School Shooting Was A Failure Of Leadership, Not Gun Laws","There is a 100 percent chance of more school shootings. The more media posts photos of the shooters and dedicates airtime to the monsters who kill our children, the more likely copycats will appear. If politicians spent the amount of energy on legislation requiring school safety that they do on trying to use the events for gun control measures, our schools would be much safer.

The final investigative report on the Uvalde, Texas school shooting this spring will no doubt be worse than we know at this time. Yet it’s still clear from the facts we do know that blaming gun ownership for the tragedy is a mistake.

According to the Texas DPS timeline, at 11:35 a.m. that day, officers “receive[d] grazing wounds from the gunman.” They then showed rank cowardice and retreated, but it’s unclear whether they fired back. At some point the so-called Uvalde school police chief arrived, but he had no police radio with him during the incident.

The Uvalde Police Failed to Learn From Tragedy

The failures of the police response certainly contributed to the tragedy. What’s worse is that the officers clearly had failed to learn or act on training from previous such shootings.

The Columbine High School massacre and attempted bombing occurred on April 20, 1999. Twelve students and one teacher were murdered. As result, law enforcement drastically changed their standard response from “wait for the SWAT team” to “wait for three others,” known as “the quad.” Later the standard police response became to simply wait for one more officer.

In the last few years, it changed again to a single-officer response. That means the standard now is that the first officer on the scene must engage the shooter to stop him and then at once rescue those who may be wounded.

Failure to follow these protocols has contributed to other school mass tragedies. In February 2018, an active shooter murdered 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School in Parkland, Florida. Despite the new protocol learned from Columbine, deputies from the Broward Sheriff’s Office did not engage the active shooter, which no doubt resulted in more death, either from gunshots or students bleeding out.

The Florida governor suspended the Broward County sheriff. Later, the Florida Senate voted to confirm the removal of the sheriff, largely as a result of the failures at the MSD shooting. No one imagined that after Columbine and then after MSD Parkland a failure to at once engage an active shooter would ever happen again — but it did in Uvalde.

A Failure to Secure the School

Besides the lack of police following active-shooter protocols, let’s consider what went wrong with the school. Why were classroom doors unlocked or not able to be locked? When shots were heard in the school, why didn’t teachers and administrators at once lock down? Why didn’t school police have master keys to the classrooms?

When police were dispatched to respond to a man with a rifle at or near the school, why didn’t police immediately call the school and instruct them to lock down? Why didn’t police even engage the shooter through the classroom windows if they couldn’t get into the classroom door right away?

The answer must be an obvious lack of training and understanding of the priorities of life in these situations. The priorities known to every well-trained officer are: (1) hostages, (2) innocent civilians, (3) law enforcement, and (4) suspect, in that order.

There was also a lack of tactical thinking in Uvalde. A shooter is a “push,” meaning officers must engage in a continued search until the suspect is found and either eliminated, surrendered, or barricaded alone. One changes the speed of the search based on clues or real-time intelligence like sounds of shooting or screaming.

Another consideration is groupthink. Groupthink occurs when a group that shares a common belief system, such as police officers, gives up individual decision-making abilities and acts as “one mind.” That is, even if an individual officer clearly knows a decision is wrong, he goes along with the group consensus.

This leads to restricted, and often illogical, group behavior, such as the Uvalde officers hesitating in the hallway for three-quarters of an hour. While courage can’t be taught, training can go a long way to implant automatic action under stress.

In terms of training, police agencies should “train for when, not if.” Most rank-and-file law enforcement officers only have to qualify (meaning train) once a year, while most armed private school security personnel qualify every quarter. That must change.

The purpose of going to the shooting range for an officer is to initially learn the mechanics of proper shooting behavior. Then the officer must shoot under stressful scenarios. Hopefully, such training happens on a regular basis.

Practicing for a “school shooter” event once is almost totally useless to prepare for an action that may not occur for years. People forget strategies or become overwhelmed by the “weapon-focus effect” and can’t process information.

What to Do Instead of Blaming Guns

After this school shooting in Texas, all parents in America should be asking their school boards and administrators what they are doing to protect the children. Every sheriff, police chief, and federal agent in charge should be moving immediately to make sure all schools in their jurisdictions are as safe as possible. What if some of the trillions spent on Covid (that went to green causes) or the billions for Ukraine (with no oversight) went to protect our children in schools here at home?

Parents across the country must rise and cause changes now. Harden schools now. Most private schools are far more secure than public schools because of less politics involved, sometimes more money to spend on security, and the fact that their students are less likely to come from dysfunctional homes.

Finally, preparing for non-linear future events is often ignored. Why didn’t the local police have a “go-bag” that had the school blueprints, common interagency radio frequencies, and most importantly, a key to get in, ready? These are simple things to do to prepare to stop a crisis within a crisis from occurring.

Like Columbine and Parkland, Uvalde was a stunning failure of leadership at many levels.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/10/the-uvalde-school-shooting-was-a-failure-of-leadership-not-gun-laws/,2022-06-10
Election Denier Stacey Abrams Also Denies She Wanted To Defund Police,"Image Credit Tamyaz Valley/Flickr / Tamyaz Valley/Flickr / CC BY 2.0

Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who was among the many leftist figureheads touting “defund the police” amidst the violent 2020 riots, told Axios on Thursday that she never wanted to do exactly that.

“I do not, and have never said, and have never supported defunding the police,” Abrams said.

In June 2020, however, CNN’s Alisyn Camerota asked Abrams “so yes to some defunding?” in an interview following the killing of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta.

“We have to reallocate resources, so yes,” said Abrams.

Axios today quotes Stacey Abrams: ""I do not, and have never said, and have never supported defunding the police.""



Abrams in June 2020: ""We have to reallocate resources, so, yes."" https://t.co/jTlvv4ypeQ pic.twitter.com/CpkvACs5r9 — Eddie Scarry (@eScarry) June 23, 2022

Abrams’ recent hypocritical statement comes off as a last-ditch effort to win favor among Georgia voters as she attempts to beat incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, whose pro-police platform helped win the seat.

Over 200 Atlanta police officers quit their jobs in 2020, largely due to low morale in the wake of a summer of riots, and the city experienced 157 homicides in the same year, a 58 percent uptick.

Despite her newly pro-police funding stance, Abrams is poised to run a tough race against the incumbent governor, with Kemp leading her 51 percent to 44 percent according to Emerson College Polling.

Perhaps Abrams’ unpopularity also stems from her denying election results for Georgia’s governor in 2018 after losing to Gov. Brian Kemp. She made the unfounded claim the election was “tainted” when she lost by 1.4 percentage points.

Abrams must have figured out she needed to renounce the “defund the police” movement, which proved wildly unsuccessful for democrats in 2020. Many other Democrats have also gone back on their word and now claim to support our men and women in blue. It is difficult to believe that Abrams wants to support law enforcement after previously running a campaign with a platform so staunchly against them. The hypocrisy of her past and current beliefs makes Abrams’ promises difficult to trust. Both Axios and Abrams hope to fool Georgians, and the country, into forgetting her past anti-police sentiments in hopes that it’s enough to win her a spot in the Georgia governor’s mansion this November.

"After Cops Shot, Philly Mayor Can't Wait To Abandon City To 'Enjoy' 'Stuff'","Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney had some choice words after two local law enforcement officers were shot at a July 4 parade but none of his anger had to do with addressing the rising crime that has plagued the City of Brotherly Love for years.

As a matter of fact, the “defund the police” Democrat’s reaction to the news that two police officers were in the hospital was to express excitement that his mayoral term is ending soon because “there’s not an event, or a day, where I don’t lay on my back, and look at the ceiling, and worry about stuff.”

“I’ll be happy when I’m not here, when I’m not mayor, and I can enjoy some stuff,” Kenney continued.

BREAKING/LISTEN: “I’m waiting for something bad to happen all the time. I’ll be happy when I’m not here. When I’m not mayor and I can enjoy some stuff.” @CoconnellFox29 follow-up question “You’re looking forward to not being mayor?” @PhillyMayor “Yeah.” @FOX29philly pic.twitter.com/yC1f96Uhw9 — Steve Keeley (@KeeleyFox29) July 5, 2022

Specifically, Kenney’s “waiting for something bad to happen all the time” has to do with guns, which he claimed will forever bear the blame for problems in the nation “until Americans decide that they want to give up the guns and give up the opportunity to get guns.”

Philly Mayor Jim Kenney (D): ""Until Americans decide that they want to give up the guns, and give up the opportunity to get guns, we’re going to have this problem."" pic.twitter.com/z3FxmJQrfO — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) July 5, 2022

So while the Philadelphia Police Department struggles to grapple with injured officers and the city’s record-high homicide rate which is on track to be much worse in 2022, the mayor is whining about gun control.

Philadelphia’s crime problem has been going on for years, but Kenney has repeatedly failed to address it. As a matter of fact, during the George Floyd riot era, Kenney made things worse by declining to increase the police budget to reflect the law enforcement needs in his city.

After facing pressure to defund the police, Kenney and the city council’s preliminary budget in 2020 sought to cut police funding by $14 million at a time when rioters were ransacking and looting small businesses after George Floyd’s death.

One year later, Kenney froze the police budget to prevent any increases in spending on the department.

To put it in perspective, in 2015, the year Kenney was elected, the PPD had close to 6,600 officers and at least 800 civilian employees. In the first quarter of 2022, the department only had 5,900 sworn officers and 600 civilians despite a significant increase in violent crime across the board.

As a result of Kenney’s neglect, Philly is suffering a “historic shortage of police.” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said that those officers who are still on the department’s payroll are “bearing heavier case loads, suffering from burnout, and experiencing increased stress.”

Maybe that’s why more than 63 percent of the city’s residents think Philly is “on the wrong track” and more than 70 percent of those surveyed listed increasing crime, drugs, and other public safety problems as their top issues of concern.

Kenney appears to care about crime and cops in his city as much as he cared about Philadelphia’s Covid-19 lockdown rules, which isn’t saying much. The officers injured on July 4 are well on their way to recovery but the city may not be unless the next Philadephia mayor prioritizes supporting the police instead of defunding them.

Jayland Walker Was Not An ‘Unarmed Black Man’,"In this week’s edition of “George Floyd is Jesus and All Cops Are Pigs…”

The Akron, Ohio, police department on Sunday released camera footage showing the deadly pursuit and shooting of 25-year-old black man Jayland Walker. Naturally, more “mostly peaceful” protests followed (that ridiculous phrase was used verbatim in The Washington Post) along with media coverage framing the incident as another unarmed-black-man-gunned-down-by-police story.

NBC News: “Ohio police officers shot fleeing Black man dozens of times, lawyer says.”

New York Times: “Videos of Jayland Walker Shooting by Police Raise More Questions.”

Washington Post: “Akron police release video of officers shooting Black man dozens of times.”

PBS: “After police kill unarmed Black man Jayland Walker, Akron police release bodycam footage.”

MSNBC: “Protesters demand justice after bodycam video released shows fatal shooting of Jayland Walker.”

To their credit, the media got at least some things right. Walker was “fleeing” when he was shot. He was hit apparently “dozens” of times. But Walker’s story is less about racial injustice and more about: Attempting to evade police in a high-speed chase while firing a gun endangers the lives of countless innocent people, and getting shot for it is sometimes a thing that happens.

In the early morning hours of June 27, law enforcement attempted to stop Walker for an unspecified traffic violation. He floored it, reaching up to 85 miles per hour in a 35-miles-per-hour zone, according to police body camera footage. Surveillance video and body camera audio show Walker firing a gun out the driver’s window. After several minutes of the high-speed chase, which climaxed in a residential neighborhood, Walker exited the still-moving vehicle from the passenger door, his face covered in a black ski mask, and continued his attempt to escape by foot.

Police first tried subduing Walker with tasers but were unsuccessful. After merely seconds into the chase, according to camera footage and police testimony, Walker turned toward the cops and that’s when he was fired upon multiple times by eight officers.

Authorities said he sustained as many as 60 injuries, though it remains unclear how many were bullet wounds.

An attorney for Walker’s family told The Washington Post, “I ask you, as he’s running away, what is reasonable? To gun him down? No, that’s not reasonable.”

So here we go. Rioters took to the streets in Akron, shouting, knocking over police barriers, and lighting a dumpster on fire. All because Democrat mayors, governors, and attorneys general have insisted for two years now that crime be legalized.

As was the case with Andrew Brown in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, last year, Walker was not simply trying to escape an arrest. He was recklessly maneuvering a vehicle in ways that jeopardized his own life, the lives of the police, and the lives of any potential pedestrians, including children. Even worse than in the Brown case, Walker fired a gun in the chase. Police found the firearm and a loaded magazine in his car.

True, Walker didn’t have the gun when he began his foot race, but why should that make a difference? Describing him as “unarmed” because he, unknown to police, tossed his gun is like describing Joe Biden as a “genius” because he trashed his press conference notecard instructions after having read them.

Evading police in a high-speed chase is, in every way, a highly dangerous and potentially violent crime. A child walking home in her own neighborhood could have been killed, thanks to Walker’s choice to speed off into the darkness. Again, he reached up to 85 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone.

It’s long past time for the media and the Black Lives Matter crew to give up the knee-jerk reaction to defend every single black male who puts everyone in danger by fleeing the police — unarmed or, in this case, not.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/06/jayland-walker-was-not-an-unarmed-black-man/,2022-07-06
A Young Gun Owner In Indiana Did What Uvalde Police Wouldn’t,"Elisjsha Dicken, a 22-year-old Hoosier who happened to be spending Sunday evening at the Greenwood Park Mall with his girlfriend, used his personal 9mm Glock handgun to stop a mass shooter’s killing spree. He eliminated the gunman about two minutes after the shooting started, saving “countless” lives. In contrast, after a shooter began firing on children and teachers in Uvalde, Texas, less than two months ago, it took police 78 minutes of cowardice before an elite Border Patrol team ignored local police orders and entered the classroom where the killer was barricaded, shooting him.

The shooter in Greenwood, Indiana, took the lives of three victims before Dicken stopped him. In Uvalde, the death toll was seven times that.

Dicken had “no police training and no military background,” according to Greenwood Police Chief James Ison, who added that “his actions were nothing short of heroic. He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, [and] was very tactically sound, and as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning for people to exit behind him.” He did not hold a permit, but legally carried the handgun under Indiana’s new “constitutional carry” law, which went into effect July 1. Local news reported that he “steadied himself against a pole” before firing 10 rounds at the shooter from a distance of 40 yards, bringing the shooter to the ground.

In contrast, Chief Pete Arredondo of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District was specifically trained for active shooter scenarios, but he still ordered officers not to enter the classroom where the gunman had barricaded himself in with fourth graders.

“Records show Arredondo recently completed eight hours of active shooter training in December of 2021. He also went through eight hours of the same training in 2020 and 16 hours of ‘Terrorism Response Tactics – Active Shooter’ in 2019,” The Federalist reported at the time. “Furthermore, the Uvalde Police Department bragged on Facebook in 2018 about a grant that equipped every officer with body armor.”

A Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman tried to defend the inaction of police, explaining “they could’ve been shot” in a CNN interview. DPS Director Steve McCraw admitted that the efforts made by police outside the barricaded door to “try and break through either that door or another door to get inside the classroom” were “none.” Police even reportedly detained concerned parents who tried to rush into the school when officers would not.

In contrast, Dicken didn’t run from the shooter nor express fears that he “could’ve been shot.” He pushed his girlfriend, 19-year-old Shay Goldman, to safety and told her to stay down while he engaged the shooter, according to Goldman’s grandmother. As a private citizen who put himself in danger to save others, Dicken did more to protect the lives of strangers than the Uvalde police did to protect the citizens they are sworn to defend.

Dicken has yet to make any statements, and his lawyer has asked for his privacy to be respected. “He needs prayers because to take someone’s life is hard,” Goldman’s grandmother told local news. But with consideration for his privacy, his name is the one that deserves to be plastered across headlines as a hero — not the name of the 20-year-old killer, as media outlets so often do after mass tragedies.

Dicken’s actions remind us that, even when law enforcement does everything right (unlike what happened in Uvalde), your first line of defense should be yourself. The distance from your hand to a holster on your hip will always be shorter than the distance police have to travel to the scene. And when officers of the state show regrettable cowardice, as they did in Uvalde, the only courage you have to rely upon is your own.

"Portland Church Cleans Up Drug Encampment, Mayor Fixates On Guns","The Democratic mayor of Portland, Oregon, Ted Wheeler, has declared a gun violence emergency in his city. “We will not stop until we bring peace back to those Portland neighborhoods too often caught in the crossfire,” he said at a press conference on July 22. Portland is reeling from a combination of a crime spike, a large and growing homeless population, and the decimation of the local police department.

In 2020, Portland was rocked by months of protests and riots. Under pressure from the defund the police movement, the city government voted to cut its police budget. Subsequently, police officers fled their thankless jobs. Two hundred fifty of them have resigned or retired since July 2020, with more retirements expected this summer. This has left the Portland Police Department barely functioning.

From 2019 to 2020, Portland’s homicide rate jumped 83 percent, one of the largest increases of any city in America. More than 50 people have been shot so far this year, meaning the city is likely to overtake last year’s record of 90 homicides.

Portland is also facing a homelessness crisis. In 2019, there were 4,015 homeless people in the Portland metro area, but in 2022 this number had risen to 5,228, according to data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The struggles of First Orthodox Presbyterian Church are a microcosm of what has gone wrong in Portland. The church is located in northeast Portland, far from the epicenter of the 2020 protests, but the members feel the reverberations.

The church, which has about 150 members, has been meeting in the same building for 77 years, but the surrounding neighborhood has been deteriorating for some time. On the church’s block, there is a strip club, a methadone clinic, a food bank, and a seedy motel that church members believe serves as a hub of drug dealing and prostitution.

During the pandemic, however, the problems went into overdrive. A large drug-use camp developed on the street directly behind the church’s parking lot. Since last summer, four homicides have taken place there, prompting “The Oregonian” newspaper to dub it “Portland’s Deadliest Block.”

What do you do when your church is located on your city’s “deadliest block”? For starters, church leadership decided to hire private security. About a year and a half ago, they started paying a firm called Hawkeye Protection a monthly fee to make two stops on the church property each night. “If Hawkeye sees someone on the property, they will tell them that they are not allowed to stay there and then hang around until they leave the property,” said church member Jamie Bradshaw.

After several incidents, the church also reluctantly started locking its doors during services. “We try to keep the door locked during services so that we don’t have people wandering into the church. Three years ago, we would never even have considered leaving the outside doors locked,” Bradshaw explained. The church also recently installed security cameras.

But church members wanted to do more than just protect their building. They wanted to love their neighbors. Thus, they asked Portland Rescue Mission, a nonprofit that works with the homeless, for guidance on the best way to minister to the people who frequent the drug camp. “We want to help people who need help. And we wanted to have the right attitude about it,” insisted Bradshaw.

Portland Rescue Mission evaluated the camp but concluded it was purely a site for drug use. Unlike some homeless encampments, no one lived there. Bradshaw recounts that Portland Rescue Mission sent the church an email that said, “We’ve been doing an assessment of that homeless encampment. And, in our view, the best thing you can do is get them to leave because they’re dangerous. They’re not interested in getting help. And it’s not safe for you or the community to have a homeless encampment of that nature.”

In Portland, the police have the legal power to remove — or “sweep” — a homeless encampment that is located on public property. However, this was not a straightforward situation where the church could contact the police and set a date.

Police efforts to sweep homeless encampments are sometimes frustrated by homeless advocacy groups. These groups see sweeping as cruel and inhumane. If they find out about a sweep, they turn up to protest. “Our street behind our church and another section in Portland are two hot spots for shootings. And the police have a hard time dealing with the other hotspot because there are activists in that area,” Bradshaw said.

Before approaching the police, church members went door to door in the surrounding neighborhood to sound out residents. “We told them what we were going to do because we wanted to see what the reaction would be. We were looking for any elements in the neighborhood that would be allies to the homeless rights movement because they wouldn’t have approved,” said church member Mark McConnell. To the church’s relief, no one objected to sweeping the drug camp. “We found only support,” he affirmed.

At that point, the church reached out to the police, and McConnell said their assistance has been excellent. The police were happy to finally encounter a community that does not hate them and proceeded to sweep the camp. “They were hungry for a win,” McConnell said.

One police officer has now incorporated a drive through the church parking lot into his regular patrol route, which has been a big help to the church. “He’s found people sleeping on the back steps in the middle of the day, and he’ll just go up and tell them, ‘You can’t sleep here.’ And make them move along,” Bradshaw said.

After the drug camp was swept, the site needed heavy cleaning. Church members volunteered, but they asked Hawkeye Protection to send a guard to watch over them — primarily out of fear of activists turning up.

The church understands the structural factors that led to the drug camp are all still present. “The security people coming by and the police making frequent patrols are environmental steps. It doesn’t accomplish anything directly. It just says we have certain expectations for this place. And it probably doesn’t fit very well with drug dealing,” McConnell affirmed.

Lasting change will require a new attitude and probably new leadership in Portland. But in the meantime, the members of First Orthodox Presbyterian Church will have to cope as best they can.

Leftists Are Trying To Redefine Race Riots As Righteous Rebellions,"A St. Louis man was recently found guilty of murdering David Dorn, a retired police captain, during the riots and looting that broke out in the summer of 2020. But that doesn’t mean the wounds this country endured during that summer are healing. In fact, many on the left are actively working on gaslighting the American public about the nature of these riots and redefining the role that race riots play in our collective history.

The latest effort may be found in Elizabeth Hinton’s book, “America on Fire.” Hinton says the African American riots of the 1960s were really political protests. In fact, she goes much further and claims that all of the predominantly black disturbances since the ’60s were revolts against racial injustice. “The so-called urban riots from the 1960s to the present,” she says, “can only be properly understood as rebellions.”

This claim has won approval from the leftist media, and it might resonate with those who are intuitively sympathetic to the long black struggle for equal treatment, but it simply does not square with the facts.

Some of the more significant mass violence events were anguished cries in response to shocking events. The assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968, which touched off a spasm of violence, was one such event. In that same category are the fatal police beating of a black businessman in Miami in 1980 and the brutal police assault on Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992. One can debate whether the behaviors during the ensuing mass violence in Miami and Los Angeles should be called “riots.” However, the assault on innocents and the wanton destruction of property give credence to the designation.

It is nonetheless true that perceived racial injustices triggered these events. The same could be said about the violent events following the death of George Floyd in 2020. But going back to the events of the late 1960s, most disturbances had no clear cause or the incidents that triggered them were utterly banal and the responses totally disproportionate.

In one of the worst disturbances in 1967 in Detroit, where 43 people died in four nightmarish days of turmoil, the trigger was a police raid on a club serving alcohol after 2 a.m. in violation of state law. The club was located in a dingy second-floor apartment in a rundown black area of the city and had been raided several times before without incident. But it was unusually hot and crowded on the Saturday night when the violence began, and the raid ended in a melee. Crowds quickly formed outside as the arrestees were removed and two black youths urged the onlookers to violence. By 6 a.m., 30 windows had been broken, and looting had begun. The first store victimized was the black-owned Hardy’s Drug Store. By 8 a.m., the mob had swelled to 3,000, and the outnumbered police did nothing to stop the spreading window breaking and theft. Ultimately, 2,500 stores were looted, burned, or destroyed. Subsequent charges of police brutality during the raid never were substantiated.

Was this a rebellion? Clearly not. Whatever the initial resentment of the police raid, the subsequent behavior, mostly stealing and burning, was unquestionably a riot or a rampage without any political message. And there were hundreds more just like it in this period. A careful quantitative analysis by Susan Olzak and Suzanne Shanahan found that 60 percent of these events “had no clear-cut target or symbol,” and only 27 percent were in response to some police incident. Furthermore, another quantitative study found that economic conditions bore no relation to the disturbances. In his classic study of disorders in 673 cities between 1961 and 1968, Seymour Spilerman found that no deprivation factors were positively or strongly related to the violence.

The looting and burning of shops were not unusual behaviors in many of the areas where these violent events occurred. In Detroit, two-thirds of all arrests were for theft. In Newark, more than $8 million in inventory was lost due to stealing and damage to stock.

A quantitative study of shopkeepers in riot areas found that the rioters were selective, targeting the better quality stores. The quality of the merchandise had more salience in explaining the choice of targets than any other factor, including retaliation for perceived abuse by the merchant or sheer proximity to the civil disorder. Setting shops ablaze was common during the riots. In 1967 and 1968 alone, there were over 10,600 arson incidents. Even black store ownership afforded no protection. Approximately 27 percent of the stores destroyed in Detroit were owned by African Americans.

The 1960s were a period of great ferment when the youth of the day (the same Baby Boomers who are now passing from the scene) dominated both demographically and culturally. There were countless protests against the Vietnam War and overt Jim Crow racism. This rebellious atmosphere surely had something to do with urban violence.

But for African Americans, it also was a period of tremendous progress in terms of rights and economic benefits. Black family income had doubled since 1940. By 1970, black unemployment had fallen to a mere 4.2 percent, and poverty levels had sunk to 34 percent of the population. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations fully supported civil rights laws and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dealt a mortal blow to Jim Crow. Congress then passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ensuring African American influence in the political system. Johnson also got Congress to adopt his War on Poverty legislation which was intended to primarily benefit low-income African Americans. What a strange time for a “rebellion” If there was a broader underlying cause, raised expectations of immediate material gain is the most likely candidate.

Young black radicals espousing revolution provided a rationalization for the disturbances. H. Rap Brown, Stokely Carmichael, and the Black Panthers reaped great media attention with their inflammatory remarks. But they did not gain much traction with the average African American. When Carmichael spoke at Detroit’s Cobo Arena one year before the riot, 500-600 people heard him denounce moderate civil rights groups. Only a month earlier, Dr. King had preached nonviolence in the same 12,000-seat hall to a standing-room-only crowd. And in a 1968 poll of more than 5,000 people in 15 big cities found that only 15 percent of black respondents favored violence to gain rights, whereas 39 percent preferred laws and persuasion, and 38 percent favored nonviolent protest. Moreover, 90 percent of African Americans did not think that police brutality caused riots.

It’s understandable that the black public didn’t endorse violence. They paid a terrible price for the disorders. One careful analysis of the period 1964 through 1971 counted an extraordinary 752 riots, resulting in 228 deaths, 12,741 injuries, 69,099 arrests, and 15,835 incidents of arson. And this does not address the enormous monetary loss: the total destruction of businesses, mostly small shops; the concomitant loss of jobs; the millions expended by all levels of government in attempts to control the mayhem; and the millions more lost in tax revenues. Cities like Detroit and Newark took decades to recover; some say they never really recovered.

When the facts of mass violence are studied without ideological assumptions, the complexities become apparent. No one cause fits all, and the claim that they are all rebellions for racial justice is belied by the historical details. Mass looting for personal gain and aimless destruction are riots, not rebellions.

The Creepy Weirdness Of Democrats Is Best Understood When They Talk About Law Enforcement,"Nothing captures just how bizarre and unearthly Democrats have become than when they get to talking about police and law enforcement. (Their fixation with gender bending is a close second.)

It would honestly do them a lot of good to just stop discussing the issue altogether. You can see it on their faces how hard it is to articulate simple concepts like, “criminals should be in jail,” or, “police deserve respect.”

They would rather complicate the issue by talking about the history of slavery, “disadvantaged communities,” and — my favorite — systemic oppression.

All the data show that across the board, regardless of race, the overwhelming majority of police and civilian interactions are fine; that minorities call on cops for help at a far higher rate than whites; and that the chance of an unarmed black man being killed by police is next to nonexistent (and when such an incident does occur, it’s because he was resisting arrest or attempting to flee in a life-threatening, high-speed chase).

But liberals refuse to leave it alone, instead writhing in pain as they try to find some existential problem with our law enforcement.

To wit, New York Times columnist-in-training Charles Blow wrote Wednesday that former president Trump and his voters aren’t genuine supporters of the police—okay, whatever you say. But Blow couldn’t make the point without first offering a winding, tedious lecture on the theory of policing.

“In a system of accountability and consequences, there must be first points of contact, people who are charged with preventing and stopping the rule breaking,” he prattled. “In our society, those people are police officers. Their role, in the abstract, is essential. However, the way that we have constructed it is problematic.”

Recall Missouri Democrat Rep. Cori Bush, a champion of zeroing out police budgets, last year attempting to explain why she spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on private, armed security. “I have private security because my body is worth being on this planet right now,” she said, somehow, without laughing. “I have private security because they, the white supremacist, racist narrative that they drive into this country— the fact that they don’t care that this black woman that has put her life on the line— they can’t match my energy, first of all. This black woman who puts her life on the line. They don’t care that I could be taken out of here. They actually are probably okay with that. But this is the thing, I won’t let them get that off. You can’t get that off.”

That is a direct transcript of what she said on national television.

Listening to Democrats talk about law enforcement is like watching that “In Living Color” skit with the Oswald Bates character, a prisoner who confidently uses a slew of multisyllabic words that ultimately mean nothing, but he thinks he’s smart for using them anyway. (“First of all, we must internalize the flatulation of the matter by transmitting the effervescent of the Indonesian proximity in order to further segregate the crux of my venereal infection.”)

Free tip for Democrats: Really just shut up. You’ve turned all of our big cities into war zones where theft and vandalism continue with impunity in no small part because a fentanyl addict died in a freak accident. No matter how you cut it, no matter how complicated you try to make it, law enforcement is not your issue and you’re scaring everyone.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/30/the-creepy-weirdness-of-democrats-is-best-understood-when-they-talk-about-law-enforcement/,2022-07-30
British Veteran Arrested For Reposting Meme That 'Caused Anxiety',"British veteran Darren Brady said Hampshire police were “impeding his right to free speech” by tracking him down for reposting a meme featuring the LGBT “pride” flag arranged in the shape of a swastika.

In viral footage of the arrest taken by political activist Laurence Fox who created the meme, officers tell the 51-year-old at his residence in Aldershot that “someone has been caused anxiety based on your social media post. That is why you have been arrested.”

https://twitter.com/thereclaimparty/status/1553383256439115776?s=20&t=52NbOB1HhUgDyRESuPn8ag

A spokeswoman for the Hampshire Constabulary told The Federalist that officers confronted Brady following a report “that an offensive image had been shared online.” It is unclear who filed the report but officers visited Brady’s home to “establish the exact circumstances around the social media post.”

Harry Miller, a former police officer and Bad Law Project CEO who was also arrested, said police first tried to “extort” Brady by demanding he “pay around £80 for educational course so he could downgrade from a crime to a non-crime, which would still show up in a basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.”

That’s why when officers promised to return on July 28 to hear Brady’s final answer about “re-education,” both Fox and Miller were on the scene to document what Miller dubbed the “world’s worst shakedown.” When officers arrived at Brady’s house for a second time, the police spokeswoman said “they were prevented from entering the address to discuss a potential resolution to the matter.”

“As a result, officers felt it was necessary to arrest a man at the scene so they could interview him in relation to the alleged offence,” the spokeswoman continued. She also said a 57-year-old man, whom the Daily Mail identified as Miller, was “arrested on suspicion of obstructing/resisting a constable in execution of duty.”

“He was released under investigation, and our enquiries are ongoing. Due to this being a live investigation we cannot comment further,” the spokeswoman said.

Officers claimed to be “investigating an alleged offence under Section 127 of the Communications Act (2003),” a sweeping law that gives the United Kingdom government the authority to imprison someone if officials deem his online posts “grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character,” or if he knowingly makes a false post “for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another.”

The spokeswoman made it clear that “no further action is being taken” against Brady but maintains that officers “come to work every day to protect the public” and were “acting in good faith” when they singled out Brady.

“We are engaging further with our police and crime commissioner to make sure that we deploy our resource in a way that reflects need in our local communities,” she concluded.

Donna Jones, the Hampshire police and crime commissioner, issued a statement criticizing her own force and voicing concern “about both the proportionality and necessity of the police’s response to this incident.”

“When incidents on social media receive not one but two visits from police officers, but burglaries and non-domestic break-ins don’t always get a police response, something is wrong,” Jones said before promising to write the College of Policing asking for “greater clarification” on how police should respond “more appropriately in the future.”

That hasn’t stopped free speech critics such as Caroline Russell, a member of the Police and Crime Committee in the Greater London Authority, from demanding police “look into Laurence Fox using pride flags to create nazi imagery and posting the images on a public platform.”

“This is a hate crime,” Russell tweeted.

Grisham Ad Falsely Claims GOP Opponent Aims To Defund Police,"Image Credit Michelle Lujan Grisham / YouTube

New Mexico Democrat Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has a new ad out this week that even the local press has reported takes her Republican opponent “wildly out of context.”

On Tuesday, the Alburquerque-based television station KOB4 published a fact-check of Grisham’s latest campaign ad titled “Law Enforcement,” which depicts former local meteorologist and GOP gubernatorial nominee Mark Ronchetti as a proponent of efforts to defund police.

“Keeping New Mexicans safe is part of the governor’s job,” says a narrator. “But Mark Ronchetti will slash budgets for police and law enforcement agencies in every corner of New Mexico.”

The ad then prominently displays the text, “Mark Ronchetti is promising to defund the police.”

The Grisham campaign then airs its evidence for the attack with a clip from Ronchetti at a Republican primary debate with another local Alburquerque station where the eventual nominee claims New Mexico police aren’t asking for more money and firearms.

“They don’t want more money. They don’t want more guns,” Ronchetti said.

KOB4 concluded, however, that “the snippet is wildly out of context.”

Below is an expanded transcript of Ronchetti’s answer:

We have to back the blue. We have to tell them we will support them no matter what they need from us. We have some of the best law enforcement in the country here. And when you ask them, ‘What do you need? What would help you?’ the answer is simple: They don’t want more money. They don’t want more guns. They want to know that the governor of the State of New Mexico and their leaders backs them up.

Nowhere did Ronchetti endorse efforts to strip resources from law enforcement as depicted by Grisham’s campaign ad. Ronchetti’s own crime plan on his campaign website even includes a section to “Fund and Support Police.”

Distorting Ronchetti’s broader platform was not the only item Grisham’s ad got wrong. The governor’s commercial also attacked Ronchetti for his opposition to her budget proposing 16 percent raises for state police. The ad highlighted a July tweet from Ronchetti in which he criticized the $8.5 billion budget but said nothing of police raises.

The governor’s office noted in a press release the raises will cost $9 million over the fiscal year, amounting to one-tenth of 1 percent of the total budget.

In response to the ad, the Republican Governor’s Association (RGA) has been quick to criticize the incumbent Grisham, who is seen as one of Democrats’ most vulnerable governors up for re-election in November.

“Michelle Lujan Grisham does not have any accomplishments to run on so she resorts to flagrant lies about Mark Ronchetti to try to prop herself up,” RGA spokesman Will Reinert said. “No person in their right mind, including the state’s Fraternal Order of Police, thinks Ronchetti doesn’t support law enforcement. Governor Lujan Grisham must apologize to voters for her deceit.”

Police Will Keep Quitting Until Leftists Stop Neutering Them,"The New York Police Department (NYPD) is experiencing a record number of resignations. As of June 2022, more than 1,500 officers have either resigned or retired. This marks “the largest exodus of officers since the statistics have been available,” according to the New York Post.

An August report noted that many of New York’s finest are quitting before they even get their pensions. Oakland, California, is also experiencing a record number of police departures, according to a report from March. And last month, the entire police force of Kenly, North Carolina, quit.

Across the country, America is witnessing the same trend: Police forces are having unprecedented, catastrophic problems with retaining personnel. Consequently, homicide numbers for the first half of 2022, based on data from 23 cities, are 39 percent higher than they were in the same time period of 2019, according to a July report in Time magazine.

What is going on?

The Predictable Progressive Playbook

Much of the blame seems to lie at the feet of progressive politicians and police chiefs who were installed to “reform” police departments following widespread calls to “defund the police” in the aftermath of the 2020 death of George Floyd. Media reports indicate these ideologues are applying the same blinkered, anti-racist, leftist strategies across the country, with predictable results.

Take Charlottesville, Virginia, which hired RaShall Brackney, its first black female police chief, following waves of violence in 2017 “to restore public trust” in the city’s police force. A self-described “liberal Democrat,” Brackney implemented radical change by disbanding highly coveted special units and taking disciplinary action against six members of the city’s SWAT team, which she later disbanded.

Many officers called Brackney “heavy-handed,” and her leadership style was alienating. Mike Wells, president of the Central Virginia chapter of the Police Benevolent Association, noted the city’s force has “lost faith” in Brackney. A survey of the entire force found that an overwhelming majority of officers distrusted her. She resigned last year.

In New York, officers have cited “anti-cop hostility, bail reform, and rising crime” as reasons for quitting. “The city is out of control — especially since bail reform,” according to a former cop from Queens. This same officer told the New York Post that a common ethos is “get out while you still can.”

New York City even has a council member who has demanded the “racist”’ NYPD be closed down. And last week, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the U.S. House who represents parts of New York City, further delayed a public-safety bill that would have provided fund grants for local police departments to bring on new hires. AOC is a longtime proponent of defunding the NYPD.

In Oakland, a police union has blamed the recent exodus of officers on the lack of support from the Oakland City Council. “Just stop the rhetoric,” urged Oakland officer and president of the police union Barry Donelan in a recent letter. “Don’t blame Oakland Police Officers for everything that ills Oakland. That’s what we see from the council on a regular basis.”

In Kenly, North Carolina, the entire police force resigned in July in response to the town’s “progressively responsible” town manager — whom police chief Josh Gibson accused of creating a “hostile work environment.” And in Hillsborough County, Florida, State Attorney Andrew Warren developed a reputation for letting criminals go and not prosecuting crimes, angering police and leading Gov. Ron DeSantis to remove him from his post earlier this month.

Condescension Comes from Ideology

The bevy of nonsensical police reforms pushed for by leftists reveals the left’s blatant disrespect for America’s police forces.

Leftists have been downplaying their “defund the police” rhetoric for many months, given the alarming rise in crime across the country, especially in increasingly unpoliced urban areas. “Even Democrats are now admitting ‘Defund the Police’ was a massive mistake,” wrote CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza last November. But recrafted messaging can’t disguise the fact that the left’s ideology is one inherently at odds with what American police forces represent.

Police forces are necessary to address crime and in upholding equality before the law. And given that a disproportionate amount of crime occurs in black communities and is committed by black criminals, police officers will spend a disproportionate amount of their time addressing issues that arise in these communities.

But left-wing ideology, which is now fully under the sway of anti-racism ideologues, demands that the country’s police departments must be dismantled.

Police work is also inherently violent and physically coercive, which is why it’s no surprise that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers nationally.

Policing naturally lends itself to men because it is a profession that demands a high degree of physical and mental tenacity that is most readily found in those with high testosterone and who are physically able to engage wild drunks, abusive boyfriends, and the mentally unstable. Yet liberal ideology indicts men who manifest such traits as guilty of “toxic masculinity,” “heteronormativity,” and perpetuating “the patriarchy.”

In other words, as much the left tries to present itself as pro-police, its underlying ideology is decidedly against them, their identity, and their mission. Thus even when they don’t defund them, they can’t help but lecture them about how terrible they are.

In May, Adam Graham, a mayor from the state of Oklahoma, aggressively confronted two police officers in the middle of a routine traffic stop because he assumed they were engaged in racial profiling of a black driver despite one of the officers being black.

Until the left departs from its radical racial ideology, police officers will keep departing from their jurisdictions.

"Two Years Later, It's Time For A J6-Style Probe Of Kenosha Riots","Aug. 23, 2020 is a night Kenosha residents can’t help but remember — but would rather forget. At the hands of vindictive Black Lives Matter groupies and other self-described racial justice activists, the Wisconsin town went up in flames two years ago today.

Rogues started fires at government buildings. They set ablaze garbage trucks and torched upwards of 100 vehicles in the car lot owned by an Indian immigrant, smashing the windows of those who escaped the inferno. They vandalized the post office and a high school, and their flames completely consumed a century-old camera shop.

That’s only a fraction of what followed the justified police shooting of Jacob Blake.

A whole car lot was set ablaze overnight in the #BlackLivesMatter riot in Kenosha, Wisc. pic.twitter.com/ZNGtqFEOa0 — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) August 24, 2020

Boarded up windows were scrawled with messages begging rioters to pass over them: “PLEASE, KIDS ABOVE” and “THE ELDERLY LIVE HERE.” Demonstrators taunted the scant law enforcers posted outside the courthouse. And when Wisconsin’s Democrat Gov. Tony Evers refused to send enough National Guardsmen after a full 24 hours of rioting despite locals’ pleas for help — he sent more troops to Milwaukee during the NBA finals — armed citizens stepped up to defend property and ultimately themselves, resulting in the deaths of two people.

That was two years ago. Now we’re watching the House Jan. 6 Committee’s Stalinist show trial for Americans who participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol — and many who didn’t — on Jan. 6, 2021. Last November, we witnessed a courtroom drama for a 17-year-old kid who defended his life with a firearm during the riots but was slandered by legacy media as a white supremacist and a murderer.

Now, after more than 60 people have been charged with crimes related to the Kenosha riots, with supposedly many more to come, why has there been no large-scale investigation into these deadly riots, the players behind them, and the destructive ideology that sparked it all? Despite Democrats’ constant talk about Donald Trump’s “big lie,” they fall silent when confronted with evidence their race obsession can spur lethal race revolutions.

That obsession and its effects are based on a lie. And it’s a big one.

The Big Lie

The entire Kenosha scene was sparked by one police shooting, which corporate media and other leftists instantly branded evidence of racism. Celebrities claimed, contrary to available evidence, that police “shoot first & detain second” and that Blake “could have been grabbed…he could have been tased….He could have immediately been stopped when he started walking around the car.” LeBron James characterized it as “police brutality towards my kind.”

Evers framed the incident as yet another “Black man or person” “shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement.” Joe Biden escalated the race-baiting with the same framing.

Of course, this was all a lie. Police were actually responding to an emergency call from Blake’s girlfriend, who said he wasn’t permitted on the property and had snatched her keys. Before officers even arrived at the scene, they knew Blake had a warrant out for his arrest for charges of disorderly conduct connected to domestic abuse, third-degree sexual assault, and trespassing. Before they ever fired a gun, officers had Tased him twice to no avail, and Blake had reached into the vehicle, where a weapon was later recovered on the floorboards and three kids were in the backseat, which police knew because their mom reportedly “kept screaming that.”

But this lie — that the Blake shooting represented routine police brutality toward black people — is not surprising because it’s all part of the left’s much bigger racism lie.

They lied about knife-wielding black teen Ma’Khia Bryant. They lied about armed 13-year-old Mexican-American Adam Toledo. They lied about Michael Brown. They lied about Bubba Wallace and Jussie Smollett. And they lie by omission when they refuse to cover violent crimes by black perpetrators against other racial groups, as with Pakistani immigrant Mohammad Anwar, who was brutally murdered by two black teenage girls when they violently carjacked him in D.C. in the middle of the day.

They perpetuate these lies with catchphrases, such as “hands up, don’t shoot.” They spread them in ahistorical accounts such as the “1619 Project” and profit from them with lectures lamenting “white fragility” and “systemic racism.” And they amplify them with clever branding such as “Black Lives Matter,” making violent demonstrations tricky to condemn for those afraid of false racism smears.

Corrupt media are the worst offenders, and Democrat politicos are nearly as bad. As I wrote last year about the left’s response to riots:

It’s this endless stream of lies that incites the sort of violence that overtook Kenosha. Years later, why hasn’t it been investigated?

We Need Answers

I’m not talking about the type of local investigations that led to charging a few dozen people with riot-related crimes. That should be a given. I’m talking about a large-scale probe that drags in media defamers, a negligent governor, elite race-baiters, and riot organizers to investigate their role in this violent scene, which has played out time and again with impunity across the country.

After all, there’s precedent for that sort of trial. It arose from a riot on Jan. 6, which was far less deadly than Kenosha and was used to destroy top political opponents whose hands are clean, unlike those of Wisconsin’s dud governor.

First, we still don’t know who was responsible for the rioting because it appears to be more than just individual Kenoshans. Kenosha locals were the first to tell The Federalist that the perpetrators were “out-of-towners.” As one local, Alvin, told The Federalist at the time, “All this destruction didn’t come from Kenosha. People came in here and did this.”

Alvin was with his young daughter, Kaya, after visiting and “shedding tears” with the son of a shop owner whose business was destroyed. “All this destruction didn’t come from Kenosha,” he said, “People came in here and did this.” pic.twitter.com/STk5wWTWaS — The Federalist (@FDRLST) August 27, 2020

Police reports bear this out. According to a media release one week after the riots began, of the 175 people who had been arrested, 102 were out-of-towners. Leftist media, of course, sicced their fake fact-checkers on the information, with USA Today saying those figures are “missing context” because most of the arrestees were from other parts of Wisconsin or Illinois, “the border of which is about 6 miles from the heart of the protests.”

Leftist media discarded this “context,” however, when they attacked Kyle Rittenhouse for traveling “across state lines” from Illinois with a gun (This was a lie anyway. He didn’t bring the firearm across state lines, and both Rittenhouse’s father and lifeguarding job were reportedly in Kenosha.).

As Empower Wisconsin reporter Matt Kittle detailed, police also stopped a bus containing Seattle-based group Riot Kitchen in Kenosha after they filled up multiple gas cans. While media were quick to parrot the group’s excuse that they needed the gasoline to power generators, that leaves bigger questions unanswered.

“Police say the vehicles contained various items, including helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, and suspected controlled substances. Nine individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct and are awaiting charging decisions by the Kenosha County district attorney, according to the incident report,” Kittle reported at the time. “…What the [media] stories couldn’t explain is why members of the organization were loading up so many cans of gas, and why the Riot Kitchen crew in the minivan fled from police.”

Sure sounds like something a Select Committee on Aug. 23 might want to get to the bottom of. What was Riot Kitchen really doing in Kenosha, what percentage of the rioters came from out of state, and who funded their activities? What about the rioters who descended from Oregon, California, Kentucky, Minnesota, Indiana, and California? Where else did demonstrators come from, and did someone send them?

If it’s true, as Molly Ball admitted in a jaw-dropping Time magazine article about the rigged 2020 election, that alliances of left-wing activists and corporate power players can control so-called “protests,” which of these puppet-masters were involved in coordinating the Kenosha riots? If none of those people actively instigated these riots, why didn’t they work to “curtail” them, as Ball says they’re able to do, before they turned violent?

Furthermore, partisans on the Jan. 6 Committee squeezed every last salacious soundbite possible out of texts to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to tell the president to stop the riots. But what about Evers’ text messages? Who advised the governor to twiddle his thumbs rather than call in reinforcements? What was the chatter like after that negligence led to shots fired?

And how about communication among members of the slanderous media? Which editors and producers greenlighted the framing of the Blake shooting as police brutality and the ensuing violence as “fiery but mostly peaceful“? Which publishers have so far been held accountable for printing that Rittenhouse is a murderer? Perhaps President Joe Biden should be called to testify before a committee for labeling the teen a “white supremacist” — or have his home raided to fish for any scrap of paper where he might have scribbled a Kenosha-related note.

Justice for All

As the Jan. 6 Committee subpoenas fellow lawmakers, indicts political opponents, and throws 69-year-old grandmothers with cancer into federal prison for trespassing, two years have passed without any probe of the big racism lie that incited mob violence in Kenosha.

It’s clear what ideology led to the riots. It’s not clear to what extent individual players are responsible. Perhaps it’s time to assemble an Aug. 23 Select Committee that, instead of engaging in partisan theater, actually gets to the bottom of the violence to provide justice for victims and to prevent this nightmare from repeating itself.

The American people might actually tune in to a trial like that. They’ve been waiting a while for answers.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/23/two-years-after-kenosha-riots-why-no-august-23-committee-to-investigate-the-big-lie-that-stoked-the-flames/,2022-08-23
Guru Behind AZ Dem's Campaign To Be State's Top Law Enforcer Hates Cops,"A campaign associate for Democrat Kris Mayes, who is running to be Arizona’s top law enforcer, hates the police.

Since the summer of 2020, social media posts show Stacey Champion, a Democratic political consultant who helps represent Mayes’ attorney general campaign to the press, deriding police as “racist” stormtroopers hellbent on killing black people.

“We live in a country where ‘law enforcement’ = killing black folks and arresting women who need to buy tampons,” Champion wrote on her personal Twitter account in response to one post alleging such an episode. “That pretty much sums it up.”

Another post in March of last year complained that “the FBI wants to protect racist cops.”

The post came in response to a podcast on FBI Director Christopher Wray refusing regular briefings on the Capitol riot, the same riot where bureau informants were reportedly involved. The extent of their involvement, however, has been concealed by the agency. FBI leadership has also colluded with the House Select Committee on Jan. 6 and refused to offer House Republicans the same materials presented to Democrats.

In a statement to The Federalist, Champion tried to distance herself from the campaign. Yet her own firm created Mayes’ campaign website, which directs “press inquiries” to Champion. Champion has also previously described herself as “all in” to elect Mayes.

“I am not a ‘campaign spokeswoman,'” Champion told The Federalist. “My tweets represent my personal opinions, not the opinion of anyone else, as can be seen in my bio.”

In October, Champion went after former Arizona Republican Senate candidate Justin Olson for his push back against left-wing demands to “defund the police.”

“Our police officers put their lives on the line every day to ensure our safety,” Olson wrote on Twitter. “Without them, our communities wouldn’t be safe.”

Champion then attacked him for being white, writing, “Spoken like a true white guy politician trying to drum up campaign contributions.”

Last August, Champion accused an off-duty police officer of being responsible for the death of a Boston woman who got separated from him on a nearby hiking trail. According to a local NBC affiliate, the death of 31-year-old tourist Angela Tramonte was determined to be caused by accidental heat exposure after she failed to return to the vehicle.

“The officer said Tramonte was supposed to meet him back at the car, but at 1 p.m. he called 911 because he couldn’t find her,” Arizona 12News reported.

“I do not believe that this cop isn’t culpable,” Champion claimed without evidence on Twitter.

Officers who defend themselves, meanwhile, are guilty in Champion’s eyes.

In May, Champion condemned an officer shooting of a man who allegedly lunged at police with a machete.

Another tweet reviled officers who fatally shot a man who “charged at them with a metal tool.”

While Champion roundly condemns police, one post suggested police should descend on white maskless people who were outdoors protesting pandemic restrictions in the summer of 2020.

“Where are the police in riot gear, tear gas & rubber bullets?!?” Champion asked in a tweet. “Nothing could be more dangerous than a white person refusing to wear a mask.”

Other posts from the Democrat attorney general campaign’s spokeswoman have emphasized “environmental racism” and demanded “climate action” in the name of “public health & BIPOC.” BIPOC is a popular left-wing acronym for “black, indigenous, and people of color.”

In November, Mayes faces Republican attorney Abe Hamadeh, who captured the GOP nomination for attorney general in a crowded August primary with more than 33 percent of the vote.

Out Of Control Crime Threatens To Bury Democrats In November,"All across the country, Americans are struggling to cope with a new era of violent crime.

Urban hubs such as Philadelphia are expected to surpass last year’s record-high homicides tally. Chicago residents can expect hundreds more killings before the end of the year. In California, smash-and-grab robberies are the new normal, while the number of break-ins and thefts in Las Vegas are on the up, embracing a whole new identity of what it means to be “Sin City.”

As police agencies shrink amid low funding and community support while the southern border remains wide open for terrorists and cartels, cities famous for their tourism and sightseeing have now been rendered unsafe.

This rise in violence could impact how voters cast their ballots in key battleground states this November, especially since Democrats have made defunding police and affordable bail for violent criminals central to their platforms.

It’s not hard for Americans to see that many of these crime waves are exacerbated by the lax criminal policies adopted by blue bureaucrats. Even polls, often manipulated by their corporate sponsors to reinforce pre-determined narratives, show that voters trust Republicans far more than Democrats to address their top concerns about the economy, inflation, and rising crime. According to an ABC News/Ipsos survey out last month, 32 percent of U.S. adults said Republicans would do a better job at handling crime, while only 21 percent said the same of Democrats. Thirty-five percent held no faith in either.

Voters have good reason, however, to trust Republicans when it comes to cleaning up crime in their neighborhoods when considering Democrats created the crisis in their communities today.

Democrat Legislatures Bring ‘The Purge’ From Hollywood Fantasy To Main Street Reality

The nation’s rising crime is no spontaneous trend happening by coincidence. The crime surge is a direct consequence of Democrat-controlled legislatures passing bill after bill to enable criminal behavior with heavier restrictions on police and lower penalties for delinquents.

In Washington, state Democrats barred high-speed pursuits except under extremely limited circumstances, such as suspicion of impaired driving or probable cause that the culprit is an escaped fugitive or was involved in a violent crime. The law was passed last year as part of a police reform package in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death the year prior.

“Since January of this year, more than 900 drivers have failed to stop for a Washington State Patrol trooper trying to pull them over,” the Northwest News Network reported in May. “The patrol and other police agencies around the state say they’ve never seen such blatant disregard for their lights and sirens.”

According to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, this summer, violent crime saw a more than 12 percent spike in 2021 from 2020, including 325 murders. The state lost nearly 500 officers at the same time.

In neighboring Oregon, state policymakers eliminated cash bail requirements for a series of offenses and reduced juvenile sentences. The state ranks 5th in the nation for carjackings, while Portland, Oregon’s largest city, saw a more than 200 percent murder spike last year from 2019.

Further south in Nevada, Democrats passed legislation to prohibit officers from arresting those charged with non-violent misdemeanors with few exceptions. Passed in September, the law became effective in October. Residents and businesses, including enterprises on the Las Vegas strip, are now suffering a sharp rise in property crime, which is up 15 percent from August last year.

Colorado Democrats passed a law in 2020 mandating police officers to intervene in certain circumstances related to colleague misbehavior with criminal consequences if they don’t. The law has made it easier to sue police officers directly while adding new restrictions in a blow to officer morale. Colorado has the third highest crime rate in the nation and leads in U.S. car thefts, with 661 per 100,000 vehicles stolen last year.

In Minnesota, Democrats rejected Republicans’ $200 million public safety package to invest in recruiting and retaining more police officers with resources to crack down on carjackings and repeat offenders. Instead, Democrats opted for a bill to provide police body cameras and embrace a “community-centered” approach to violent crime as opposed to stiffer penalties.

According to Neighborhood Scout, “Minneapolis has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes – from the smallest towns to the very largest cities.”

Democrat Politicians Can’t Escape Their Own Crime Wave

Even Democrat politicians have not escaped the crime wave sweeping their neighborhoods. Last week, Congresswoman Karen Bass, who is running for Los Angeles mayor, said her home was burglarized and two guns were stolen.

“LAPD was called, and I appreciate their assistance. At this time, it appears that only two firearms, despite being safely and securely stored, were stolen,” the Bass campaign said in a statement. “Cash, electronics, and other valuables were not. It’s unnerving and, unfortunately, it’s something that far too many Angelenos have faced.”

According to Fox News, data in April showed L.A. robberies up nearly 19 percent from last year, with car thefts up 40 percent, violent crime up more than 7 percent, and shootings up nearly 70 percent.

L.A. election officials, however, refused to place a referendum for the county’s leftist top prosecutor on the ballot this summer, claiming nearly 200,000 of the more than 715,000 signatures gathered were invalid. Only 566,857 were needed to force a recall. District Attorney George Gascon, who has frustrated residents with leniency for juveniles and refusal to pursue sentencing enhancements, will continue to serve through 2024.

In Philadelphia and Chicago, two democrats, a congresswoman and a state senator who support left-wing criminal justice reform were also each carjacked last year. In July, Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal was threatened by a man outside her Washington home.

Democrats Double Down

Instead of working to address voters’ concerns about crime in their communities, Democrats are doubling down on these soft-on-crime, defund the police policies, the candidates that parrot them, and siccing the FBI on the former president.

Just last week, President Joe Biden praised Wisconsin Democrat Senate nominee Mandela Barnes, who has a long history of calls for defunding the police, ending cash bail, and a vocal desire to abolish ICE in tweets.

Barnes joins a whole host of Democrat candidates, including Sens. Raphael Warnock and Mark Kelly who have shown their contempt for keeping voters safe by voting against Republican amendments designed to keep crime at bay, including increasing funding for law enforcement.

In former Chief Justice of North Carolina Cheri Beasley’s case, she ruled against the American people by letting child predators off the hook and murderers scheduled for the death penalty with lesser punishment.

In Pennsylvania, where voters say the economy, inflation, and crime, are their top issues, Democratic Senate nominee and current Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he wants to cut the prison population by a third. He also recently endorsed Philadelphia’s District Attorney Larry Krasner, who Pennsylvania Republicans threatened to impeach over his failure to properly address violent crime and who lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed to hold in contempt.

Meanwhile, Republicans led by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, plan to introduce new legislation aimed at reinforcing the need for rule of law on U.S. streets. Blackburn said in a tv appearance on Wednesday that includes “grants for law enforcement, more resources for law enforcement, for fighting some of these drug cases, fentanyl that get into the hands of gangs and cause additional problems in the cities.”

The legislative move comes shortly after two fatal crimes in her home state of Tennessee, including the brutal murder of a mother on a jog and the deaths of four people at the hands of a deranged shooter who live-streamed his killing spree, drew the attention of the country. Both of the alleged murderers were career criminals who were let out of prison early.

“We need tough-on-crime prosecutors, DAs. If you do the crime, you need to do the time,” Blackburn said in the teaser for her legislation.

Progressive prosecutors and weak-on-crime officials are fighting for violent criminals that are taking over our streets.

Anti-Cop Mandela Barnes Spent Over $600K On Personal Security,"Wisconsin’s Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is running against incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson in the U.S. Senate race this November, has quite a radical track record of opposing law enforcement. But in keeping with the Democrats’ hierarchical protection-for-me-but-not-for-thee framework, Barnes has reportedly spent more than half a million in taxpayer dollars for personal security to keep himself safe, prompting Wisconsin Republican audit committee leaders to launch an investigation.

Barnes has reportedly “averaged more than 13½ hours of security protection a day — including weekdays, weekends and holidays” during his first three years as lieutenant governor, racking up a total cost of $608,528 for a total of 14,370 hours of security from January 2019 to November 20, 2021. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel pointed out, at a cost of $660 a day for patrol officer wages, Barnes has used “more than 10 times the number of hours of security detail that [his predecessor Lt. Gov. Rebecca] Kleefisch received during her entire second term from 2015-’18. The total number of hours of protection that Kleefisch had over that four-year period was 1,377, an average of less than one hour per day.”

Wisconsin state Sen. Robert Cowles, R-Green Bay, and Rep. John Macco, R-Ledgeview, have requested security cost figures for both Barnes and Democrat Gov. Tony Evers from State Patrol Superintendent Tim Carnahan. The state lawmakers have also asked for information about how the level of security provided by the Dignitary Protection Unit for events is determined and details about security processes for political and private events. Carnahan has until Oct. 6 to respond.

Johnson spokesman Alec Zimmerman said he hopes the investigation sheds light on the truth, adding, “Wisconsin taxpayers deserve answers as to why Lt. Gov. Barnes had the audacity to push the defund the police movement while at the same time using State Patrol as his personal Uber service.”

Though Barnes has recently tried his best to distance himself from the extreme “defund the police” position, his past tweets and endorsements suggest sympathy for the radicalism. For instance, Barnes has called Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat who pushed to dismantle the Minneapolis police department, “brilliant.” His speaking engagements have included groups that back the anti-police movement — and have subsequently endorsed him. In fact, several national police-defunding groups have endorsed Barnes. And his tweets indicate he supports the “defund the police” movement, or at least believes it to be reasonable.

In a 2020 PBS interview, Barnes reportedly suggested taking money from police budgets and instead dumping it into vague community “programming” and “neighborhood services.” And last fall, he hosted a fundraiser in Wisconsin’s capital city, which Federalist contributor M.D. Kittle referred to as “featuring some of the most radical leftists in Wisconsin” and “a who’s who in the Madison defund-the-police movement.”

The U.S. Senate candidate was also photographed holding up a T-shirt that said “Abolish ICE,” which is an anti-law enforcement effort that seeks to remove ICE and border security in the name of human rights.

That isn’t the extent of Barnes’ law enforcement-related scandals, however. After the Barnes campaign released a list of the candidate’s law enforcement endorsements, two officers’ names were later removed, with both of them saying they never publicly endorsed him in the first place. Zimmerman said these “repeated lies are an attempt to distract from his support for defunding the police and abolishing ICE.”

Considering all of the law enforcement-related controversies involving Barnes, one thing is clear: The Democrat at best thinks your police department should be stripped of some of its resources that help keep you safe — maybe more — but is happy to use your tax dollars for his own personal safety.

Actual Police Endorse Johnson After Barnes Faked Police Support,"The Milwaukee Police Association on Monday endorsed pro-law enforcement Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., for the November election, expressing their support for the incumbent over his anti-police opponent, Democrat Mandela Barnes.

“During these increasingly trying times, the over 1,400 men and women of the Milwaukee Police Association appreciate leaders like you who are willing to stand and be an advocate for Law Enforcement Professionals,” the Milwaukee Police Association wrote in its endorsement letter.

Johnson has made his pro-law-enforcement stance quite clear throughout his time in Congress. The senator has advocated for “better fund[ing]” for police, saying it’s dangerous for communities and police when law enforcement is “understaffed or defunded.” During National Police Week this past May, the Wisconsin senator stated, “With crime reaching record highs across the country and the increase in officers killed on the job, the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities deserve our support. Their heroism keeps our families safe and we thank the officers for their service.”

Johnson has also spoken out against the rise in crime perpetuated by “radical left, soft on crime policies,” stressing the need for strong police throughout Wisconsin. “It’s because the policies, the rhetoric of the radical left is dispiriting law enforcement. Who is going to keep us safe? How can we expect to protect our citizens in our communities if we attack the police? If we propose defunding?” Johnson said.

Just last month, Sen. Johnson hosted a roundtable on U.S. border security, drawing attention to the failed border policies of the Biden administration and voicing his support for secure borders through law enforcement.

Barnes — Johnson’s opponent for the November election — has quite a track record of opposing law enforcement. “Defunding the police only dreams of being as radical as a Donald Trump pardon,” Barnes tweeted in 2020, implying either his support for the “defund the police” movement or at least his belief that this radical stance is non-extremist. Barnes has also been photographed holding a T-shirt that says “Abolish ICE,” an anti-law enforcement movement that supports dismantling border security in the name of protecting human rights.

Despite his attempts to distance himself from “defund the police” and other anti-law-enforcement movements, Barnes has received multiple endorsements from groups that advocate for these policies. And when Barnes’ campaign released a list of his law enforcement endorsements, two of the names were removed, with those police officers stating they never endorsed him.

After seeing the rise in crime as a result of failed left-wing policies, Wisconsin law enforcers know that supporting a candidate like Barnes will not improve the safety of their state. That’s why a more than 1,400-member police association enthusiastically backs Johnson — while his opponent fakes police endorsements.

Ben Crump thinks he has another George Floyd on his hands,"Benjamin Crump must be getting desperate. He’s not only defending drug-addled miscreants in his grand race hustle but now a man who randomly choked a woman.

Crump parachuted into Little Rock, Arkansas, this week to host a press conference calling on the Biden Justice Department to investigate the death of 30-year-old black man Terence Caffey, who died in December last year while in police custody.

Crump apparently thinks he’s got a winner on his hands because, like George Floyd, patron saint of Hennepin County, video footage of Caffey’s arrest shows him pinned to the ground saying he can’t breathe shortly before dying. But unlike the Floyd footage, the Caffey tape shows him attacking workers at a movie theater for no reason and then fighting police officers who were trying to subdue him.

Security cameras caught the entire thing. Caffey is first seen exiting a theater into a hallway at Movie Tavern around 9:30 p.m. A second person joins him for a moment before Caffey pulls on a different door that doesn’t open. A staff member then enters the scene and Caffey quickly approaches him, puts his hand on the staff member’s chest, and then goes around his back to put his hands around him from behind like a hug. Two others exit the same theater into the hall and then more staff appear, at which point Caffey walks on his own to a wall and slides down to sit.

There is now some kind of commotion with staff members moving about, one of them directly speaking with Caffey, who remains seated. The staff member walks a few steps away from Caffey and speaks into a walkie-talkie, before posting up against the wall opposite of him. Caffey then starts pulling things from his pockets and tossing them across the floor as he continues to sit.

Another staff member, who is black, then enters the scene, at which point Caffey jumps to his feet and lunges at him. A separate member on staff, who is also black, gets between the two and attempts to push Caffey back. A struggle ensues with multiple staff members attempting to subdue Caffey.

Caffey is then seen kicking one of them and is eventually brought to the ground, with multiple staff members on top of him before a security guard arrives. The crowd breaks and the guard, an off-duty cop, attempts to put Caffey in handcuffs. Caffey jumps up and tries to escape, first bumping into a wall and then falling again to the floor. He gets up once more and faces the guard who advances on Caffey, eventually getting him back on the floor. Caffey continues to struggle and multiple staff members attempt to secure his flailing hands and legs.

Several minutes later, two police officers arrive and manage to quickly cuff Caffey’s hands behind his back, while he remains lying face down. Everyone else stands up and Caffey is eventually seated against a wall.

More officers arrive and two hoist Caffey to his feet to walk him outside. That concludes the theater’s security footage. But wait! Thanks to Crump, there’s more!

Crump called for the police department to release the officers’ body camera footage as well. And so they did.

When the police arrived and Caffey was cuffed, seated upright against the wall, he is heard panting and mumbling, looking around in a confused state, but not panicked. Someone asks what he’s “on” and Caffey appears to say “weed.”

When the officers pull Caffey up to his feet to take him outside, he says, “I can’t breathe” and struggles to balance. Because Caffey either can’t or won’t use his feet to walk, the cops then lift them up to carry him.

Caffey then attempts to struggle free and the officers place him back on the ground outside. “Quit grabbing me!” one yells. Another says, “Quit grabbing my partner.” Caffey at one point yells, “Let me go!”

The police attempt to further restrain Caffey with more cuffs while one officer has his knee bearing down on Caffey’s left shoulder.

Caffey continues to occasionally cry out in his manic state. One officer says, “He’s definitely on sherm,” a slang term for a joint that’s been coated in PCP, which is known to cause delirium and aggressive behavior.

When paramedics arrive, one cop says, “We’ve got a female that was choked that’s inside, and then there’s a young black male that he was in there talking to his mom when we were getting him (Caffey) out, that he said he was elbowed in the face. This is the suspect.” One medic asks if Caffey has any injuries and the cop tells him only there’s “a scratch on the face.” Caffey is heard throughout the exchange continuing to yell and grunt on the ground.

Caffey was eventually hoisted up to be placed in the squad car, his legs limp. It looks like he may have fallen asleep before coming to when he’s seated. At about 10:20 p.m., nearly an hour after the affair began, an officer checks on Caffey in the car, about three minutes after he was placed there.

Caffey appears unconscious and a medic attempts to awaken him. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he was ultimately pronounced dead after being transferred to a hospital.

Arkansas state law keeps autopsies confidential, but the district attorney, Larry Jegley, said that the medical examiner determined that Caffey’s death was basically due to a freak medical episode called sickle-cell trait which, under extreme physical stress, can result in sudden death.

In short, black men can sometimes have sickled cells, and be completely fine, until one day, under unique circumstances, they’re not.

Did Caffey deserve to die? No. Did the police mistreat another “unarmed black man”? Also no. But is this another one of Ben Crump’s shyster cases with perhaps his most unsympathetic dead client yet? Absolutely.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/20/ben-crump-picks-another-winner-a-black-man-who-died-after-attacking-a-black-man-and-choking-a-woman/,2022-10-20
Can You Imagine A U.S. Without A Constitution? Read This Novel,"We live in an age that rejects incrementalism — the slow improvement of society through small but steady reforms. Instead, groups ranging from Black Lives Matter to dispirited conservatives now contemplate a “national divorce.” We hear of the need for drastic measures — revolution, societal upheaval, Build Back Better, or whatever you want to call it. Don’t pray for patience; make revolutionary plans.

But history is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.

A new historical fiction book, “Crisis of the House Never United: A Novel of Early America,” by Chuck DeVore gets that — and demonstrates not only why procedure and patience matter, but also the genius of the U.S. Constitution (notable in its absence from DeVore’s alternate timeline).

“While relatively much has been written about the challenges faced by the colonists and the struggles of the War for Independence, little has been said about that dim time in the American experience between 1783 and 1789 — after victory over the British and before the ratification of the Constitution,” DeVore, a senior contributor at The Federalist, writes in his introduction. “Yet, this was the time of maximum danger, of intrigue, and of heated passions when men were not yet sure as to whether ballots or bullets would decide the fates of governments.”

The book begins in the American Revolution, with a young soldier, Jeph Clark, receiving his first battlefield wound and his introduction to the major figures of the era: George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr.

A Time of Heated Passions

In the years following the revolution, the Articles of Confederation proved clearly inadequate for governing the new country. Shays’ Rebellion demonstrated this. The Articles lacked the Constitution’s checks and balances, division of powers, and its process for amending the document.

What not enough Americans realize is that ratification of the Constitution was far from a sure thing.

“It almost failed [during the drafting] in Philadelphia, and it almost failed when it was sent out for approval,” DeVore notes. “The Constitution needed to be ratified by nine of the 13 states to go into effect.”

The first five states ratified it fairly quickly. But then things got dicey. Massachusetts narrowly voted in favor of the new Constitution, 187 to 168. And it only passed because Sam Adams and John Hancock extracted a promise from its advocates to add a Bill of Rights as soon as possible. Other states also passed it — narrowly.

But what if the Constitution had failed to win ratification? That’s the alternative timeline DeVore explores. He points out that John Jay, writing as Publius in Federalist No. 5, warned that without a viable Constitution, the new nation could be doomed to division — a North and a South, each seeking independence and likely to turn to European nations for protection against the other. Hamilton, in another Federalist paper, wrote that it could be three new, smaller, and weaker nations.

In DeVore’s novel, ratification fails — and Burr (a satisfyingly well-developed character, much more rounded than Burr in the play “Hamilton”) sees his opportunity. Before long, the divided nation falls apart, as separatists (quite logically) quote the Declaration of Independence to justify dissolving the union.

DeVore (full disclosure: I work with him at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and I read “Crisis of the House” in galleys) is a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer, a former California assemblyman, and a dedicated history buff. His research is comprehensive. And he’s mastered the trick of historical fiction: You have to tell smaller stories to tell the bigger stories. As seismic shifts take place in the once-United States, and as Burr emerges as a despot, we see the changes reflected in the lives of DeVore’s protagonists.

The Hard Work of Incrementalism

How did America avoid this dystopia in reality? Through the hard work of incrementalism, paying attention to procedure, and having patience. Ratification of the Constitution came one vote at a time, one state constitutional convention at a time, one compromise at a time.

These virtues are in short supply today. The New York Times ran an op-ed in 2020 explicitly rejecting them: “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police.”

“Enough,” Mariame Kaba wrote. “We can’t reform the police. … I’ve been advocating the abolition of the police for years. Regardless of your view on police power — whether you want to get rid of the police or simply to make them less violent — here’s an immediate demand we can all make: Cut the number of police in half and cut their budget in half. Fewer police officers equals fewer opportunities for them to brutalize and kill people.”

The 2020 and 2022 elections showed that politicians wised up quickly to the unpopularity of “defund the police.” Progressives, on the other hand, haven’t engaged in even that much introspection.

It’s not just progressives rejecting incrementalism; many conservatives still call for an Article V Convention of the States to bypass Congress on issues such as term limits and the budget.

And the American public in general would prefer a national popular vote for picking the president. Not because the Electoral College is flawed, but simply because it’s complicated. In DeVore’s book, Burr ascends to the presidency via a popular vote (through manipulating the huge New York turnout through the Tammany Hall political machine).

But history shows that incrementalism works — slow and steady wins the race.

High Murder Rates Aren't Deterring Seattle From Defunding Police,"When the Seattle City Council defunded and demonized the police, homicides hit a 26-year high, a mass exodus all but crippled the department, and the voters, somewhat surprisingly, responded by electing a pro-police mayor and council member and a Republican city attorney.

By all measures, the defund movement was an epic and ultimately deadly failure. And yet the council just voted to defund the police again. They just won’t admit it, following the transparent national Democrat strategy of pretending they were never pushing to defund the police.

This newest move is part of a more sinister attempt to dismantle the police department while jettisoning the “defund” label.

By a 6-3 vote, the council passed its 2023 budget, which includes full funding for the Seattle Police Department’s hiring plan. But it also permanently defunds 80 police positions in a department that is already dangerously understaffed. Through a budgetary sleight of hand, left-wing council members are now claiming to have fully funded the police.

Mayor Bruce Harrell initially offered a temporary cut in police funding since it’s clear the department won’t come anywhere close to the hiring spree needed to reach its goals of hiring 200 officers next year.

Instead, his budget supported hiring 120 officers, which would still, admittedly, take herculean strength to accomplish. It was a short-term way to save some cash without compromising future budgets should the SPD finally make progress in hiring new officers.

But the council had other plans. Led by far-left budget chair Teresa Mosqueda, who once defended a man threatening to murder police, council members supportive of defund efforts saw an opening to shrink the department. While fully funding the 2023 staffing plan of 120 officers, they cut the remaining positions for good. In other words, they shrunk the department.

Man shouts to @SeattlePD ""Take your guns, put them onto your chins and pull the trigger. I need you to kill yourselves,"" while Seattle CM @CMTMosqueda says ""the anger is justified"" & King County CM @GirmayZahilay says ""I've seen nothing but peaceful people out here."" (LANGUAGE) pic.twitter.com/96yJl8KcgQ — Jason Rantz on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) June 7, 2020

While most Seattleites — and journalists — don’t closely follow or understand the convoluted budget process, this permanent staffing cut earned the spotlight courtesy of council members Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen. They voted against the budget, specifically citing their concerns over public safety.

“I believe that eliminating these positions does reinforce a ‘defund’ narrative that got us here,” Nelson noted during the debate.

Council member Lisa Herbold responded, accusing Nelson of spreading misinformation and audaciously claiming it was Nelson’s support of police funding that is leading to staffing problems.

“This misinformation results in members of the public not understanding that the council has fully funded the SPD’s hiring budget, for now, the third year in a row,” Herbold said. “And I feel like this conversation that we’re having actually hurts retention, and it hurts hiring because we’re not focusing on what’s in the budget that supports public safety. Instead, we’re talking about the very small reductions in the mayor’s proposed budget.”

But those “very small reductions” send the message to future would-be recruits that the council isn’t done with their politically-motivated police reforms. The council could have made the cuts temporary, but they chose permanence.

The president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild (SPOG), the union representing officers, noted in an interview that Herbold is spinning. Nelson and Pedersen aren’t the problem; the council members who seek to defund the police are hurting retention.

“The big picture is quite clear that we can’t recruit enough people to be cops in this city, mostly because of the political climate we still find ourselves in,” Solan explained on the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH. “And as I look at this in a broad perspective, in terms of the budget, I’m seeing more activist moves to take the money away from police and put it to projects that fulfill an activist talking point. For me, we need cops, and we need people that want to be cops. And we need to be given the confidence to go forth and conduct policing to hold criminals accountable. Because we’re seeing the decay of the city.”

It’s not just union interests calling out Herbold’s spin. Even the notoriously left-wing Seattle Times urged voters to “take note” of the decision by the council.

“To be clear: Herbold and the council majority permanently eliminated open police positions and reduced the size of the department. It is true the budget funds officer positions SPD expects to hire next year. But that is the bare minimum, and little comfort to residents and business owners who want to see marked future improvement,” the editorial noted.

Before the defund movement, city leaders considered 1,500-1,600 officers necessary for a fully functioning department. But after the death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter rallies and riots, nearly 500 officers separated from the department. Mayor Harrell then revised staffing goals to just 1,450.

Officers resented the commitment to cut 50 percent of the budget, even though the council managed less than 20 percent, and they were sick of being demonized by a council that considered them racist murderers. At one point, Herbold endorsed a plan to fire white police officers because of their skin color. It would allow the department to be more diverse while fulfilling a promise to defund and shrink the force.

The city’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate, which resulted in approximately 100 terminations, didn’t help staffing, either.

The department now employs fewer than 900 deployable officers, leaving each precinct and every shift unable to meet staffing minimums. The Command Staff routinely ask officers to leave their specialty units to respond to 911 calls. It’s even led to rape cases being put on the back burner so that detectives can fill the gaps in patrol.

Meanwhile, crime continues to surge.

In 2020, when the council cut the Seattle Police Department budget by 18 percent, the city had 52 homicides, the highest in 26 years. This year the city hit 54, with three weeks still to go. More cops could help mitigate the threats and even thwart the crime surge.

But, at best, the city will get the barest of bare minimum staffing thanks to a council that hopes the public won’t notice it continues to dismantle the police department.

Corporate Journalists Need To Stop Covering For Tyrants Abroad,"The New York Times broke the news last Sunday morning that the Iranian government abolished its notorious morality police, government agents who enforce a strict dress code based on the state’s interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. They have become a universally condemned symbol of oppression after 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died on Sept. 16 in Tehran after the “morality police” arrested and beat her for not wearing her hijab “properly.” Amini’s death sparked nationwide protests that continue today.

The Times celebrated Iran’s abolishment of the morality police as an “apparent victory for feminists.” Other corporate media, from The Wall Street Journal to CNBC, quickly repeated the Times’ story. Margaret Brennan, host of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” began her interview with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken by saying, “I want to start with some breaking news overnight out of Iran, they have abolished the morality police.”

Yet within minutes of the Times’ reporting, human rights activists in Iran and the West denounced the Times story as false. U.S.-based Iranian activist Masih Alinejad tweeted, “It’s disinformation that the Islamic Republic of Iran has abolished it’s [sic] morality police. It’s a tactic to stop the uprising.” Another Iranian activist, Amin Pouria, tweeted, “To lift world’s public opinion pressure, the IR changes [the] name of the ‘Morality Police.’ However, Iranian women & girls are still beaten, imprisoned or killed like #MahsaAmini for mandatory dress code. Don’t let the IR fool you with lies and be Iranian’s voice.”

Even Iran’s government and state media have denied suspending the morality police. Iranian lawmaker and cleric Hossein Jalali reportedly said the morality police are here to stay, and “the Islamic Republic’s crackdown on women not wearing proper hijab will continue with a range of measures that may include blocking their bank accounts.” Kasra Aarabi, an analyst of the U.K.’s Tony Blair Institute, called the Times’ story “fake news.” He pointed out in his tweet, “This disinfo was propagated today to distract media attention from the 3 days of major protests in #Iran which begin tomo. Why did mainstream media ignore this context?”

It turned out the Times’ report was based on a vague comment by Iran’s Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri. When asked by reporters why people hadn’t seen many “morality police” on the streets, Montazeri replied, “The morality police had nothing to do with the judiciary, and the same institution that established it has now shut it down.” The Times ran its story based on this comment while ignoring what Montazeri said: “the judiciary will continue to supervise social behaviors.” After the pushback from Iranian human rights activists, some media began questioning or adding context to the story. Still, the Times has issued no correction or apology to its original report.

How did Western corporate media such as the Times get the morality police story wrong? Corporate media today are less about reporting straight news than advocating narratives, and people who work at these outlets see themselves as activists more than traditional journalists. They search for and only report news that supports their preferred narratives. The fake story of the morality police’s abolishment fits neatly with the narrative that courageous feminists forced an authoritarian regime to make a compromise. It was such a perfect story that the Times’ reporters ran with it rather than spending time to verify and confirm it with more reliable sources.

I see a similar pattern in how Beijing’s latest moves to lift some Covid restrictions after week-long national protests were reported. One analyst of Human Rights Watch tweeted, “The Chinese government is now easing Covid restrictions, thanks to the protesters who courageously took to the street.” While it is true that Chinese protesters were courageous, and Beijing did announce some relief from its Covid restrictions this week, it is delusional to interpret Beijing’s action as a comprise to the protesters.

The Wall Street Journal reported that some Chinese officials were quietly seeking ways to ease the “zero Covid” restrictions to rescue China’s falling economy months before the nationwide protests. According to the WSJ, “Chinese exports fell at the steepest pace in more than two years in November, the latest indication of how the country’s pandemic restrictions and waning global demand for goods are throttling China’s economy.” Besides the economic toll, Beijing is concerned that the continuation of strict Covid controls would “threaten China’s key position in global supply chains” and “lead to a broader decoupling between China and the world.” While Xi publicly vowed to stick to his “zero Covid” policy, he permitted the lifting of some Covid restrictions because even he was keenly aware that economic instability would lead to social unrest. The economic reality, not the nationwide protests, drove Beijing’s latest announcement.

While there is easing, some loathed Covid restrictions remain in place. For example, in some cities, when even one person in an apartment building tested positive, local Covid police sealed the entrance and exit to the entire building and confined all residents in their tiny apartments, forcing them to survive on limited and often overpriced food delivery. The continuation of these inhuman restrictions should surprise no one because Beijing’s “zero Covid” policy was never about health care but controlling people.

Besides chasing narratives, the lack of understanding of the true nature of authoritarian regimes is another explanation for why corporate media outlets often fall for authoritarian disinformation and inadvertently become useful idiots for these regimes.

It is common for democracies to respond to people’s will and make necessary policy changes. But authoritarian regimes do not budge, and their response to civil disobedience is more violent oppression. Since nationwide protests erupted in Iran, more than 18,000 protesters have reportedly been arrested, and the death toll of protesters surpassed 470. This week, Aarabi tweeted that the Iranian government executed another young protester and announced more future executions. Canadian human rights activist and lawyer Kaveh Shahrooz said in an interview, “Iran’s regime is not normal; its official statements are often lies designed to mislead the world. Our media should not take them at their word and must exercise extra caution when reporting on Iran.”

The CCP is not normal, either. It didn’t send tanks to flatten protesters last week only because the regime has found a better way to crack down on dissent without the “unpleasant” visuals of protesters dying in broad daylight. In recent years, Beijing has perfected its surveillance tools in Xinjiang against the Uyghurs. By persecuting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists under a dubious national security law, the Chinese authorities have not only silenced the city’s political dissent but also established the illusion that the CCP practices “rule by law.”

Beijing has already deployed these tactics to identify and intimidate protesters. Additionally, Covid-tracking QR codes that every Chinese citizen was forced to download on their phones to “track not only their COVID-19 risk status, but also their minute-by-minute movements — where they go, how they travel, and the people they encounter — data that is available to police.” Even if not all of these protesters end up in jail, the omnipresent social credit system will ensure they live a miserable life, unable to travel, find employment, open a bank account, or even own a pet.

If the corporate media truly care about maintaining their credibility and striving to support people who live in authoritarian regimes who yearn for freedom and democracy, they need to develop an understanding of these authoritarian regimes and understand that tyrants do not compromise. Corporate journalists must stop passing on these regimes’ disinformation, no matter how well it fits their preferred narratives. They must also find the decency to apologize and retract reporting when proven wrong.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/12/corporate-journalists-need-to-stop-being-useful-idiots-for-authoritarian-regimes/,2022-12-12
House Republicans Expose Pelosi’s Culpability In Jan. 6 Riot,"Democrat leaders who had condemned crackdowns on the violent Black Lives Matter riots of 2020 were too worried about “optics” to appropriately prepare for the massive protests at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to a lengthy new report about the security failures on that day. GOP lawmakers, who were prevented from collaborating on preparations for the joint session of Congress, found Capitol Police were left untrained to handle mass demonstrations while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was personally involved in security decisions that left the complex vulnerable to unrest.

The more than 140-page report, completed by an independent probe of GOP lawmakers who were barred access to material from Pelosi’s Select Committee on Jan. 6, illustrated a Capitol police force left understaffed, ill-equipped, and unprepared to confront the horde of demonstrators who descended on the congressional campus.

“Democrats and the Jan. 6 Committee used the Capitol Police as a political prop, then did nothing when USCP officers were harassed for telling the truth. They should be ashamed,” Indiana Rep. Jim Banks told The Federalist. Banks led the GOP investigation after Speaker Pelosi barred him from his appointment as ranking member of the select committee.

House Republicans documented how Pelosi’s office closely coordinated with senior security staff before the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, where lawmakers would ceremonially certify the results of the 2020 election. While large-scale political events such as presidential inaugurations and state of the union addresses are designated as “National Special Security Events” by the nation’s top security brass, enhanced measures for public safety were absent on Jan. 6.

Democrats, including Pelosi’s staff, were reportedly concerned about the “optics” of a ramped-up police presence reinforced by National Guard troops to protect the Capitol. According to former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned in the riot’s aftermath, Pelosi’s deputies turned down requests for preemptive deployment of the National Guard six times in the run-up to Jan. 6, 2021.

Just over a month after the riot, Pelosi sought to exonerate herself by telling reporters, “I have no power over the Capitol police.”

“This is false,” Republicans stated, pointing to documents and witness testimony throughout their report showing how “then-House Sergeant of Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff.” House rules dictate that the sergeant at arms reports to the speaker, which has continued after the Jan. 6 riot with the installation of magnetometers outside the lower chamber and the erection of a perimeter fence around the complex at Pelosi’s direction.

Democrats’ reluctance to preemptively deploy the National Guard ahead of mass demonstrations, when even Capitol parking attendants had warned of disturbances, stemmed from Democratic lawmakers’ opposition to police the prior summer. Pelosi and House Democrats had previously condemned the presence of federal troops in the nation’s capital to quell the violent mobs that overran the city in the name of social justice.

Irving, according to the GOP report, routinely met with Democratic staff in the run-up to Jan. 6 without Republicans present.

“The [House sergeant at arms] had a pattern of and practice of seeking and obtaining permission from the Speaker for all security decisions,” Republican investigators wrote. They added that while Pelosi’s approval for National Guard troops on the day of the riot was not technically required — only the police board’s permission was needed — the speaker’s green light “had become required through years of practice.”

“Staff within the House Sergeant at Arms office emailed Paul Irving that January 6th was Pelosi’s fault,” Republicans wrote in a key finding, with identities redacted to protect staff from professional reprisal.

Police Understaffed, Ill-Equipped, and Undertrained

While officers were denied reinforcements from the National Guard until the Capitol was already under siege, the same officers left to defend the complex were practically defenseless. One unnamed officer told Republican investigators he or she was left to defend lawmakers with nothing but a baseball cap after leadership gave 15-year-old gear to new recruits.

A Department of Justice memo included in a June Judicial Watch lawsuit revealed that on Jan. 6, Capitol Police operated with “less than half” of what’s “usually assigned” for the House’s “normal staffing for a joint session.”

According to the GOP report, Capitol Police are still operating on a slim staff, more than 100 officers short of the authorized cap of 2,072.

Citing an agency inspector general report, Republican investigators noted that officers fought to protect the Capitol on Jan. 6 with expired munitions and compromised equipment. For example, “officers witness riot shields shattering on impact.”

“In some cases, equipment was disregarded because [U.S. Capitol Police] officers were not trained to use it,” investigators wrote.

One unnamed officer told Republicans that officers were denied regular trainings on potentially lethal weapons such as the baton.

“Obviously, we do firearms twice a year, but that’s about it for training on our equipment,” the anonymous officer told investigators. “Baton should be, at minimum, once a year. I mean, it’s a piece of equipment where we could actually hurt or kill somebody with, and we’ve never trained on it.”

Some training is now offered online. But Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger told House Republicans that continual staffing shortages limit the agency’s ability to conduct effective, regular, in-person training.

“A shortage of officers, a lack of training, and insufficient equipment does not entirely explain the failures at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,” lawmakers wrote in their report. “But the documents and testimony make clear that more officers who were better equipped and trained could have effected a starkly different outcome.”

The report makes clear that a combination of political motivations within senior Capitol leadership, inadequate preparation, and years of failure to implement past recommendations from the Government Accountability Office led to the security breakdown at the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/21/house-republicans-expose-pelosis-culpability-in-jan-6-riot/,2022-12-21
How Hollywood Uses TV To Lie About Good Guys With Guns,"When an alleged armed robber barged into Ranchito #4 Taqueria on Jan. 4, almost every customer froze with fear. But one good Samaritan, an unnamed 46-year-old man, quickly jumped into action to protect himself and his fellow patrons. He used a concealed gun to shoot the alleged perpetrator and returned the stolen cash to the terrified patrons, only later to discover that the firearm the alleged robber used was a fake.

Despite the customer’s heroic actions, he has received nothing but condemnation from corporate media after the alleged thief was declared dead on the scene. Unfortunately, this media treatment is nothing new. Over the past few years, only a few good Samaritans have received any press despite the overwhelming number of these brave individuals jumping into action.

In December, for example, a man stopped an active shooter at an Amazon warehouse parking lot in the Phoenix, Arizona area. The police called the man a “good Samaritan” and credit him with likely preventing further bloodshed. In another case later that month, an active shooter at a Tucson, Arizona bar threatened many people but was “stopped short by a heroic customer with a gun.”

You may not hear about many of these stories outside of local media accounts, but they occur all the time. There are dozens of cases in recent years in which concealed handgun permitholders stopped what, according to police, would have otherwise become mass public shootings.

These good Samaritans saving the day would make gripping stories, but we don’t see much news on these cases. National entertainment television also fails to reveal the truth about these good Samaritans: For decades, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox have refused to feature even a single successful defensive gun use by a civilian. You would never know Americans successfully use guns defensively on average approximately 2 million times a year, or that they use guns four to five times more frequently to stop crime than to commit it.

Entertainment programs always show defensive gun uses going wrong (the sole exception in the last decade is Paramount’s “Yellowstone”). Typically the citizen fails to defend himself and ends up murdered, accidentally shoots a loved one, or poses a danger to himself and the police. After the Supreme Court decision this past June striking down New York’s restrictions on concealed handguns, television shows have begun to demonize concealed-carry permits.

Here are just a few examples from the 2022-23 television season so far:

ABC’s “The Rookie,” Jan. 3, 2023: Against the adamant advice of a police officer, a legally armed civilian intervenes in a bank robbery. Despite his good intentions, he only succeeds in getting himself and another civilian shot. To make matters worse, the armed civilian’s intervention allows the bank robbers to escape. “Leave it to a good guy with a gun to really screw things up,” remarks the police officer. About 4.5 million viewers saw that episode.

CBS’s “FBI: Most Wanted,” Nov. 22, 2022: After a criminal bashes a person’s head with a rock in Central Park, a good Samaritan chases the criminal. The criminal shoots at the permit holder, who shoots back but misses and ends up severely wounding a female bystander. The FBI agent characterizes the permit holder as a “vigilante.” When the permit holder tells an FBI agent the police need to do their job, the agent grabs the permit holder and exclaims: “We are, but it only gets harder with idiots like you playing cops and robbers!” More than 5.1 million people watched this episode.

NBC’s “Law & Order,” Nov. 6, 2022: In this episode, a woman pulls her permitted concealed handgun out and mistakenly threatens to shoot two people who were police officers. The police almost end up shooting her in self-defense, proceeding to arrest her “for pulling a gun on a cop.” They explain that despite her permit, she doesn’t know the rules for carrying guns and that she is “lucky to be alive.” About 4 million people saw this show.

CBS’s “Blue Bloods,” Oct. 28, 2022: When robbers try to take a woman’s $20,000 watch, she pulls out her permitted concealed handgun to protect herself. As a result, she is severely wounded by the robbers. Others who were robbed of their watches by the same criminals didn’t have guns and weren’t harmed. “Got the gun for protection … so much for that,” says the victim. Almost 5.8 million people viewed this show.

NBC’s “Chicago PD,” Oct. 5, 2022: At first, it appears a civilian has successfully defended himself against a robbery. Later, it becomes clear that the “good Samaritan” was actually the lookout who had turned on his robbery crew. Just shy of 6 million people saw this.

CBS’s “FBI: Most Wanted,” Sept. 20, 2022: This episode has two different examples of defensive gun uses failing. In the first, a family is murdered before the father is able to get off a shot. “So much for a good guy with a gun,” an FBI agent remarks dismissively. About 5.3 million people saw this episode.

Many other episodes display failed defensive gun uses, and these are just the ones involving people legally carrying outside their homes. None of this should be too surprising, as it is well-known that gun control groups are working with Hollywood writers and producers to introduce gun control themes into shows.

My organization, the Crime Prevention Research Center, has found a total of 360 active-shooter incidents from 2014 to 2021. Of these, an armed citizen stopped 124 (more than one-third). We are more confident of the completeness of our data in the most recent years, and 49 percent of active shooting cases in 2021 were stopped by armed civilians. When we exclude shootings in gun-free zones, the figure rises to 58 percent.

In not one of these 124 defensive gun uses did a permit holder accidentally shoot a bystander. Not once did a permit holder get in the way of the police. But anyone who watches entertainment television would have no clue that this is the case.

People can’t escape the political bias in television entertainment. The message from these shows is clear: Don’t use guns for protection. If you do, it will cause much more harm than benefit. It is bad enough that news programs provide just one side of this debate. But the bias has a real effect on the gun control debate and prevents Americans from doing what keeps them safe.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/19/how-hollywood-uses-tv-shows-to-lie-about-good-guys-with-guns/,2023-01-19
"After Feds Ignore Attacks, Pro-Lifers Take Up Private Investigations","Last June, a firebomb ripped through the CompassCare crisis pregnancy center in Buffalo, causing extensive damage but no deaths. Amid the rubble and soot, the words “Jane was here” were written on the wall, suggesting that the militant abortion rights group Jane’s Revenge was responsible. Almost immediately, authorities all the way up to the FBI assured the pro-life enterprise they would bring the perpetrators to justice.

Eight months later, CompassCare officials say nothing has happened. Nor have any arrests been made in any of the scores of similar attacks that have damaged other crisis pregnancy counseling offices and churches coast to coast since word first leaked in late May that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, returning abortion laws to state legislatures.

CompassCare CEO Jim Harden says this inaction has forced the pro-life movement to do the work of law enforcement on its own. His organization has teamed with the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit libertarian law firm in Chicago, to hire their own private investigators. The home of the firm’s president, Thomas Brejcha, was damaged by abortion supporters last July.

Neither the Thomas More Society nor CompassCare elaborated on the private investigators hired to look at the attacks by abortion supporters — who they are, how many, or where deployed. But Brejcha said no price limit has been put on their services.

The development comes at a time when many, especially on the right, are warning of the politicization of justice. A few of the examples they point to are the SWAT team arrest of Trump adviser Roger Stone; the armed search of former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in pursuit of classified documents (along with the multiple lawsuits specifically aimed at Trump); and Attorney General Merrick Garland’s ordering the FBI to track possible threats of violence or intimidation after parents began confronting school boards about what their children were being taught in public schools.

They say such heavy-handedness contrasts with law enforcement at the local, state, and federal levels turning a blind eye to obvious lawlessness not identified with the right. Examples include the nationwide George Floyd riots of 2020; smash-and-grab thefts at retail stores from New York to Los Angeles; homeless camps turned open-air drug bazaars; and city prosecutors declining to enforce laws because of concerns regarding “systemic racism.”

“I think the country’s gone bonkers,” Brejcha said. “We watched rioters looting in the south side of Chicago, where I grew up. I think what we’re doing is a normal response. It’s not vigilante, but citizens taking civic action.”

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told RealClearInvestigations: “I’m not surprised pro-life groups have had to conduct their own investigations after being attacked by radical abortion activists. Sadly, they’ve been left with no other option because of the blatant politicization of the Biden FBI and the Justice Department.”

Abortion opponents are doubly incensed by what they consider aggressive action by the Department of Justice against them. They, along with several Republican members of Congress, accuse the department of one-sided enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, a 1994 law that prohibits “violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services.”

The Justice Department pursued dozens of anti-abortion activists in multiple states on FACE Act charges last year, chiefly for alleged offenses in previous years, according to its website. In October, federal prosecutors indicted 11 people in Tennessee, including an 87-year-old survivor of a Communist concentration camp, for alleged actions stemming from a 2021 incident. Another incident outside a Washington, D.C. abortion facility in 2020 led to 10 more indictments in March and October of 2022.

Abortion opponents note that, in contrast, federal officials have failed to make a single arrest in what the Thomas More Society counts as 161 attacks on pro-lifers since the leak of the Supreme Court draft decision last May. In addition to the CompassCare attack in Buffalo, these include actions against pregnancy crisis centers in Washington, D.C., and Oregon, as well as Brejcha’s home in Evanston, Illinois (unoccupied at the time). Federal prosecutors have made a cause célèbre out of Mark Houck, a longtime anti-abortion activist and father of seven who was arrested in an FBI raid on his Pennsylvania home last September and now faces a Jan. 24 court date for alleged FACE violations.

Houck’s case stems from an incident outside a Philadelphia abortion facility in October 2021. Houck and an abortion supporter tangled outside the clinic, with Houck claiming he was defending his son. Local police were called to the scene and declined action; a court complaint against Houck was dismissed when no one appeared to press the case.

Nevertheless, months later the Justice Department took up the case. He was arrested at his Pennsylvania home by armed state and federal agents last September and charged with two FACE Act violations involving the alleged shoving incidents. He faces up to 11 years in prison. Thomas More Society lawyers are defending Houck, and they filed motions last month to dismiss the case, calling the FACE Act unconstitutional and accusing the Biden administration of “viewpoint discrimination” and “selective prosecution.”

The FBI insists its agents have remained impartial.

But anti-abortion activists say the bureau’s claims are undermined by their own admissions. FBI Director Christopher Wray acknowledged in congressional testimony last November “that, since the Dobbs Act decision, probably in the neighborhood of 70 percent of our abortion-related violence cases or threats cases are cases of violence or threats against pro-life, the victims are pro-life organizations.”

Asked repeatedly whether any arrest had been made in these cases, the FBI declined to comment. On Jan. 19, the day after RCI’s most recent request for arrest data, the bureau reissued its November announcement of rewards up to $25,000 for information that leads to an arrest in nine more attacks against abortion opponents in addition to the Buffalo firebombing.

“The FBI is continuing to investigate a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the U.S. Supreme Court,” a spokesman said. “The incidents are being investigated as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, FACE Act violations, or violent crime matters, depending on the facts of each case.”

Harden of CompassCare called the rewards a publicity stunt that reflects “feigned interest” by the Justice Department and said perhaps the investigators hired by CompassCare and the Thomas More Society could get their own investigatory work “underwritten by the reward money.”

Harden said the reward money “makes FBI Director Wray look like the hero absent results,” Harden said. “It’s a day late and a dollar short.”

The FBI took CompassCare’s security video from the night of the attack and has refused to return it, and Harden said when he called last June to get an idea of any progress in the investigation, agents told him: “We don’t answer to you. We’re not answering any of your questions.”

It was only last August, after Sen. Cruz criticized the Justice Department for politicizing its activity and accused it of neglecting the attacks on anti-abortion figures, that the FBI called and requested a meeting. There, the FBI tried to buy his silence, according to Harden.

“They said, ‘If you back off we’ll give this more attention,’” he recalled. “Now they know they’ll be under scrutiny from the House Judiciary Committee,” — a reference to the Republican takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives this year.

Like Harden, Brejcha said he has not seen any progress into the investigation of the vandalism of his house last July, despite a seemingly large number of leads. The demonstration at his house was advertised on social media and printed on flyers. Protesters drove to a nearby park before marching to Brejcha’s house where the black-clad and masked activists tore out bushes, spray-painted the house, and tossed smoke bombs and paint bombs at it. No one was injured in the incident.

Brejcha said videotape showed the protesters gathering in the park, and car license plates of protesters are available to investigators. But in the face of such evidence, he says, he does not believe a good-faith effort has been made by police. A spokesman for the Evanston, Ill., police department confirmed to RCI last week there have been no arrests.

“The police told me they’d been tipped by the FBI that they would be targeting my house the next day,” Brejcha said. “That’s a threat.”

Brejcha said he did “not want to attack the police, but they need to be more aggressive. There are so many connections between all these events.”

Hans von Spakovsky, a conservative attorney, told RCI he wasn’t surprised that abortion opponents felt compelled to hire their own investigative staff given the lack of attention they’ve received as victims.

“It is another shocking development that victims of violent attacks and harassment can’t trust the FBI to actually investigate their case or the Justice Department to prosecute it,” he said. “It is even more evidence of the politicization of federal law enforcement, one of the most dangerous developments in modern times.”

Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan sent a letter to Garland just before the November midterms demanding the preservation of documents and promising that “one-sided enforcement of the FACE act” would be among politicized moves his House Judiciary Committee would investigate.

Outside of the abortion battles, some of those who feel similarly betrayed by authorities wish they, too, could hire their own police. In Phoenix, for instance, people have fought with city officials for months over “The Zone,” a growing homeless encampment where a charred fetus was found last November and a burned man in December.

“I’d love to get private security here but who can afford it?” said Angela Ojile, who owns an antique store across the street from “The Zone” and its estimated 1,000 people. “I know the police have been told to stand down, and now they’ve created a dangerous situation.”

Ojile described a nightmarish situation in which drug dealing, public defecation, and a threatening atmosphere overwhelm her, anyone she can convince to work in the store, and potential customers.

“There’s some scary people down there and I can’t keep employees,” she said. “They’re so petrified because people are getting beat up, held up, there’s people running around half naked over there.”

“The Zone,” like the abortion battles, has spawned litigation. On one hand, the Goldwater Institute, a conservative Arizona-based think tank, has thrown its support behind a lawsuit that accuses Phoenix authorities of betraying the public trust. A spate of violent crimes including shootings, stabbings, and rape have made “The Zone” a perverse example of compassion run amok.

“It’s just lawless,” the Institute’s Austin Vanderheyden told RCI. “The city in its inaction has caused this.”

Phoenix has launched some small-scale clean-up operations but those have come under legal attack by the ACLU, which sued the city in part to block the removal of temporary shelters in “The Zone.”

At both the federal and local level in these cases, the argument is the same: that officials have made law enforcement decisions based on politics.

“It’s a hard word to talk about the ‘politicization’ of the Justice Department, but there seems to be too much tolerance on one side of the political equation,” Brejcha said.

Harden said the decisions within the Justice Department that appear to green-light aggressive prosecution of abortion opponents while overlooking attacks by abortion supporters leave groups and individuals with no choice but to move outside traditional law enforcement channels.

“This signals to me a breach of contract between the government and the people,” he said. “Civilized order depends on people’s trust that criminals will at least be pursued in good faith. But when they refuse to investigate crimes equally, their corruption becomes complete and they become complicit in the crimes themselves.”

Addendum: After requests to the FBI for comment before RCI’s publication deadline, the bureau responded post-publication:

The FBI takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and reports them to the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. Contrary to the inference, the FBI has continued to rigorously investigate the arson of the CompassCare facility and will continue to do so. On January 19, the FBI began offering up to a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the persons responsible for the arson.

New Video Of Paul Pelosi Attack Raises So Many Questions,"Video footage and the 911 call related to the highly weird Paul Pelosi beating from October were released Friday, so the whole thing is a little less mysterious in that we now know the former House speaker’s husband’s attacker really did break into the Pelosi home using a hammer on a glass door and Paul really did try calling the cops for help.

But now there are new questions about what exactly happened between the time the assailant, David DePape, broke into the home and the moment police got to the scene. The corporate media, which take it upon themselves to defend all things Nancy Pelosi, will no doubt call the questions “conspiracy theories” and “disinformation,” but now that I’ve endured seeing 82-year-old Paul in his underwear, hopefully they’ll humor me.

The police body cam footage is disturbing, but just as weird is Paul’s 911 call. As calmly as can be, he tells the San Francisco police operator that “there’s a gentleman here waiting for my wife to come back” and that “I guess we’ll have to wait” because Nancy was in Washington, D.C., and wouldn’t be home for a number of days. Asked if he needs emergency assistance, Paul says, “I don’t think so” but asks if the Capitol Police are “around.” The operator tells him that he called the San Francisco police, to which Paul says, “I understand.” Then, apparently talking to DePape, Paul says, “I don’t know, what do you think?”

DePape seems to respond, but it’s unintelligible. “He thinks everything’s good, but I’ve got a problem, but he thinks everything’s good,” Paul tells the operator. He also says DePape “just came into the house,” that he doesn’t know who DePape is, and, “Anyway, he’s telling me to put the phone down.” The operator asks for DePape’s name and, apparently being able to hear the operator, he responds, “David DePape. My name’s David.”

Was the call on speakerphone? The criminal complaint against DePape said Paul was asleep in his bedroom when DePape encountered him. At some point, Paul was able to go to a bathroom to make the 911 call. But DePape is clearly heard near Paul on the phone. Did he go with him to the bathroom? Did he not care that Paul was calling the cops? That’s strange, since DePape told police after his arrest that he was there to physically harm Nancy. Wouldn’t the involvement of police complicate that effort?

I know the only acceptable opinion to voice about this in the eyes of the corrupt media is that DePape is a depraved, mentally unwell individual and that this is the logical consequence of Donald Trump having stirred up violent white nationalists, but I must say… I listened to the audio recording of DePape’s interview with police after his arrest, and while he was a little overzealous in his conduct and ambitions, his account of political affairs and events of the not-distant past is not only not insane, it’s actually pretty accurate. He told the cops that Democrats and Washington bureaucrats lied in criminal ways to take down Trump (true) and that it “starts” with Hillary Clinton (true).

All of that is to say even if DePape has mental deficits, he was not incoherent or confused.

The call to police happened at 2:23 a.m., according to the criminal complaint. Less than 10 minutes later, two officers were at the Pelosi residence and knocking on the door. It’s unclear who opens it from inside, but there stand Paul and DePape, each holding the same hammer, but not in any apparent struggle. There also appears to be a beverage can in Paul’s left hand. (He gets thirsty in these situations.)

“Hey guys,” Paul says to the police.

“How you doing?” an officer responds.

“How are ya?” Pelosi says.

“What’s going on, man?” an officer says.

DePape replies, “Everything’s good.”

Paul again says, “Hi.”

It’s a surreal scene, which is perhaps why only then did a cop order that the hammer be let go, to which DePape says, “Uh, nope!” He and Paul begin to struggle over it, before DePape tugs it away and then charges, bludgeoning Paul, though most of it isn’t directly visible in the footage.

Where were the two men before answering the door? What were they doing? It doesn’t look like they were fighting before the cops arrived, given the calm greeting Paul offered. So how did the two end up holding the hammer together? Why did DePape decide to become aggressive only after police had come to the house?

The ramifications of a prominent Democrat’s spouse being assaulted are pretty limited. But that from the beginning this has been so weird, and that the corporate media continue trying to cut the mic of anyone who notices, makes it still very mysterious.

"Without Black Lives Matter, Tyre Nichols Might Not Have Died","Two of the five police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols were hired by the Memphis Police Department after it relaxed its hiring requirements, a new report by The New York Post shows.

Tadarrius Bean and Demetrius Haley both joined the MPD in August 2020 after education qualifications to become an officer were dramatically lowered two years prior. The department nixed the required associate’s degree or 54 college credit hours for recruits in 2018 due to a lack of applicants.

“They’re desperate. They want police officers,” retired NYPD detective Mike Alcazar told the Post. “They’re going through it, they check off some boxes, saying, ‘Ok, they’re good enough, get them on.”

In fact, the department was so desperate for recruits it offered $15,000 signing bonuses in both 2021 and 2022, and waivers for applicants who had been convicted of felonies. Even this did not prevent the force from being down 500 officers in January 2022.

Back in September 2020, a month after Bean and Haley were hired, former Deputy Director of MPD Mike Ryall told the Memphis Commercial Appeal that the rise of violent crime in the city could be attributed to the police department’s understaffing and lack of manpower.

Bean and Haley were also hired during the summer of the George Floyd riots, a global protest movement organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. The protests spread to more than 2,000 cities across America, causing more than $1 billion in property damage and killing at least 25 people. Such a movement, whose main mantra was “defund the police,” significantly damaged police morale.

According to a June 2021 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), the rate of retirement at police departments rose 45% in 2020 compared to the previous year, with a 20% increase in resignations. The hiring rate also dropped by 5%.

Simply put: police officers were quitting at unprecedented rates across the country to escape such a hostile environment, and departments were struggling to meet minimum staffing requirements. This coincided with a massive crime wave across America’s major cities.

“So at that very moment you’re hoping you can put police out there to try to deal with crime, you’re seeing the workforce shrinking with an unprecedented number of retirements and resignations,” PERF’s Executive Director Chuck Wexler told NPR.

While a shortage of recruits is no excuse for relaxing hiring standards for cops, it is a product of disastrous dynamics the Black Lives Matter movement and leftist elites have cultivated. There is a lot of power and money in stoking fears of racism and hatred. And it is all done at the cost of the safety of the American public, most especially black Americans like Nichols.

For sure, let the cops implicated in Nichols’ death be charged to the fullest extent of the law, but it is important to remember why officers of that quality were hired to those positions in the first place.

Are We Allowed To Consider Cops' Side Of The Tyre Nichols Story?,"If Ben Crump, America’s No. 1 attorney in illiteracy, gets what he wants, kiss the right to due process — or what’s left of it — goodbye. If you’re suspected of committing a crime, particularly if you’re a police officer in the line of duty, pray you don’t see his face. It will be all but a death sentence.

Crump last week said that the Memphis Police Department’s response to the death of 29-year-old black man Tyre Nichols is “the blueprint for going forward” in matters of police confronting black suspects. By that, he apparently means firing, arresting, and prosecuting cops based on whatever half-baked narrative Crump puts out with hopes of getting a multimillion-dollar settlement with the city — all before law enforcement has had a chance to release any materials in its own defense.

Here’s what allegedly happened in the run-in between Nichols and the police: He was stopped by multiple cop cars on Jan. 7 for, police said, reckless driving; he was pulled from his car, but while officers attempted to subdue him, he broke free and fled the scene; after police were able to apprehend Nichols a second time, he allegedly continued to struggle and multiple cops appear to have taken turns beating him. Those details are apparent in the videos released by authorities on Friday.

But while Crump wants cable news opinions on incomplete footage of a confrontation with police to be the “blueprint” for firing and convicting cops, it might be helpful — fair, even — to get a little more information beforehand.

Why did police feel the need to forcibly remove Nichols from his car? Why did he resist the detention? What does the police incident report say? What does the medical examiner’s report of Nichols’ autopsy say? What does the district attorney’s criminal complaint against the five officers say?

We know none of that information because we have none of the supporting documents or testimony. No incident report, no medical examiner’s report, and no criminal complaint against the police.

To be sure, our stupid media, fully invested in Crump’s cause, dutifully reported that an “independent” autopsy found Nichols to have “suffered extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating.” It further confirmed that “his observed injuries are consistent with what the family and attorneys witnessed on the video of his fatal encounter with police…”

OK, first, there is no such thing as an “independent” autopsy. There is only an official autopsy conducted by the state’s medical examiner. Anything else done to the body outside of that is privately funded by a third party — in this case, apparently Crump and the Nichols family. In other words, they paid for what they got before any official autopsy report was released to the public.

Second, those findings, such as they are, have so far only been relayed by Crump himself, who has not made the private report available to any media that have requested it. Thusly, CNN reported on Jan. 25: “CNN has asked Crump for a copy of the autopsy commissioned by the family, but he said the full report is not yet ready.”

And if we’re just basing our decision to convict off the so-far released video footage, plus the ever-so-helpful repeated statements by the police chief about how “inhumane” the contents of it are, then let’s talk about what’s in that footage.

It starts with an officer in his car, driving to the scene where more police appear to have blocked Nichols’ vehicle on multiple sides. The cop exits his own squad car and approaches Nichols’ vehicle, at which point another officer is opening the door and pulling Nichols out. They demand that Nichols get on the ground on his stomach, though he resists and tells them, “Y’all are doing a lot right now,” and “I’m just trying to go home.”

There is further struggling as Nichols gets back up to his feet and an officer tries shooting him with a Taser. Nichols is able to flee on foot. More officers arrive to assist and chase Nichols down. At some point, they find him and are once again able to force him to the ground.

An officer sprays Nichols with an irritant but appears also to spray himself, something he complains about in separate video footage. Nichols repeatedly struggles to get on his feet, even as separate cops are seen swinging fists at his head and body. As you’ve heard, there’s a lot of commotion, and Nichols calls for “Mom,” who apparently lives fairly close to where the incident occurred.

Once he’s finally been thoroughly detained and intensely beaten, the police talk among themselves. A few important remarks are picked up:

“He high as a kite.”

“That motherf-cker high.”

“He high. He high as a motherf-cker.”

“I sprayed. He sprayed … tased.”

And:

“Swung. Bam, almost hit me.”

“He reached for Martin’s gun.”

“He had his hand on my gun. That motherf-cker…”

“He’s stronger than a motherf-cker.”

What were they talking about? What did they see that we didn’t? What did they feel that we couldn’t?

One officer said he initiated the stop because Nichols was driving against traffic and swerving toward his own squad car as police signaled for Nichols to stop. Eventually, the officer said, Nichols paused at a red light and that’s when the police engaged him on foot. Was Nichols under the influence of a deadly drug when he was confronted by police? It wouldn’t be the first time something like that happened.

In any event, nobody believes Nichols deserved to die or to be excessively beaten by overzealous cops. But what happened? We should know everything, and “everything” isn’t limited to incomplete video and whatever Ben Crump has to say.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/31/are-we-allowed-to-consider-law-enforcements-side-of-the-tyre-nichols-incident/,2023-01-31
"Tyre Nichols' Death Demands Accountability, Not Overhauls","Tyre Nichols was allegedly brutally beaten to death by several Memphis police officers, and it was all caught on tape. As a former prosecutor and state attorney general, I customarily reserve judgment even when incidents are video recorded — as proper investigations to ensure fair play do take time and patience.

In this case, however, I do not think it much of a stretch to say the video makes it clear that the police officers involved will go to jail, the city of Memphis is going to pay out millions of dollars to Nichols’ family, and the Memphis Police Department is going to undergo severe and public scrutiny — reflecting its responsibility in the failed training and supervision of these rogue officers. This is accountability as it should be.

Yet, as has become the usual practice, Congress is now being called upon again to enact federal legislation to reform policing — ostensibly to prevent another Tyre Nichols or George Floyd or Rodney King tragedy from occurring.

Had the officers who appeared to beat Nichols to death been white officers, these calls to Congress would have been accompanied by broad assertions of systemic racism and the disproportionate targeting of black victims. But in this instance, with the primary offending officers all appearing to be black, the usual specter of race as a motivator takes a backseat to what is readily apparent — these are just bad cops.

Thus, a proper question is: What should happen now? Do the circumstances of Nichols’ death require national police reform to prevent a similarly deadly occurrence?

By all accounts, what happened to Nichols was a crime and not a reflection of standard police policy. The now-former police officers face criminal charges, including murder.

Would a national ban on police chokeholds have prevented Nichols’ death? That’s what reformers wanted after Floyd’s death — as if that would have saved him from a bad cop.

Would a prohibition against specialized police units like the now-disbanded Memphis Police Department’s Scorpion unit have prevented Nichols’ death?

Nichols is dead because, by all appearances, at least five members of the Memphis Police Department violated their oath, broke the law, and beat him to death. If there is some actual demonstration that policing in the United States generally condones this type of behavior, then perhaps calls for sweeping reforms might be worthy of review.

But, as evidenced by the fact that the system is currently in the process of holding the officers involved accountable for their apparent crimes, this case does not indicate a need for wholesale reform of the entire policing system. Rather, Nichols’ death demands accountability for gross deviations from proper conduct by corrupt individuals within the criminal justice system.

There is presumably not a police department in the country in which the apparent actions of the officers involved in Nichols’ death would not already be violating the law. As The Washington Post acknowledged, the Memphis Police Department “already has a policy on the books requiring officers to ‘take reasonable action to intervene’ if they observe a colleague ‘engaged in dangerous or criminal conduct or abuse of a subject.'”

Obviously, that law was not followed; to pass more laws that will not be followed by deviant officers will not prevent those officers’ actions any more than gun bans stop criminals who are already willing to break the law. As Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, noted, the policing reforms that Democrats pushed for after the death of Floyd would not have kept Nichols’ death from happening.

No matter what laws are passed, bad cops bent on breaking the law will not consider those laws as they are breaking them.

Memphis and Tennessee officials have thus far acted appropriately by moving swiftly toward transparency and accountability in the aftermath of Nichols’ beating and death. The police officers in question were fired. They have each been charged with causing or facilitating the death of Nichols. Almost certainly, they will go to prison.

There does not appear to be any sugarcoating of responsibility by the department or the city of Memphis for civil liability for causing Nichols’ death — and further and necessary scrutiny will likely produce meaningful changes in the training and supervision of Memphis police officers, as it should.

We should always look for meaningful ways to improve our public safety functions. I recall years ago being a skeptical prosecutor when body cameras were first recommended for wider deployment. I was then of the opinion that a video clip of only a portion of an event might be taken out of context and skew the evidence.

However, I have long since learned to embrace the value of the body camera and the dashboard camera as not only solid evidentiary tools for evaluating the potential criminal behavior of suspects but — just as importantly — as reliable and necessary checks on police conduct and procedures.

The job of a police officer is to protect and serve. It is one of the most dangerous jobs in existence. Police across the nation deserve our utmost respect and gratitude — just as we all deserve that they be held accountable for upholding the same laws they are sworn to enforce.

"Crime Isn't Going Down, Democrat-Run Cities Just Don't Report It","Even while gangs increasingly mug, carjack, and gun people down on the streets of many major cities, fentanyl poisoning deaths take 100,000 American lives, and mass murder incidents happen with unsettling regularity, perceptions of crime are highly influenced by partisanship. Gallup finds that when a Democrat is president, Republicans see crime as more of a problem than do Democrats, with the reverse happening when a Republican is in the White House.

Competing narratives and poor information plague the national discussion over public safety. This makes it difficult to reach a political consensus on what should be done. Even as Gallup’s polling shows the belief that “crime is increasing locally is now at the highest point,” it notes, “In absolute terms, Americans have for decades exhibited a marked tendency to say that crime is increasing rather than decreasing, year in and year out.”

It’s difficult enough that public perception of crime is often untethered from reality, it’s even worse when the government agencies that are supposed to report, gather, and analyze crime are failing at an alarming rate.

The left-leaning criminal justice nonprofit The Marshall Project, in commenting on the FBI’s annual release of crime statistics last November, noted, “The nation’s most thorough crime data collection program concluded it’s possible crime went up, went down or stayed the same.” Why the uncertainty? It “largely stems from the fact that 2021’s data was more incomplete than any in recent memory. … This year about 7,000 police agencies, covering about 35% of the U.S. population were missing.” To address the massive holes in the data from large cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, the Justice Department simply made an estimate.

“In some cases,” Marshall noted, “the FBI didn’t even have enough information to make an estimation.”

Why the huge amount of missing arrest data? Two reasons. First, the FBI finally switched fully over to a new reporting system, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The FBI had been accepting data in a format that was nearly 100 years old, and 2021 was the first year the reports from police departments — entirely voluntary — had to be in the new format. But there’s another disturbing reason some police departments don’t report data: It could make them or the left-wing politicians overseeing them look bad.

As a result, the FBI did not publish any state-level violent crime numbers for California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. Further, the entire West region lacked an estimate of violent crimes, murders, and aggravated assaults. Thus, when some, mostly on the left, argue that crime is going down, it’s a highly suspect claim.

I asked Julie Warren, my colleague at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, who works as the deputy director for the Right on Crime initiative, about persistent non-reporting of crime data by police departments. She said that a non-reporting department, such as the San Francisco Police Department, could be dissuaded from reporting arrests because the district attorney refuses to press charges on most arrestees, resulting in a dismal closure rate for the department — 100 suspects arrested, three charged, one convicted.

Until he was recalled in a July 8, 2022, election, San Francisco’s DA was Soros-backed radical leftist Chesa Boudin. One can easily imagine the San Francisco PD simply throwing in the towel on all but the most egregious crimes in the City by the Bay.

In addition, Soros DAs run several other major prosecutorial offices, with Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, St. Louis, New York, Baltimore, Albuquerque, Orlando, and three urban counties in Northern Virginia suffering increases in crime as DAs quickly allow the accused to walk.

Unsurprisingly, there’s a big overlap between entities that don’t report crime statistics to the FBI and Soros prosecutors — no report, no crime.

Yet, even with the incomplete 2021 FBI crime statistics showing what appears to be little change in crime rates from 2020 — murder up 4 percent, overall violent crime down 1 percent — only half of violent crimes are even reported. In addition to the FBI’s arrest database, since 1973, the Justice Department runs a separate crime victimization survey. This less well-known measure has consistently shown higher rates of violent crime than law enforcement agencies report to the FBI.

I asked Warren about this, and she noted that crime victims who live in high-risk communities where liberal DAs or basic cash bail policies operate have strong incentives not to report crime. Should they report the local gang member who robbed their shop or mugged them, the gang member, if arrested, will quickly make bail — being in a gang means having friends who will bail you out — and who will then come looking to exact revenge. The same goes for domestic violence victims whose abusive boyfriends may come back to beat them, or worse.

One solution to this problem would be to introduce risk assessments in bail. Risk assessments look at two things: the likelihood the defendant will show up for trial and the public safety risk the defendant poses to the community. Unfortunately, the left, as well as the bail bond industry, is almost universally opposed to risk assessments in bail, claiming that they are racially biased. While some risk assessments are essentially a proprietary black box and may contain a racial element in scoring, there are plenty of open-source risk assessments that do not use race or ethnicity.

Before a DA can decide to press charges, and before someone charged with a crime can make bail, they have to be arrested — or, even better, deterred from committing a crime in the first place. Unfortunately, the “Defund the Police” movement has reduced resources available for policing in some cities while simultaneously discouraging police from patrolling in high-crime areas.

Ja’Ron Smith, a former special assistant to President Trump for domestic policy who now leads Public Safety Solutions for America, a coalition dedicated to principles that solve violent crime, said:

It’s important to have the best data available so we can make educated decisions on how to best solve for violent crime. Crime is a local problem. Studies show that violent crime is highly concentrated amongst a very small network of people within each city, so we need to leverage data to create evidence-based policy solutions to make communities safer, rather than playing politics with people’s lives.

Seattle, Washington, has been at the forefront of anti-police policies. Since 2020, the Seattle Police Department lost 525 officers to resignations and retirement and is finding it increasingly difficult to find qualified recruits. Violent crime in 2022 was the highest in 15 years. Murders were up 24 percent in 2022 compared to the year before. Motor vehicle theft was up 30 percent, with almost 70 percent of vehicles never recovered. And last June, the city police’s sexual assault unit was so short of staff that it stopped working on new sexual assault cases.
